Barack Obama will be the fourth American President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
His diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will be handed over to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple was followed by an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will see its summum in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth President of the United States to receive it, but only the third President who will be awarded the prize in the Committee's own forum.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about war in Afghanistan when the prize was handed over.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who is leading a war in two countries at the moment.
He strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
During the ceremony Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of SEK 10 million (approximately EUR 1.1 million).
He intends to donate them to charitable works, but he has not yet decided which ones.
His programme will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that this is not a prize for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he said it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A defender of the nature accused of blackmail
The police of Litom theice charged with blackmail the president of the association Society of Protectors of the nature of Litom theice.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction works procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal benefit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman for the Litom the police.
Lubomír Studnička is the president of the Nature Protectors Society of Litom the United States.
He is currently in detention and is at risk of imprisonment for up to three years.
Waste sorting valves are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague, everyone can sort their packaging of drinks, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sorting legs at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take several minutes before you find the proper valves.
I don't mean to say that we wouldn't sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal advisers of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but above all because of the number of legs dedicated to these waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city centre?
It is a whole science, which requires mainly time and steel nerves.
The only place I've found for the moment is the place of Moravia in front of Potrefena Husa.
I don't like Mr. Unterka and his colleagues, but I don't like it.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it's not a sinecure either.
So to finish, many of my friends do not sort their waste.
By laziness.
It makes them a step to get to the legs.
I'm not surprised about them.
After a party, I offered to throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except that I didn't see any color rings on the street Kounicova.
Fortunately I found the right place by taking the tram.
That said, the waste was spilling over.
It's after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the best city, right?!
It is probably that ecology and so-called aesthetics are not too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first league hockey that shames the city throughout the country, instead of buying some extra legs and proposing the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad to have been able to reinforce my impression with official statistics after having dragged a moment on the Internet.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget has removed money from pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or public servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interests in State debt or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the government making loans for sensitive spending, pensions or sick leave. "It's only a matter of restoring problems later, to undermine the land," said Janota.
It is important to know that there is an increasing number of interest on the money borrowed and that it will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have the choice to find out where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social assistance or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those who the left has currently increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And afterwards, to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurances, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater government debt - next year it will not miss 163 billion in the cashier, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, debt will grow faster and faster and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The government will need money to renew it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be five billion to complete road and railway constructions due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly parts that have already been decided and started, and which cannot be modified in order to possibly reduce costs.
At the same time, keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major works, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to Karel Hanselka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to resolve the financial deficit very well - it will draw from the ČEZ dividends (electric supplier and distributor), which the state has in large part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that in no case is it an unsubstantiated well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts, or to provide a reserve for the reform of the prepared pensions.
Moreover, this tip increases the actual budget deficit by 5.7 percent of GDP according to EU rules.
And it's far from being the end of the carnival of transfers.
The budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crime, or even housing savings, decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the State can act without that money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save on the department side or, in the worst of cases, touch the government's budgetary reserve.
There is also a budget deficit of EUR 100 million for the two billion State Fund project, which is designed to monitor the expenditure of each administration on-line.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find any money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would have to take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow users to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
It's just a button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the US company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them into staff and professionals
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and it was made a first demonstration a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means fictional.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a Nokia N800 modified with 128 MB RAM, which simultaneously executed the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is on the rise.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to the current 2012 devices.
The lack of snow in the mountains will track the hoteliers
The desert tracks do not pose a problem only to climb-up operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and bed and breakfasts.
Therefore, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
The Internet users travel through the offers, ask for the prices but do not dare to commit themselves to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If we want to spend the New Year's Eve of his dreams at Špindlerův Mlýn, it is best not to hesitate to reserve.
If the savings are given priority and the quality of the accommodation comes only after that, then one can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of Špindler are currently offering only one week's stays for the New Year.
I think they're going to try to place them for a while, but they'll also give up and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will decline rapidly," Jandura said.
The tourism agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas week at the moment, it is not completely sold.
It remains free, let's say, half the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared a few last minute less expensive Christmas stays," said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The tourist agency of Vrchlabí can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first 14 days of February are just as good, while the remaining winter stays are on average sold.
This year, interest in winter stays was negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks cover during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schiefert thinks.
On the other hand, the occupancy of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sn thekou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places left for New Year's Eve as well as for Christmas.
There is a great deal of interest during the holidays of January of the Polish and February also sells," says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central car park of Jánské Lázně is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year's period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent Jánské Lázně hotel.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have 60 percent of the current occupation.
February is a little weaker at the moment but as soon as the snow falls, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow again indicated the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
However, hoteliers in Krkonoše should not hope for more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there is precipitation, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But afterwards, time is expected to warm up," Jakubský informs of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
He also became a comic, assiduous effort, with which Barack Obama, president known as wise, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he considered to be very simple himself.
When he finally let his doctrine sweat so much expected, he turned out to have copied it to carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is more, to use the title of the Bush speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new way forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending further reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsibility and catastrophic decision in its consequences."
However, the following months showed that Bush's strategy, which was based on recommendations from campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be successful to such an extent that the current newspapers are not talking at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, it said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favourable final situation than one could hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months, but without a better option, he at least smuggled the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to lift the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally had 10,000.
What brings the most problems throughout Obama's strategy seems to be her intention to withdraw Afghanistan's armies within 18 months and to complete this process within three years. All Obama's doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bring the same fruitage as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricist wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - no one can count on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to change their leadership day by day according to what arranges them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only a powder in the eyes of the patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is uniquely complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity in relation to the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "prompt state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporal horizon of Obama's strategy makes perplexed by its voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the verge of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the turmoil of the war for their "return home" will bring a true miracle there.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect admission of the U.S. defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is counterproductive.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and strengthened sanctions do not affect Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of solving the problem through the use of military force.
It will have to be answered, for example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of the Afghan troops.
Each such solution will, however, result in a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only ruse for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for it to plan on a new strategy, if it proves to be a total fiasco.
Bank leaders Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses
The senior executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
Society announced it to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 principal leaders will receive actions instead of money, which they will not be able to resell before five years.
Actions can be taken away from leaders if they take too much risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus leading the effort to link remuneration to long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning to be taken, indicated the former investment bank Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank became the target of criticisms after setting aside nearly $17 billion for bonuses over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, strong bank premiums have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it planned to apply a single 50 per cent tax on bankers' bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women received Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
They are five women, a record number, who today received in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prizes in technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for chromosome research with their compatriots Jack Szostak.
The chemistry award was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriots Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to Charles Kao scientists for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith withWillard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the Certificate of Acquisition of the Pecuniary Award.
It reaches SEK 10 million in each category. (approximately EUR 1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward among themselves.
The much-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to American President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward, since he was only at the beginning of his career and he was also the leader of a country engaged in two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
To the discharge of his policy he added that in certain situations war is essential for peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is planning to resign. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who weighs his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the House of Deputies.
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the firm will be on the agenda of their Friday appointment.
Klaus also criticises the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further increases the public finance crisis.
It was the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed about the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget legislation that will be signed by Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, on Wednesday the Chamber of Deputies validated the left's proposals on money transfers and increased the remuneration of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Democrats for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left-hand side, the government, Klaus and the right-hand side, which called into question the future of Fischer's firm, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
The criticisms state that the budget, as voted by the Members of Parliament, removes the package of economic measures that the Fischer government has taken and which, according to it, must contain the indebtedness of the state.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but does not require it, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "unfortunable deficit" of public finances.
Now, according to him, there is no positive solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement if it could build on a consensus of the wider political parties, according to the President.
The President of the ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is scary and that the government should call into question its subsequent existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "drastic verdicts".
The head of the ČSSD Ji the Paroubek has responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is frightening and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Wednesday already, the ČSSD qualified as a success the ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The People ' s Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman is going to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that Hollywood Invictus' new film - Inconvince will expose many things to the world about the country, its struggles and its victories.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor rewarded for the Oscars, incarnates Nelson Mandela's film on life, tirelessly fighting the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it's a eighty-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate her in the movie.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who has been rewarded with a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Milion Dollar Baby drama in the middle of the box has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery that has become itself a slave, a fictitious president of the United States, or even a god in the movie Evan All-Powering but never a living encore and as important for so many people as Mandela.
The former South African State man was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in support of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word that is unconvinced and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unite the country. President Mandela, who is newly elected, knows that his country remains still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced to be able to unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the world's outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring the story of Mandela to the big screen.
I didn't have any other goal or play this role in order to bring it closer to reality," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor stated that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to hold his hand.
I realized that when I tighten your hand, I recover your energy, it transmits and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important to me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the rough middle of the rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie'.
Despite the differences between the real actors and the real models, Invictus, under the auspices of the director Eastwood, received positive opinions and we are even talking about ambitions for Oscars.
Todd McCarthy's review of the Daily Variety newspaper summarized his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well-conducted film."
In the film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com site, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange light phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has only recognised yesterday that it has tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the "Bulava" type missile, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, Bulava didn't fly, or she damaged herself in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test started at a normal start.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the equipment again.
It's obviously the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew away from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donsky, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be just set on fire from a moving and submerged vessel
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by a flying object not precisely identified it was likely by a defective "Bulava".
The Norwegians have not doubted for a moment that this is a Russian rocket.
The generals allege that this time we cannot speak of absolute failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the aquaria affected only the third.
In previous cases, engines failed on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches have gone unobtrusively, the Department of Defence's management considers that only six out of thirteen failed.
This rate of success of almost 50 percent thus fills the general optimism and therefore they always claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even carry ten nuclear hypersonic cores with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will perform again in a 51-year-old professional match.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will hand-fed his Moscow CSKA team in need and will probably enter the match of Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the President of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov is trained regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still need to settle some details on the form, says the coach of the club Sergey Nyemthinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are capable of strengthening the mind of other players, said Nyemchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus became the oldest professional professional hockey player in Russia.
In the NHL, legendary attacking Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and won 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and one of the most successful.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union, he scored gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven World Champion titles, and triumphed at the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he won the honours also in the NHL where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancels every overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel every overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime hours that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
Spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant confirmed it.
The management, however, wants to reach agreement with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why additional volunteer hours were proposed on Saturday 19 December, knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The Sedmička.cz site indicated that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange for additional hours.
Either they receive the supplement for the additional hours, or they can make a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their party year-end indicated Vaněk.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in union comments and claims such as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel every overtime for December," Vaněk said.
Until last week, car factory employees were forced to work almost two hours more than their eight hours a day.
The unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the automotive plant and the trade unions is scheduled for Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař stated on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state of strike in the event of an agreement on their claims and the signing of a common document.
The situation in the factory peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously took a strike due to incessant additional hours.
They also protested against the bad conditions of pay and alleged wheezing.
The management argued with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the auto production requirements.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also asked that no sanctions be imposed on workers who had ceased production.
Trade unions ask society to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a payment of 5 000 crowns (about €209) for them.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started production in series last year in November.
It produced approximately 80,000 vehicles up to September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "durable" HIV viruses also
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
In some cases, this reality takes precedence over the fact that the combination is not as intense on the common variants of the virus as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present.
However, the lives of the sick can be radically extended through a mixture of medicines that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this proliferation results in the development of what is known as resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT in Prague and Heidelberg University opens the way to a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the spread of HIV.
Metalocarborans are a combination of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of the researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their links to the proteins of the virus.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiwall cages are formed by bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A virus betrays and resists.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, mature infectious particles of the virus would not occur.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus will also be stopped in the patient's body, explaining the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (cf. table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test pieces as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the common version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however, it does not fail on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to examine further in order to develop effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlína  the director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS takes over from Fischer, who defends himself.
The President of the ODS (Civil Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek described the budget ratified for the following year as "unsettling", and he said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister described the SDO as a drastic verdict.
He says take some time to analyze.
The spokesman for the ODS Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an administrative firm supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to give support to the minority in the Chamber of Deputies who are concerned about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about remaining in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and the Democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget on Wednesday, however, with proposals for amendments of 12 billion crowns included on the left.
The House increased the money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint to the proposals of the Democrats was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
The SDO left the room before the vote, thus complying with the government's wish that an amended budget be a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and inapplicability
The Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the event of ratification of amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after his move to the government:
He also indicated that he was wondering if he was going to remain in his duties.
His disappointment at the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of ČSSD, who imposed budgetary changes, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the Chief of the Fischer Government and the whole government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing to harm, said Topolánek in a text message from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments were asking for TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decides to give up his resignation in the face of fighting against the amount of public finances deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that he should be based on the majority of the left who is currently in the Chamber."
That said, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and once it's on the agenda, then I'll devote myself to it, said from the House to journalists, Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew away in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO has stepped back at the Prime Minister's request.
At the same time, Nečas stressed that the SDO would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the Democrats to allow the budget to be voted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he replied to the question of whether the ODS had not been blamed by the President of the Party in the House or in the country when the budget was negotiated.
I did not notice that my vote would have been missing.
I already knew at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolshevising of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek replied in person.
According to the new ČD schedules there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit certain express or regional trains less loaded from 13 December and, on the contrary, will strengthen some others.
Total transportation coverage will decrease to the day of entry into force of the new two-percent schedule compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic and reduced rates.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino ram.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest drop in transport concerns the region of Hradec Králové by a total of eight percent, whereas Prague and its surrounding areas can be pleased with an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the traffic of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice will be reduced only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest changes, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburb system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague's main railway station (Praha Hlavní nádra, Prague).
The ČD will introduce more SC lines Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart at intervals of two hours.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino until Bratislava on December 13th.
This year's bill for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in a total of four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a ten-year contract, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not use an increase in prices for the vast majority of transport vehicles.
The changes will affect only the tickets of a ČD Net day and the Internet tickets at a reduced price eLiška.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The eLiška price will newly depend on the route travelled, whereas until then it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single price of 160 crowns.
Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, children released
Today, the rebels kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed about it, but it only spoke 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight o'clock, as well as one of the teachers.
Taking hostages took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used hostages as human shields in a leak in front of the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to reach an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police first prosecuted the rapists as a result of violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the Governor's administration elections there were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the South Philippines was arrested as a result of suspicions of participation in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood arrives in the American halls in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and laughs at part of the life of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against globally known apartheid has returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen by Mandela himself years ago to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in the theatre, the feedback from critics and the public is being heard.
Nelson Mandela
In his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is on the one hand in full preparation for the football World Cup, and on the other hand because the media are agitated by disturbing news as to the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to AP, the reactions to the new film are at the moment quite positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations about the main roles where "pavanating" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film by taking his own words.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have been well prepared.
I have also met Nelson Mandela on many occasions personally in order - as is said - to recover from his energy, he said at the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember the personality and message of Mandela through the film.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual he added.
Wear the jersey of the national rugby team
The film based on the story of British writer John Carlin's novel is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people portray the South African human rights defender during his presidential term.
Morgan Freeman therefore tries during the film to pick up two racial groups from a long divided population and just like Nelson Mandela in 1995 he dressed up the South African national jersey team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won at that time.
For showing up on the jersey lawn, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been long ovated fourteen years ago mainly from the white public and was recognized by the white people.
Let's hope that the football championship will succeed in reuniting people into a single nation," said rugby Chester Williams, the only "black" player in the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
The South African whites are skeptical, however, as recently entrusted in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the region of Louny
A fire swallowed up in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps from the distribution center near the commune of V thekov na Lounsku.
According to Lukka Marvan, spokesman for the firefighters of Ústí, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally expected to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinion and put out the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one has been injured and according to the spokesman of Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated to be some tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure may be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a nine.
It adds that in ten years of activity Čeps has experienced nothing similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electrical power supplies have not been interrupted, says the spokesperson of ČEZ for Northern Bohemia So the Holingerova Hendrychova, and the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been affected by the fire at the processing plant.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of the 400 kV and 220 kV transmission and power lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transport units to the distribution units and lines of 4339 kilometres in length.
Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will today file a complaint for defamation against three social Democrat prefects.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the South Moravian region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the Prefect of the Olomouc region of Martin Tesak.
Jančura indicated it in Dvacet minute from Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
All regions, however, have concluded long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three of us attacked us and said that we were making fine mouths, while only one offer was made for what they wanted themselves to do.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech railways that were signed last week.
So it's only up to us to defend ourselves.
It's in exchange for slanders about the student agency, said Jančura to Radiožurnál.
He also indicated that he had evidence that no region had done so in accordance with European law.
This is why we are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura's complaint is the result of his media show, which serves him as free advertising for his company and for his person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other Prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the adverse actions of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will stop the campaign after Christmas and that he plans to take it back after the New Year.
He said that the campaign would focus on corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura started its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust to the Czech railways the operation of rail links for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought threats to Jančura by a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licences.
He presented himself as a Member of the ČSSD, I do not know who it is, but I will not say his name, said Jančura today in Radiožurnál.
pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease will overthrow old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay for vaccines.
Specialists are also clear about the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for August children.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal disease.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination was started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid for.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
Yet parents paid 1600 crowns or more for a dose.
Immunization of the youngest requires four doses.
Specialists estimate that each year health insurance spends SEK 300 to 450 000 in vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
Up to now, the State has spent about 500,000 crowns a year on the entire vaccination of children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcal infections are the cause of middle ear inflammation, but also serious infections such as meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there were up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský said that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcal diseases.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that needs to be followed now, said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not considering it at all at the moment," said his spokesman Vlastimil Srše, ".
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Special Pediatric Society, recognizes that a voluntary vaccination based on her defects.
If all children were vaccinated, one could consider a decrease in the renewals of the vaccines "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making the vaccination optional," however, says Cabrnochová.
Specialists expect that as early as next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will make their infants vaccinated.
Vaccination against pneumococcal diseases also breaks out because it is the first child vaccination that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus saving them on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
This, however, is linked to the concerns of the practitioner paediatrician, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance companies, while doctors receiving them in the same way as other state-provided vaccine products.
Some Members, however, were concerned that this would allow insurance to "deduct the amounts of health insurance".
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait until the insurance pays them back.
Pediatricians are estimated to have to invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month individually in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "museum flight"
The son of Frank Frazetta, a renowned illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings for a value of $20 million ( GBP 12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance of the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81 years old, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the press agency Associated Press (AP).
AP quoted a police officer that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52 years old, claimed to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," reported the agency.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied to give such an authorization, said the agency.
Labour is in favour of increasing the budget tax.
Ministers defended the increase in the tax and reductions in expenditure announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism of the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by delaying his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by attacking low and average wages.
Among its main proposals, it is possible to see an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a ceiling of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages were penalized by a recession of which they were not responsible and warned that "problems" announced.
The decline in social insurance - which will bring about GBP 3 billion a year - has put the world of business in anger, because he believes it is a tax on jobs, whereas the objective should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGETT REPORT
Social Insurance will increase by 0.5% again from April 2011
The economy will fall further than expected 4,75% this year
New 50% tax on bank bonuses
The increase in company profits tax for small companies was abandoned
Taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, a person earning GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and a person earning GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while a person earning GBP 10,000 per year will earn GBP 110 more.
The Ministers stated that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 was "hard decisions" but stressed that 60% of the additional tax burden would be borne by the first 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary to the Treasury, rejected an increase in the tax and emphasized that a decrease in spending was a " drop of water in the ocean" compared to what was necessary.
"These figures are important and they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he said to the BBC.
Timms said he was confident and that growth in the economy would start again at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% forecast in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP higher than the pre-estimate.
"Equipment missing"
The Conservatives who will launch this Thursday a new advertising campaign warning against the "debt crisis" of the Labour, said that the project to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" electing difficult choices until after the elections - which are due to take place in June 2010.
"They presented nothing significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary to the Treasury of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour stresses that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from the coming reductions, contrary to the Tory proposals that would result in a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems said that the money collected through increased taxes and reduced spending would be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on the wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC's political editor, said that the announcement schedule - such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor face propaganda charges, the money being just recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fail budget"
Although ministers did not publish expenditure details beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that public spending restrictions would begin to be felt only in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Études Fiscales) has stated that the Chancellor's figures in the future involve substantial reductions in many areas, including potential transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is only delayed," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report, and the markets are well aware of it."
FBI investigation into "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, announced the American embassy in Pakistan, at the BBC.
The FBI reported that he was investigating whether it was the same men who were reported missing from their home in the US state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as Pakistani ancestry, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schwein, FBI spokesman, said that the agency had been aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and if it is true that the students are missing," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said that the house was already being monitored by the local police and that no charges against the arrested men had yet been brought.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused any comment on the arrests, reported the Reuters press agency, but stated that the United States should "co-operate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to derail the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students had been removed from their home by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights have been as little respected as ever in the last twenty years, according to the Amnesty International association's report.
the report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran denied previous criticisms of its lack of respect for human rights.
The authorities have argued that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands have been arrested and dozens have been killed in Iran, after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's controversial election has led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, the BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, states that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"Fake Confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of "Working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the results of the election.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and half conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate who lost his election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuse had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who claimed to have been locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty accepted that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and government response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these agencies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent other demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to transform the Bristol site into a track for competitions.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park track, a small pond was leading a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that the view from the top of the runway was beautiful but that it was rather intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city shining down below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's last book, "Why the French don't like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for some fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious scene.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country at the moment.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now supply in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very well aware of listening to and reproducing discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or at the mayor's (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
These are the practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally in agreement with their legal counterparts of a purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today form a small part of European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wondered how French politicians (and the so virulent intellectual elite of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to compromise historically with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, we are tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural story of the symbol of the Great North, the polar bear.
Connoisseur of the history and complicated policies of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter, then brave 14-year-old who had only to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, caught as they were swimming alongside their mother, were just killed, caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
In the early 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually one millionth of the surface required for an adult in freedom.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often comes back to the threat of hunters to species survival.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit motorcycle Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain for the longest time.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alon Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a catchy insight into what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherists nor oceanographers can accurately relate the speed of change.
It's not wrong to try.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th century, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering trips gave the first information on the melt of the ice cap.
The submarines of the Cold War then mapped the changes in the sub-seas relief.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the biggest of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Anderson is looking at the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by the salty water nets pressed into gelling.
But from the above mentioned bear to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it might be our turn."
Marines, among the 6,000 people who deposited crowns on the tombs in Arlington
Angello Robinson's first 19-year-old made a seven-hour bus trip to lay a crown on a soldier's grave that he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greet men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place," Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If I can, I'd like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers gathered Saturday morning to lay crowns on the tombs of veterans, in different sections of Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the memorial, and others decided to decorate hundreds of graves in Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, travel each year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honour of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (Krones across America), which aims to promote the event in all the other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs of Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of Fayetteville National Cemetery en Arkansas cemetery, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the memorial site for the victims of Unit Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation provided more than $150,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, stated that she had travelled to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed themselves.
This is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Embroidered in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between lawns and the wide hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as from the Vietnam war, because they are not as often visited as the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, while the children were playing and the couples were holding by hand, carrying fresh pine crowns on grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green colour, with a small red butterfly knot on the top.
Closely, silence was heard about Section 60, where most veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends fought in cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned to see the small black and white information cards, plunged into wetland for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many tears mothers on her son's grave.
She was part of Zanesfield, Ohio, and had spent eight hours gathering on the tomb of the Sergeant of Marine GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in the battle in July.
Nobody should ever forget that we're free... my son paid for that, she said.
"Long after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested a U.S. citizen who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, claiming the services of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific accusations were not made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All the so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, cause the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how husbands are being followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but permissions have always been denied.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the Communist brothers' government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which pursues a "soft" approach in order to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, so that the United States can do so.
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors to the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to connect often must communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a major mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be permitted -- distributing mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba," said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his oldest sick brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries begin to engage in a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities identified a supposed organization to prepare a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this case would lead to the dismantling of an important network of terrorist recruiters who were running the Internet for radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they chased a hidden insurgent figure, known as Saivelah, who invited these men to Pakistan after having discovered them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
When they arrived in Pakistan, they were guided by Saivelah, who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's Tribal Belt, Al-Qaida Home and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret services who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saivelah had failed to convince the Al-Qaida commanders that these men did not participate in the CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east that have become a refuge of terrorism.
They were considered as infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition of keeping the anonymity due to the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary permissions to get entry into al-Qaida camps when arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- remaining in Pakistan and being interviewed by the FBI -- insists on the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists, in determining who gives their trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services have had the priority of infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also pay more attention, in recent years in the choice of the people they accept because American secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model than so many others have already followed?
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen are asking for a "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of protesters walked on the streets here on Saturday asking for more climate action from the negotiators working in the palace of the Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 were estimated by the police.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On that day when little happened during the discussions on the United Nations-sponsored climate, thousands of activists walked through the city, deploying signs in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish saying 'The Earth says it has enough'.
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru's mother's home country opened her eyes to the tearing problems that the country has to face because of the impact of climate change that is already happening."
That's one of the reasons why I decided to join the big march -- to get the word out and to appeal to the world's leaders to make just, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to keep the anonymity because of its involvement in the climate discussions, activists wearing masks and black clothing turned on several explosives near the main Copenhagen canal, which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They launched them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, the people were gathered around TV screens to follow the march throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that protesters have failed to awaken the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, that's something I didn't realize.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He observed that walking may seem harmful or useful from the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and the different sectors in the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
Test results reveal persistent differences between breeds
The federal report last week on mathematical results provided good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District remains still far behind the main institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more advanced in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Progress in Education) show the persistent gap between African-American and white results at both local and national levels.
The average results of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington D.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African American classmates have increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the success gap increased from 53 points to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
Afro-American progress in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, with only one point falling, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results as the sample was not sufficiently large.
The overall view over a six-year period is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between blacks and whites in grade 4 (cm1) when the district's first NAEP report was published was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups increased over this period, the difference was only 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by the Director of the group of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven by the white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in district education.
I do not jump for one or two winning points," said Kwame R. Brown (apparently Democrat), a member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4 at Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown stated that the message from test results is that middle schools (colleges) in the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect them.
But what scares us is that we do not devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee stated that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at school students in the elementary and early school classes who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their school career and who are quite late compared to their peers.
Every day, the mathematics program, for the Kindergarten (material) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and experiences of real life, as they were set up in the District by the former head of the Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think that we need to continue to work to offer better interventions to these lower-level students, said Rhee.
Others feel that the NAP results pose the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of the tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighbourhoods of Washington.
This may therefore have a political impact that hinders this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other superintendents of schools, it tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, whatever their origin, can be assured that their children can get excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap in success was the length of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change," said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "base of departure" to get a further increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise of the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and flashes a moment of the eyes at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students in the group explored Gettysburg where tuition costs are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of a new, impressed student than enthusiastic.
Super That's where I'm going to study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide directed them towards the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she says dreamy, when she was told the low ratio teacher of law - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to the university:
The question is where.
Although this is still a major issue for the large number of American children born to Afghan immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents at adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands of young people to benefit from university education, which will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "an "second generation" in five per cent of his studies in high school -- a notable success if one considers that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, says the researchers, they open the way for the next generations who will play an important role in the labour force of the country.
Researchers studying batters claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an inherent need to succeed.
Many parents also set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with U.S. schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her reach university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them," said Patricia Gándara, a Davis researcher, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides over $300 million a year to local school systems to organize preparatory programs at the university that start when students of low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum gets agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has succeeded in attracting important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies in China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, which has been disabled by decades of war and sanctions.
The US companies left with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who put an auction lost.
Two American companies obtained contracts for the auctioned fields in June.
The weak representation of the American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies have opened the way," said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a web site.
It will take a lot of time for another offer to be made in Iraq.
Concerns about security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops retreated, hindered U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which owns the world's third largest crude oil reserve, the analysts say.
In some cases, U.S. companies were disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and which were more willing to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The largest American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and provided technical advice, left empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, has more on contracts than other companies and has left with significant participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power," said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The pre-selected companies to submit auctions made offers that were then compared to the baril rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaida was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, which hit the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of Al-Qaida's operations this week, declared the American counter-intelligence authorities on Friday.
If the information is confirmed, that would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles launched into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
The local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by a CIA-type unmanned aircraft within the Anarchic Tribal Border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistan's civilian secret services, speaking on Miran Shah's phone.
The authorities stated that the local suspected activists rushed into the area and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally decomposed bodies".
It was totally impossible for the local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorism representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the deaths.
Somali was described as one of Al-Qaida's Military Organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organise plotting around the world, stated one of the authorities that wanted to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes within Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority said that Somali had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the American public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major character of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of activists in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The rate of attacks by the CIA drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures from the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a not-for-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups who have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also mercilessly killing suspected informants, says the site.
UN Special Envoy in Kabul withdraws
The United Nations Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he was going to resign from his position in March, at the end of a tumultuous term of office filled with extensive allegations of corruption during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure occurs when the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the United States timetable for the withdrawal of troops that would begin within 18 months and that would force the other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community," said Eide in a phone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military Powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he did not resign but would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said that it was better to start looking for my replacement," said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to United Nations officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives claimed that the name of Staffan di Mistura had been named; it was a Italian-Switzerland citizen who recently presided over a United Nations mission to Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who had previously led the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of promoting President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which was thanked -- had "damaged the mission as there was already a good dose of scepticism regarding the international observation of the elections".
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged those responsible for the United Nations to allow their successors to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than they were assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limitations of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that heavy United Nations recruitment regulations were impeding its ability to bring new talent.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert M. Gates, stated on Friday that the world's major powers would soon impose "important additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in negotiations on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a party of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week's visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, detracted from the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a resolution. ̈
One of the things that weighs me most is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said that a "set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to convince the Iranian Government that it would in fact be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people would suffer immensely from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokeswoman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the Administration joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme back in full conformity with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a significant part of its enriched uranium storage, in exchange for the desperately necessary fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a means of building trust on both sides and saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have been far from reaching agreement - in part, the experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
In my opinion, the stiffening of Iran against some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually agreed in early October has led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not envisaged, in the wake of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set 31 December as Iran's deadline for responding to the proposals, before turning to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "enhanced sanctions".
In a statement made in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unsubstantiated allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue the talks with the United States and five other major global Powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane to the rich Kurdish oil region to meet the troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are continuing tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income-sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delay in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurdish anxiety about the suspended withdrawal. The American authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not forsake you."
In aging China, a change in direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters celebrating them, "The Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "A baby in addition, it is a grave in addition".
They have so learned the lesson that the authorities of the Shanghai Government, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the ageing population, have radically changed direction this summer and have begun to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction has been instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to a single child.
We don't have a second left," said Wang, 31-year-old Human Resources Director, who has an eight-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of a single child's policy in China, creating two generations of single children, well known with good toys and spoiled, nicknamed the "small emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell by 1.8 children per couple from six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent labour shortages in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" she said.
Progressive mitigation
The Chinese single-child policy, which was drafted in 1978, is the most controversial obligation imposed by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and face discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have given the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women of a second child to abortion.
In addition, many couples used selective abortions leading to an abnormally high male - female ratio.
In recent years, public authorities have gradually weakened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorisation.
The city's government has sent family planners and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and drag leaflets under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Deceptive response
Although officials in a rural town in the suburbs of Shanghai said they saw an increase in requests for second-child couple files after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the municipality of Caolu, Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to take care of their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, stated that they would love to have two children and that they were legally permitted to do so.
But, like many Chinese, they only have the government's minimum health insurance and life insurance.
Without social protection, they say the decision would be irresponsible.
The Westerns wrongly consider the policy of the single child to be a rights issue, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the first child of the couple.
That's right, we're gonna be lucky to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
That's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Officer, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of her own. "We were the centre of the family and used to everyone taking care of us."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says so most strongly.
For couples working in the middle class working at two, who bring down the birth rate, he says, it is necessary to be selfish if we are to succeed.
The 20- or 30-year-olds grew up seeing their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there's space issues -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has plans for reducing emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- which has so far been characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual reprisals -- has returned under the spotlight of the disaster on Friday, as a result of the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden, in the coming years.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it clarified the path to be taken.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that are short of time, with more than 100 leaders from around the world coming to Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not say how many rich countries would give to the poor to withstand climate change, in the current and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
He gave great flexibility to the process," said John Coequyt, Representative at the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described as the "complete picture" of the United Nations climate change, Yvo de Boer.
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, in the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched the negotiations on Friday by promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbal altercations have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States representative for climate negotiations rejected any discussion that required the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with voluntary efforts by the major emerging economies, if they were not financed by developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama administration is becoming harder on China than Bush administration two years ago.
The United States is not going to sign an agreement without efforts and actions from the major developing countries," said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister, He Yafei said that the US chief negotiator, either lacked "good sense," or was "extremely irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not financially help China to combat climate warming.
With the future economic paths of the major world powers at stake, defects have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle concerns more the saving of individual economies than the saving of the planet, with China and the United States waging about their respective obligations while the poorer nations insist that the two dozens of the most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives of acting more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers fought to find out who should be suffering the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, although vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make major emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed," said Ulate, who is also an advisor on climate for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries that are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to put pressure on them to get a treaty legally binding in Copenhagen, although most key participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a proposal for a 24-page treaty, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of Climate Unity of the European Commission, said that the action of the small island states "has put political pressure on the complete political process", partly because of what they are now unified and that they are asking for the emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debate became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the issues before the Heads of Government reached agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Environment of India, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister descended from their aircraft and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The real image of the gathering -- in which 13,000 people come and come out of the Palais des Congrès every day -- of the guitarists present night shows mocking themselves of the countries that they think are betraying and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the Grand Court, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the International Conservation Policy.
Heavy goods vehicles are coming.
In Great Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine the Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle blows through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburb train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin suburb train outside London.
He hoped that the new service would enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and would link the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The lost small holes will become flourishing suburbs, the length of business trips will be much less, and the passage from the aircraft and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties join this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railway network, the inevitable planning battle and the fears of environmental hazards could slow British high-speed lines down.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a corporation created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will report its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route for the next stage for the high-speed network.
The new London-West Midlands line will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up up to 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to have three options for a higher-speed network going north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another heading northeast, towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that it will be the best performance option" said a rail professional.
When it is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The original track is designed to allow trains of 400m length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal with a capacity of 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is anticipated that an existing station will be enlarged to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first have to run off high-speed lines on the existing rails north of Birmingham, retaining journey times between London and Scotland longer than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a transition from aircraft to trains, making it a point of reference for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay the 75,000 GBP loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the principal member of the Tory Parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orange factory he built in his constituency home.
The party leader who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that the members of parliament were "departure", increased his loan by GBP 75,000 to build an oak extension to his second house in Rutland.
He was authorized to have the additional interest paid, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commonwealth authorities received complaints at that time and were not interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan stated that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to his house, describing it in his plans as an orange reef.
Neighbours describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to explain the increase in borrowings in a recent investigation by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Commons concerning his pre-loan provisions.
The Committee has, last month, called upon the State party to take action against all allegations of non-compliance, following an investigation into its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of the 271.406 GBP loan of his London property at the home of his constituency which he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about GBP 1,400 per month of loan interest until March of last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The RBS interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The standard RBS interest rate rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as the Ghost Office Manager in September, after a covert journalist filmed him saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expenditure scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated like "the m...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for more sacredly, but I did not."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil negotiator, began to have to explain his expenses, in May, after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the expense office that it might "be considered excessive".
An activist dug a £hole in Mr. Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed that he had requested £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the loan, last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for major improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg."
He added: "There are no problems with debossing or developing or using rules or anything.
It was perfectly clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It could not be more clear or simpler."
Faithful, come and see the calendar of Brighton's Advent
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for every day of December, using Noel's songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1st, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. each day, with pasta and wine served free of charge.
The songs of Noel chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove marketing assistant, is an unpaid priest of the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We wish religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should come closer to people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the beach cabin Advent calendar came just after a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on combating global global warming and in Copenhagen, where the police conducted several hundred interrogations.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, 100 thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, to reach an agreement by Friday to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization on climate throughout the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, has helped to make the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the start of the cortège, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, broke glass windows with paws and hammers, found a journalist from the AFP.
Anti-sluggish police officers immediately intervened without any cleaning.
In total, the police announced the interrogation of 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violet groups, which had in particular been shown at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinction", stressing that about 100 of them "had always been held in the street on Saturday evening "missed and kept seated despite the extreme cold".
Parliamentary party, the cortège, quite a good child, took over the leadership of the Bella Center, a negotiating site.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without seeking to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Desmond Tutu.
The majority of demonstrators had come in cars and trains from the major cities in Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in impermeable blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are going down the streets to claim compensation for ecological debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say ourselves: we have time, appreciated the Benedictian singer Angélic Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, rivers where you can walk as you had never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the Almondist movement has drawn closer to environmental organizations.
French Member of Parliament José Bové, a figure of alternative globalism, explained that he had come to Copenhagen for "climate and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many particularly vulnerable islands to warming, had launched demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for the most part, marched in red, wearing bandanas worshipping solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, gatherings of a few hundred protesters were also held to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
On Saturday, Abkhazia elected its President, a little more than a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closing, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on Saturday to Sunday night.
The five candidates, among them the outgoing President, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikhail Saakachvili, "regrets that Abkhazia fell under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating itself from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said to AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who said he voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a nice white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential in this region with sumptuous landscapes, along the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the President and Russian Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Beslan Archba, the district head, has reserved a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the electoral process.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements with Moscow last year, such as the one handing over to Russia control the Abkhaz Railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims neither support the current power nor opposition.
A 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: global demonstrations, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the living, called for nearly 700 people on the margins of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, about 100 thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which until 18 December welcomes delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliamentary party, the cortège, a generally good child, took the lead at the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without seeking to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the start of the cortège, a group of a few hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, found a journalist from the AFP.
Anti-sluggish police officers immediately surrounded them and intervened without shelter, throwing several of them on the ground.
The police announced the interrogation of 600 to 700 people, indicating that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these ultra-violet groups, which had in particular been shown at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured to the jaw by a paved and four cars burned near a squad during incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to the police.
We watched the extremist groups, warned the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces were turning into the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came in cars and trains from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in impermeable blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today, we are going down the streets to claim compensation for ecological debt for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the Almondist movement has drawn closer to environmental organizations.
French Euro MP José Bové, a figure of alternative globalism, told the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization mobilized several personalities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen, the former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who was to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many particularly vulnerable islands to warming, had launched demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, students for the most part, have manifested, dressed in red and wearing bandanas worshipping solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, gatherings of a few hundred protesters were also held to demand action against climate change.
In France, events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
The history-geo is reinforced by the reform of the general school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to be published in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "reinforced" from general school reform, despite the removal of their compulsory education in the scientific terminal.
From now on, the first students will have every four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "we have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S sector is no longer a scientific sector" but "in general, it focuses on the best students".
ES and L can't stay under the S, he goes on to stress: "I haven't heard a lot of historians and intellectuals indignant by the absence of history-geography in terminal in technological high schools either".
On Saturday, an Ifop survey published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) disagreed with the government's plan to abolish mandatory teaching of the history-geography in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it was not "no matter" to delete the philosophy of the terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which according to them sacrificed the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will cover their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will cover their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also take training sessions during the year of M2 and will be a first year in front of the students as trainees.
If you add up all the courses offered before the contest, you already get more presence in front of the students, which is more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister states that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist at National Education".
He also reaffirms the plan to delete the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge raised Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Normal Superior School of Street of Ulm.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of expert interventions, fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, saw a journalist from the AFP.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the margins of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this day who takes his name from that given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
Some 20 participants are selected from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Concerning global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but using graphics, in front of some 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will hold that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record".
Videos from these conferences will be posted on the school's website from December 15th.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delays in payments: anger of prison overseers, planned actions
Unions of prison overseers called for the "general mobilization" on Friday to require the payment of overtime premiums and overtime by the end of the year, which was deferred to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitentiary (2nd Union of Supervisors) has asked staff who will not be in service to protest in the prison facilities on Tuesday morning and to "block" them to "declar theft of their dues".
The CGT Penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "convene in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilization", finding "hontous and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "additional hours, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first surveillance union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to bring back dissatisfaction and anger".
The Penitentiary Administration Directorate and the Department of Justice explained that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but ensured that the remaining hours would be paid in January.
The Chancellery specified at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the surveillance unions guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I do not know the efforts of staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the prison administration to put in place, without delay, a set of measures to ensure that this situation, resulting from a poor assessment of the number of additional hours, will not happen again in the future, says Alliot-Marie.
The December fee will therefore be low, except for senior management with the famous job and objective bonuses, the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budget constraints are good".
It is a pure scandal, and the interregional FO of Marseilles has indigned itself by announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all the meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays unless those in October are regularized in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare to take advantage of the staff resources, the CGT Penitentiary of Bordeaux estimates.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less well-departed than others.
But anyway the account is not there, noted the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas Obama says to offer "more cute tricks" than those he receives
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, entrusted the small Oprah Winfrey screen with a simple gift rule: "I give things better than the ones I receive".
As part of a special show to be broadcast on the ABC channel Sunday evening, the President and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end of the year celebrations in their new and prestigious remains.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be in the game.
Santa also likes Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "surely" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama went against her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he received: "Certainly not, I offered you nice gifts last year," she tattooed the president.
Absolutely, it was forced to admit before repeating with humour by showing the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who offered you this?".
During this one-hour show, in the relaxed atmosphere, with the famous hostess who was Barack Obama's strong support during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favourite gifts as children.
Barack Obama referred to a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball ball that his father Kenya did rarely see offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my father coming to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball ball, said the president.
It was only later in my life that I realized that he had given me this balloon.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL says he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles because of "lesions" important after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-opened on Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors found "necessity from the operation" of the discal hernia suffered in Paris on November 26th, told Paris its press department, stating that these injuries had "necessity of a repair operation".
However, the singer's press department wanted to reassure itself that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be issued no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday, however, would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only within 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the condition of the patient when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Asked by the AFP, the press service has neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux , a well-known doctor in the artistic environment.
This one was not available Thursday evening to comment on the information from RTL.
Following his operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for post-intervention infection.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close relative of Johnny Hallyday, estimated on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured himself "no concern" for the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He called me just before he went to Los Angeles, and I told him it was a bullshit because making twelve hours of flying after such an operation, it's not playable," Eddy Mitchell said.
Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, claiming that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "endigated".
Mr. Camus also said that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, with the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated on a "small colon cancer" and a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his tour of adieux.
But since then, every health problem has been widely commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulties in moving around on stage.
By mid-November, his family even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medallist at the Worlds-2009 in large basin, won an international title on Thursday over a distance that he particularly affectionate, the 50 m free swim, during the Euro-2009 in small basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition, where combinations are last allowed, saw only three world records beat while waiting for a strike.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 nages and the other two by Russia in relay men 4x50 m 4 nages.
A regret for Bousquet, who looked after the world record of the 50 m free, of which he held the brand in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances from swimming, the free 50 m is the 28-year-old Frenchman who imposed himself in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took off against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet preceded the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better, and in the meantime, I had said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed with polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epopia in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not this time serve the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big basin this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer did not succeed in lowering the brand he holds on 400 m of free swim (3:32.77) but nevertheless imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't get involved in this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future," explained Biedermann.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola awarded 1.5 million USD
A panel of Roman sarcophagus that belonged to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded on Thursday 1.5 million dollars, clearly above his estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This sign for two meters long over 63 cm high, dating from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satires and pelvis, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", explained to the AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice-president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's.
He was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still underway, but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers have most auctioned so far, told the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of Emile Zola's acquisition of this marble dates back to a few days.
The panel stayed almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his Parisian private hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister under the Third Republic of France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to the power of the Marshal Pétain.
There was a shadow area of about 50 years left.
By searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this sign was part of a "Emile Zola Succession" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart".
An abortion attempt from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered on Thursday that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied an exception by the putschist government.
For the time being, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not being met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
On Wednesday in Salvador to return Mr. Zelaya, the Mexican government aircraft returned to its original location, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "depart" and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him an exception.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the invited head of state.
The putschist government "has experienced a new failure in wanting me to give up... they wanted me to resign," said Mr. Zelaya on radio Globo, on which he has often expressed himself since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some agreements the fallen president, refugee to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico has applied to us for exception, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum request, said on Wednesday the Minister of Interior of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, on the Honduran radio HRN.
I do not ask for asylum from any country, having answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras should be made as president of the Honduran people, he had stressed.
The original rumors of Mr. Zelaya had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the fallen president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their headquarters.
The Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, criticized the putschist government's position.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he felt.
Zelaya, who had come close to Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, the day on which he held a popular consultation to prepare his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on 21 September and fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out, he will be arrested for the "high betrayal" crime, which the coup is accused of, according to the putschist government.
The President putschist Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but challenged by countries in Latin America such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against the return of Mr. Zelaya to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street climbs, US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with figures from the U.S. trade balance showing the recovery of both the U.S. and its partners: Dow Jones won 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index awarded 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegza, from FTN Financial, said.
But this remains anecdotal, it has tempered, believing that the market is concentrated on "the glass half full".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the US trade balance figures, "which show that activity improves in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
The analysts expected, on the other hand, a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in the volume of trade, especially for exports of goods, which reflects the growth in the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, the new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against expectations last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has declined.
The return on the Treasury bill at 10 years increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday night and the return on the Treasury bill at 30 years to 4.492% compared to 4.408% on the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power consummate the "Ladies in White"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban power conspired on Thursday wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which about ten dissidents were arrested.
Some 40 women in white, wives or close to political prisoners, were being held in the streets by supporters of Raul Castro's government while they were moving to the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, noted a journalist from AFP.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" were scandalous, the fist lifted, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian officers who came "to ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Dames in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Vedado district, about ten dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day, were arrested by police officers in civilian, found a journalist from the AFP.
According to the journalist, the police forced the dissidents in civilian vehicles who were used by government supporters.
Dissident interrogations in similar circumstances generally take only a few hours.
Recipients of the Sakharov 2005 European Parliament Prize, the "White Ladies" had organised an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to the divorce, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda served a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda was a member of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remained under lockdown.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "mercenary" or "agents" on the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Curiously, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "contre-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forced man kills an octogenary to the knife and injures 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed man with two knives killed an octogenaire and injured five more people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at one hour of traffic, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have struck with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an octogenaire, in or before a pharmacy of the 85 Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, was learned from police sources and from witnesses.
The old man, who was born in 1929, according to a police union leader, Alliance, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then took it to a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, aged about 30 years, met and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octagenaire fell asleep.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then made annoyance and was allegedly hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the control of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled to the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have hurt two passersby, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a four-year-old, the latter severe.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he was carrying in cross behind the back, explained on site a head of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to evidence gathered by the AFP, tried to master the force.
I saw a guy about 30 years with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept it.
They didn't get there because the guy was costaud, reported Alberto, a server from a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, at the height of No.61, two municipal police officers, of whom they are responsible, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded with a fist, according to police sources.
The facts have occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passersby came to tell me that there was someone injured outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old on the ground, put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound to the abdomen, told the AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of about 30 years, wounded with knife.
They were National Police personnel who arrested the man without any identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office seized the Departmental Judicial Police Department of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) from the investigation.
The forced man was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out his being interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers had to master him at the Clichy Police Station where he was taken.
It was "in a state of overexcitement" like "all the forces of this species whose forces overlap under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer reiterates demand for the abandonment of prosecution
The lawyer for Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), for the abandonment of prosecutions against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a matter of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianiste", denounced to three judges of the Court of Appeal of the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time of the facts in 1977.
I'm calling for the abandonment of charges here and now," said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge responsible for the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has died since -- would have discussed, before giving his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious lack of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he was "menti" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to give up the prosecutions, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The charge, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, that no abandonment of charges could be seriously studied until Roman Polanski presented himself before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, prior to his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
He's never set foot in the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "should be there to appear at the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "applys for favor to the court, while scorning her authority".
One of the three judges -- who now had 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that there were other alternatives to escape.
Mr. Hummel was not the only one asking for the abandonment of prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer for Samantha Geimer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of prosecutions.
Recalling that her client no longer supports being harassed at every resurgence of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was just.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to his cottage in Gstaad, awaiting a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends up without direction, held back by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction Friday, in a market drawn between better indicators than planned in the United States and the rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, with technological dominance, abandoned 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, raised Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of exchanges has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "contributed to improving market views on the soundness of economic recovery," the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
In addition, US consumer confidence improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been slowed down by a further increase in the dollar, which has been in front of the euro for the last two months, which "slows down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick of the Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has declined.
The return on the Treasury bill at 10 years of age increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening and the return on the Treasury bill at 30 years of age to 4.497% compared to 4.492% on the previous day.
Miss World's election once again in South Africa
After a month of traveling through South Africa, the 112 Miss Monde candidates are preparing to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already picked up their tickets for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sports or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I have seen so many things and experienced so many experiences!, says Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live from Midrand, North Johannesburg, on Saturday from 17h00 (15H00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give up my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice," says Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the Southern summer.
For the young Russians, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "scapes to blow off the breath in this country".
After a month of galas, repetitions, meetings with the press and safaris, the Misses are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow Priyanka Chopra's footsteps, elected in 2000 and presented at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom have become Bollywood stars.
It's the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just a matter of appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, Miss India launches with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
Candidates will perform in traditional costume and, of course, in swimwear.
The show will be animated by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-girlfriend of South African beauty Michelle McLean and a member of the Miss World Steve Douglas committee.
South Africa has shown that it has been able to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that it is difficult to equal, says Julia Morley, President of Miss Monde.
The candidates like last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who held hands on them.
Not common for a Head of State, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the draw in the Cape (southwest) for the World Cup football in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I used to have people I never thought I could approach.
I will undoubtedly come back for the World 2010, is excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport where he had to go to his father's home for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's happening very well," said David Hallyday to the press on his exit from the plane that took him from Paris shortly after 13H00 local (21H00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured him that he was going to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles "very soon", where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a recording hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, so as to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment," the press department said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a disc hernia in Paris on November 26.
The singer had to be repeated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
Her wife, Laeticia, went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade was educated, to attend a school show, found a photographer from the AFP.
The chief of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the hospital of Pitié-Salpetrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on 26 November at the International Clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were upset, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus felt that Johnny Hallyday was "a lot too fast for Los Angeles, with permission from the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me there were no problems with this trip and it surprised me, since I had two discs myself, he added.
Shortly earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "drainless, without anything" after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a sulphur-known physician, sentenced several times by justice, in cases of medical liability, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of the Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" persecuted "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and which is "loin to be recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr.Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Mr.David Koubbi.
It indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well done" and that the post-operation examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not require the installation of a drain", he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems to be in parentheses.
Obviously, a return to the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr Camus.
The UDF association increases tone and sums up the New Centre to stop using its sign
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, responded Friday to the OPA attempt by the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the seal of the former Giscardian party, putting it in no way to use it in any proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to retrieve the UDF seal, believing that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after holding his hand on the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of his efforts, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP who had passed through the NC) who claimed the ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to deposit it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the UDF association's office, controlled by friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to allow themselves to be disposed of, came out of silence to launch a petition to the Minister and the MP, so that they no longer use the seal and transmit the trademark to them, under legal proceedings.
In the last few days, you have multiplied the statements that you are going to propose to your political movement to +remember+ the UDF sign, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You also thought it would be good to follow on your militant material and on your website's guard page, the name of this movement, the +New center+, of the slogan +the UDF today+, also notice the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this sign, explains the UDF office, which continues the NC, "to immediately remove the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to its legitimate owners".
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, warning the signatories.
In their letter, they stated that the UDF "has been a full political movement since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002 to create the UMP".
The new centre therefore has no right to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy) sign.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 its membership of the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, continues the office, "when he filed the mark", he was no longer a "member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He is scandalously and fraudulently taking advantage of the lack of deposit of the UDF acronym to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironising about the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself than to try to get out of the anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which we are not entitled".
Liliane Bettcourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettcourt accuses her, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the Octogenary to strip her of part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of stars, will be sentenced on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter are dissipated while holding the reins of the empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettcourt, 87 years old, should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the terms proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The designated doctors will have to report before March 10, 2010, including whether Liliane Bettelcourt has been able to find herself in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll submit.
I'm going to talk to her about it, said Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, at the end of the hearing.
For his part, counsel for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
It's an excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this old lady that we have to protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettcourt's only daughter has been suing François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist, for years on account of having taken advantage of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros of donations in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master's paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettcourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-standing friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of Ms.Bedetcourt-Meyers' action, lawyers' pleas sometimes turned to the big family unpacking on Friday.
For example, the lawyer for Liliane Bettcourt reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said that she was suspicious of the husband of Françoise Bettcourt-Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettcourt added, according to counsel: "Can you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to her since her marriage."
For her part, Nanterre's prosecutor's office once again considered that the complainant was not eligible to act, especially since a guardianship judge refused in the last few days to allow her application to initiate legal protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettcourt "has full capacity to do justice, it is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managing or ending economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been useless...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large enterprises towards its employees has reminded us of the company's position vis-à-vis consumers prior to the marketing revolution: it is a question of involving employees in "values" determined from above as they used to be, of imposing on consumers products conceived by factory technicians.
By placing the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose unconnected products from customer preference factors comes back regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the result of a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that authoritarian management revenues fully contradict.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the centre of the company's concerns as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls
Internal opinion polls – like Orange's questionnaire to its employees – are they going to incite this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally happens, after many detours, to do as a matter of priority... what it has always done.!
Then, because of authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic vision of human behaviour.
Issued from the great engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old Behaviorist theory, reactivated recently by the "neurosciences" of the United States and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the educational institutes and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible in a way the "lives" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent IPSO survey appeared in Le Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, unadapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, presupposes a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of achieving part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only studies from the motif-based analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their business on the basis of a predetermined dox, which allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them in order to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and restore their human resources management "to the place".
They thus create a ground conducive to the cooperative development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: the "just war" is worth the praises to Obama on the right
The American Right welcomed the speech delivered in Oslo on Friday by Barack Obama, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
This time, the Conservatives, who had issued the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former vice-presidency candidate during the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Mrs. Palin, the right wing of the Republican party, on the daily USA Today, adding that she has addressed the theme of war "sometimes necessary" in her recent memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop these terrorists all over the place, she thought.
Mr. Obama, who inherited from his predecessor George W. Bush's two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, welcomed the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On some sides, I found this all-out historical speech," said Gingrich, interviewed during the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican investment in the 2012 presidential election, was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind the members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former columnist pen of George W. Bush at the Washington Post, Mr. Obama said "a very American speech."
In addition to being a "citizen of the world" like "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a safety bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it", said Mr Gerson.
Among the few on the right to be unconvinced, a falcon from the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN John Bolton, described the speech as "terne, ammoulé and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
On the left of the President, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich warned that Barack Obama would justify the use of force.
When one wraps war in the notion of justice, one can easily justify the massacre of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained logical at the president's place.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel was prematurely attributed to Mr. Obama, described his speech as "superproduction" even as a well-known speaker for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression" lit up California's daily life.
Mr. Obama "declared the speech that needed to be given," said the New York Times, calling it "dark and edifying".
Routiers: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road industry unions and TLF, the only employers' organization to stay to the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended the word of strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "welcomes" this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, the negotiators had left in the early morning of Friday, hoping to sign the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And even if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had closed the door.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting to start at 11 a.m. so everyone would agree and the text would be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "he was afraid that he would disrupt the holidays of the end of years," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
In the hourly rate, for low-wages, "from 8,72 euros to 9,06 euros.
It's not much, but we're going a long way, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we will give orders to our activists that there are no blockades, no blockades of the supply centres.
But we can still have some recalcitrants that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", even though it was "difficult to grant high wage increases in the light of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Doulin (CFTC) praised "an historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to him as "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs by 3%, and for the maintenance of the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address, inter alia, the issue of a 13th month and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employer expenses" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance law for 2009, which was voted by the National Assembly on Thursday to Friday.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same term".
TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply initially to companies that are members of the organization, and secondly, to the entire profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible", Mr. Bussereau assured.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupes market", as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to contradict the turkey eaters of the next awakening, regretted the Unostra.
For Otre, the agreement "risks digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: Disruptions this weekend, dissatisfied unions of RATP proposals
Disruptions on RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday to the 2nd day of a strike between unions and RATP management left them on their hunger for their premium request.
On Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will be trains between 10h00 and 20h00, due to a train on two on the central section (between Defence and Nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which waits for 200,000 customers each day, was pleased that "the RATP is making efforts to serve the major stores".
The RER A through the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
Friday, about one in two trains ran at peak hours, and almost no pick-up in hollow hours, as expected.
As on Thursday, there was no cow on the docks, the Francilians being organized.
In the early morning, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially because of the absence of collegiates and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, explained himself to have risen "one hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive at the hour".
The Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, said SNCF, which had provided for the supervision of law enforcement officers and forces.
The RERs operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare train station to reach the metros.
New general gatherings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged "mighty" by the unions, of a meeting with the management Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RSP proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RSP on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a due premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts forward its parentheses premium proposals, indignant the CGT, stressing that management "was not wrong to solve a problem while road and SNCF are doing it".
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "broader review of the conditions of the profession", the RATP said.
What also made the unions say that the company was "smokin' users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers invaded an establishment committee at headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, who until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "for the sake of relief" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, after the deposit of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
Unions apply for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line in the daily millions of travellers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, are from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros of bonuses, for staggered schedules, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice disbands the pro-Kurd party, a heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court declared on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-eastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the Government's task, which has just been hand-in-hand with the Kurdish community to try to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "foyer of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", said President Hasim Kiliç to the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, whereas a qualified majority of seven votes were required to declare the dissolution, said Mr.Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity granted to Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's property by the Treasure.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a proceedings initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political showcase for the PKK rebels.
The party however ensures that it does not have "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The ruling of the Court intervenes as the government has just handed its hands to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, in order to try to drain the support of the Kurds to the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The DTP leaders had argued that dissolution could lead to an increase in tensions in the south-east of Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerate into conflict with the police in recent weeks.
As soon as the court was announced, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the south is populated by the majority of Kurds.
Order forces fired tear grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators launched molotov cocktails or stones, with frowns.
About 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the court's decision was "to deepen despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurd, ndlr) by banning a party, he said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamic movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented the political analyst Ahmet Island.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
Early snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very tight winter.
But the person in charge of the Road Discharge and Sanding Service (FES) states that it is not to bother citizens.
It is simply so that the officers can test the vehicle technique and learn to master it.
And according to the metalogists, it could be for this week end.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle snow and ice.
The ESF here follows a very detailed plan.
Mr. Brauburger explained that as soon as it began snowing on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures dropped below zero, large sanding vehicles went on 20 main routes (named Routes A).
This includes large traffic streets, major arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloped streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a road melter that adheres well, within 3 hours of maximum time.
This is why the FES service begins at 3 a.m. "to ensure that roads are clear when daily migration begins".
Where it gets harder, it's when snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the person responsible for the cleaning and sanding of roads "because no motorist is willing to let the sanding vehicles pass".
Then, if it is no longer snowing, we are dealing with access roads and service routes - like the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and side streets are the last to come.
Mr. Brauburger knows well that there are still a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the ESF pedestrian team is starting to identify areas and crossings as a matter of priority.
As for cycle tracks, the services of the ESF are generally not able to handle them.
Mr. Brauburger said that Frankfurt had a special service to monitor the state of bridges between 22h and 4h30.
As the glazing is very quickly formed on these surfaces, the sanding vehicles act as soon as the temperature falls below 2 degrees.
This special cash service may also be used by the police.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae looked like other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipede was about 2 meters long for 1.50m high, its posterior limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was filled with sharp and bent teeth, its short arms were finished with flaps and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt reports from the University of Texas to Austin and his colleagues in the Science magazine of Thursday, the Tawa haloae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the emergent lands of the supercontinent, the Pangea and was heading towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of Tawa sheds light on the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, he informs us about the relationship, the distribution and the characteristics of the relationship.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook searches along with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Utah Natural History Museum and member of the excavation team tells them that sometimes they could find a dozen oscillations in a day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories regarding the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named him Tawa after the words of the Hopi Indians for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a very exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery particularly spectacular, but he states that it confirms certain theories regarding the beginnings of dinosaur evolution.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the first dinosaurs.
The experts wondered, among other things, when the saurians were divided into three main groups of evolution: theropods (carnivores) which included tyrannosaur and the later cycleciraptor, from which the birds, the sauropods, quadrupedes to the long neck, and those related to them, and the Ornithisch herbivores of which the species such as triceratops and stegosaur belong.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found evidence that the Tawa haloae had small airbags in its bones at the skull level, as well as birds who are descendants of the theropods.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds relative to mammals.
It appears that in the Tawa haloe, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small airbags in its bones.
Since the relative lineage of the huge sauropods also had air bags and a light bone, it can be assumed that their common forefather already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs in South America lived, the researchers concluded that the Saurians had appeared there.
Therefore, the three major evolution lines have been divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all the emerging lands that formed the Pangee supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the paleontologist team also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advance researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist in Bonn says that there is an even older species, the silencer, which lived in the present Poland and which belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong vision because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while there are virtually none on other continents.
On the other hand, how did dinosaurs manage to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era while they were a relatively rare collateral line in the reptile branch, remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Triassian, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the current crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias the dinosaurs spread throughout the planet thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and Jurassia.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two assumptions.
There may have been a massive extinction to which dinosaurs survived at random when other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or, then, dinosaurs were better adapted and could therefore eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favourite meteorite development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassian period and which since then had been in the shadow: they were mammals.
Vienna Solidarity in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are courses at the University of Naples, Quebec City, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police from the casino of J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt makes waves all over the world.
278 professors and teachers from the University of J.W. Goethe as well as other higher education institutions from Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the Protestant students at Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police sought by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers following a strike after walls and works of art had been covered with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the deterioration did not justify "such violent intervention by the police command against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation represents an unacceptable "attack" to freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism only serves to "delegate and criminalize protest" and tries to make the reasons for mobilization forget.
The University's Steering Committee thus withdrew from the discussions that would be necessary.
Course staff require immediate suspension of criminal proceedings.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the damage.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the services sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Youth Secretary of Verdi.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) , she has made a case for the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and deterioration of the premises is totally unacceptable, she said to the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden last Thursday during the television show Current Hour.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU Member of the Peter Beuth Regional Parliament.
Parliamentary opposition groups, the Greens and the Left (the Left) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the La Left Party (left)
Instead of reflecting on students' arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion to the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
New "Silicon-valley"
For a long time she had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret armament under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216 000 inhabitants at 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important micro- and nanoelectronics production and research sites are located there.
As early as September 2008, Zelenograd representatives established links with Riedberg, a place of French science – with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a “Protocol of Close Cooperation”.
The signatories were the Vice Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the Prefect Anatoly Smiv of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz, project leader for Frankfurt.
In 2010 FIZ representatives and SMEs, whose main focus is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in an expanding state.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
The Institute of Electrotechnics of Moscow, the major companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika are located here.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist town" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") draws its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The size of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be sufficiently high.
For his supporters it is nothing less than "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the landfill of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge into the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, in a desperate chaos of constructions for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the spirit of the 1980s.
The line-head stations, with roads ending in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th-century transport technique that had the effect of braking the modern rail traffic because it took a lot of time to move the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what you have to do.
That's why line-head stations have to disappear: Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Magistrale of the rail between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer long compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, line-head stations no longer really pose entry and exit problems since modern, reversible trains with car rails and car-pilot at both ends exist.
However, the realization of Stuttgart 21 is now launched next to the new route from the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and local policies have taken it.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who costs the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public company.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the extension of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge increase was attributed.
At that time there was not yet competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening the traffic of goods as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new plot, with its inclinations, is not suitable for trains of goods.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of junction and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport contains a total of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the expansion of the section through the Rhine valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built slowly.
It would be very urgent to support the mushroom here in depth.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake sabotage.
The Rhine Valley route is on its way to becoming the bottleneck for the traffic of international goods, which is at the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appeal to the Hesse Administrative Tribunal's judgment concerning the prohibition of night air flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had entrusted experts with legal review of the Administrative Tribunal's judgment, which is a document with more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the night flight ban regulations in the event of or the proposed construction of the north-west landing runway at Frankfurt Airport would take place.
The authorization to land for 17 aircraft between 11 and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided for 4 January if it wishes to appeal against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticises this deadline and tries to put pressure on the representative of the government for the latter to refer the matter to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which consisted of prohibiting night flights. Otherwise, it will be treated as a total failure to a given word.
It is most difficult to be allowed to hold his speech," said the Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's electoral slogan "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch rejects Schäfer-Gümbel's accusations that the Land government is still trying to allow night flights by using "avocaserie and rublardises".
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "fast first impression".
The decision must be legally sound, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of the statements made by its fraction on night flight bans is completely erratic.
U.S. banks repay the grant
The large American banks, very affected by the crisis, defend themselves from their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid the Treasury $45 billion (more than €30 billion), corresponding to the assistance provided under the Tarp Rescue Plan.
The U.S. television channel NBC reported that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
In this way, banking institutions seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers and the higher payment of fees.
The Bank of America has launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors, which has brought it 19 billion dollars of fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's funds, which are well filled through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the Bank of America's Director General, specifically called on American taxpayers to thank him: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by buying the Merrill Lynch investment bank at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also considering obtaining money in financial markets in order to free itself from State guardianship.
As a result, the US bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase on Thursday, reported the NBC chain citing the banking community.
The Citigroup spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid back their public funds.
Accelerated election
After all, everything went faster than planned.
Just two weeks after the current position of editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German ZDF chain, the successor has already been appointed.
The committee wished to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin editorial of ZDF, was the big favourite.
The chain, however, did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a willingness not to further harm the ZDF's commander Markus Schächter if the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors that Nikolaus Brender's contract be extended by five years, but that had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council expressed their support for the reintroduction of Brender and 7 others had voted against it. Brender's dismissal represented a good than foreseeable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already been heard several weeks before the vote, and did not wish to renew Brender's position.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly regarded editor-in-chief by claiming that the listening rate for the ZDF's information programs had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, with the increasing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end there were even 35 experts in public law who had become involved in the debate and who felt that the way Koch was acting was unconstitutional.
But it won't have served anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and novel languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rhenania-Palatinat radio organ) and at the Frankfurter Rundschau (German national quota).
In 1983 he became editor within the ZDF first of all at the news magazine "huute-journal" (journal today).
Then his journey continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/92, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bimonthly news program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin drafting department.
After Brender's disgrâce, when he had just been elected a journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhenania-Palatinat Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the instigator's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF Monitoring Commissions.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had been able to work with the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission with vehementness in his decision to limoger Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the editor-in-chief position without losing sight of it, as well as the Board of Directors could elect it without the courage to place a political supporter in the position.
In the arithmetical performances of the parties, Frey is ranked Liberal left-wing.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to show more conciliatoryness: at a meeting between the Ministers and delegates of the Rectors Conference, an agreement was developed that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to finish their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of examinations: a single examination should enable the chosen study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload should be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed themselves to introducing more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor's and Master's courses.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulations between countries.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have always in the mouth the expression "educability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of examinations: "Each module must normally be able to be completed by a single examination", can be read in a document of about 30 pages on future admission conditions to university courses.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, stated that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop the loopholes, which significantly damaged the studyability.
In addition, "educability" should be the decisive criterion in the organisation of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the bottom must be carefully examined to see if one cannot avoid this feeling of suffocation that one sometimes feels in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition considers that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and flexibility to enable and promote personal initiative".
The new regulation will concern access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing ones.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every five years, which means, however, that only in 2015 will all cycles be examined.
There are 10 relevant accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation councils created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put pressure on the Länder to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes were not too busy and the review regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
so far, the only Land that has given its agreement to give more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutoring programs to strengthen educational guidance offices, review offices and the International Relations Service.
The Länder and universities have a budget of EUR 10 million for this.
In early 2010, the government wants to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institution Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one examination will be required to complete his studies.
The organization of studies should be more flexible and recognition of notes from other higher education institutions should be guaranteed and access to the Master's degree should be simplified.
By the end of next year, the studyability of all university courses will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the question of the conditions of study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said he would like to see the organization of educational policy no longer take place in the future "behind closed doors" of the ministers and rectors of universities.
Not later than after the educational strike, students as concerned should be able to express themselves a little.
Future graduates of higher education were supported by the President of the Representatives of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful to us," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Union of Education and Science (GEW) the decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. He demands the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduate to register for a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also requests that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students will have enough places for master's studies and study conditions as well as possible tomorrow.
The Länder must therefore hire more instructors.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master's degree.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "arriving in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work by poet Werner Söllner, in which he themes in bits of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his language territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently director of the collection in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received several literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum of Hesse at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror deforming your Securitas files".
Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the security police.
Söllner received the German language award in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The recruitment tests had started iniquitously in 1971.
I am, Söllner concludes "so someone who has not been able to resist enough intimidation attempts of the Securitas."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informer Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honor of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its exemplary literary demise with the mechanisms of the power of dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly shows the downfall and the downfall of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own case, IM Walter played a role, provided the specialist in literature Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favour.
"He had been able to pull him out of all the difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before that public was unexpected, however, the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with Romanian secret services is not, in fact, so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the Securitas spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after having read the 914 pages of its own file.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculations and sometimes have guessed which real names have hidden the last names of Sorin, Voicu, and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the files of the Stasi is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitas file is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been constantly counterbalanced and hindered in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council of the Birthler Institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Secured Archives (CNSAS) but the restitution of files has been rather slow since then.
There has been a law since 2005 that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitas in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former Head of the Securitas of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way about the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and at the end of the day she was only interviewed once.
The infamy of power thought it possible to express itself here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many of the inescapable issues are associated with the Söllner case as it happens so often in a hidden guilt context.
Why now? Who has been spolished? The weighted reaction of the listeners, to Söllner's admission, suggests that the follow-up to this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, this is more than a footnote.
Crowds at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative came here, drawn from four pins coming straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sportsman had spread his goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross mounted at midnight less the quarter in a Mercedes Class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier at hand.
The man, whose head was bold, drew attention, let himself be led into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our quinquagenar could have taken the wheel himself – he had not drank alcohol and he was not drunk with happiness either.
He had spent a pleasant evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because it's now that it's going to start.
The Swiss words we had just entered into three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final", that is to say in the league of the champions thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal battle not to fall back".
The "big job" awaits us Sunday.
This is to repeat in Mainz the results of the league of champions on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three sending goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawer by lot
The 8th final of the Champions League (match to go 16/17. + 23/24 February/ game back 9/10. + 16/17. March) will be released on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of entering the fulminant function of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And joy was not moderate only among those who had been lucky, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, an unfailing motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I was seen by the players and told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more brave, explained the "souls' plumber" – Gross – the recipe for success that sounded so good that no longer had any effect with the caretaker Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, avoua Jens Lehmann - a supporter of Babbel -, "in the foot when there is a new impulse things sometimes happen that we would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the rank of best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "event" observed by a "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "It is someone who is going to act and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warned manager Horst Heldt
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart needs tenacity.
Just like Gross, players and the manager are careful to overestimate the victory against a completely outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0:4 , objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We have not yet passed through the difficult road.
That Heldt did not have the heart to celebrate on the day of his 40th birthday, even after the first home win for three months, is from the weekend events that a television interview of goaltender Jens Lehmann made back just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, contradicted Heldt, in response to Lehmann's acerb criticism.
He had accused the direction of weak style and said she had decided to change the coach under the pressure of puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after the games had been removed from him.
Lehmann's statements were "marked with pure selfishness" down Heldt and announced consequences for the goaltender.
They could no longer become friends for life these two quadragenaires.
In any case, they agreed with the rest, that is to say, without the advance work of the group by the replacement coach, the strong sporting and combat representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "largely successful" retorted Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man with the plastic bag acquired.
Heavyweight World Championship
Warm fight in Berne: Kevin Johnson constantly caused the challenger verbally and verbally the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve tough rounds the Ukrainian defended his title as a heavyweight world champion according to the version of the WBC Federation.
He acted unanimously on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko holds his title as a heavy goods vehicle world champion.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a single-point victory against American judges Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has defended his title with honour since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the World Championship of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the KO so much expected.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional battles, has twice his defeat due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In the Bernese arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the battle, from the top of his 2.02 meters, by his opposite left.
Johnson, eleven centimetres smaller, who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, succeeded in avoiding the champion's blows, thus impeding Klitschko to get into play with his evil right.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried mainly to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows very rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having crossed the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko the "wrong zombie" who "is not really capable".
During Friday's weighing, the champion could not prevent Johnson from causing him to drop his sunglasses from the nose "in order to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko has imposed himself again during his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "sa" belt WBC that he had previously abandoned without fighting.
This year, defending his title as a champion, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a shot at this fight and I'm in perfect shape," said Klitschko to explain his quick return to the ring.
Its highlight is trying to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Vladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko which was scheduled to take place in September.
It would appear that his promotional company is now considering playing this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
Kunduz case
Frontal opposition attack: the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz case.
The SPD and La Gauche (the Left) parties ask the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After considering the latest information on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition denounced the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) for deliberately dissimulating certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a counterfeit" on the murderous strike of two tank trucks last September, said the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 8 p.m.).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given total disregard for the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is, in essence, the content of the NATO report, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the purpose of the strike was in reality, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured in the U.S. air attack that was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to make a statement to the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and her colleague from the Green Party of the Renate Künast are of the opinion that Ms. Angela Merkel must state clearly whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the government's Afghan policy if the chancellery, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The spokesman for the Government categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellor has in no way influenced the military's intervention in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, more and more voices were voiced to express doubts about the real reasons for the return of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Guttenberg regarding the attack on tank trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hid some embarrassing details from the Minister.
In the vicinity of the two senior officials, however, it is suggested that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have asked for a clarification of the facts in a letter in the meantime.
So far, no response has been received.
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these accusations and referred the matter to the federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which was to be formed on the following Wednesday in order to shed light on the facts.
The Worlds of Dream
Some people see images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in mental patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest during sleep, everything is fine.
When we are lying in our dormant rooms, we can give ourselves free of obstacles to the most crazy dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who wakes up experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, has a reputation in our Western world to be crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in mental patients or under the effect of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at issue: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but which sometimes induces the limits between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect are different, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
Hallucinations or delicacy occur when the balance, neurotransmitter substances of the brain - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the various parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts often manifest themselves during schizophrenic psychosis.
Earth's attraction power no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always considered the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, the hallucinations were a form of dream-awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delicacy and sensory illusions that compose it".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a cartoon character.
Its body is in two dimensions with crystal colours.
The land attraction no longer has power over it, it floats at the rail of the ceiling.
He's feeling a little bit.
Behind him are the creatures of the devil winged, grimling, singing mouth, showing the teeth.
They pursue him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over the body.
Violent, wicked, shouting voices, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult him and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from its stereo chain, making it a loop and fastening it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a wand and passes the loop around the neck.
He's jumping.
The loop's unlocking.
Let this serve you as a lesson, shouting voices in a choir to rip off the tympan. "Go to a clinic and get well!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
Diagnosis: schizophrenia-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition, it is maniac-depressive, it takes medicines for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis, I lived through terrible fears and deep despairs.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their life; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make a difference between the internal and the external world, they find themselves in a state of hyperexcitement, which means that they can suffer hallucinations, megalomania, relations madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Just like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasy from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry of Heidelberg (General Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
Schizophrene is at the centre of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time it finds itself in a passive role, it is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That's why schizophrenia often feels threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, to wake up is excluded.
Experience once in his lifetime of hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
Deciding thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the living takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain do this kind of cabrioles, is always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to lose the perception of reality momentarily, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers assume that the individuals concerned have minor brain damage.
It is assumed that the brain's neuronal ripening is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example through a mother's viral infection during pregnancy, says Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which the abnormality of the neuronal system occurs and the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can trigger psychosis, if there is predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats.
What's crazy is what Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck tells us is that the psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports for ten years on hallucinations and phenomena of illusional images: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Real World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are often part of the concurrent phenomena typical of psychosis but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies.
Mental disorders such as borderline or depression, as well as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma are among these.
It is surprising to note that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently repressed; when our brain heats but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulation, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, a third of participants acknowledged that they had experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in the former Mecklenburg-Pomerania and goes to high school.
A young girl to do all she can to tell the truth.
If there were no pictures and voices.
During recreation, a young boy, slim, with long hat hair, sometimes speaks to him.
When she responds to her comrades looking at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this young friend.
Am I crazy?
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
Often the visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to attend the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is clearly explaining equations to the table.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that happens too rarely and too late, she can often not make a distinction if she is awake or dreaming already, if the images she sees, the grim faces or the young girl with bloodthirsty entrails on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, call on these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it either to her parents or to her friends, they would take it crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She had her bag last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she came into contact with psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Crazy is also an art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the likelihood is high that they will have hallucinations after a certain time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, makes sure there's animation.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was in the age of thinking, was not her true father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Each experience", according to Kasten " takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasy is not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a special talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness we have unfortunately a tendency to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and doctor head of the psychiatric clinic and psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but which also contains something positive, of creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of oniroid experience, a particular form of changing the consciousness awakened by the dream.
The oniroids are very complex semi-deserts that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The state of oniroid consciousness manifests during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as in patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is separated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
This is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an unbearable situation in itself, an organisational capacity that is given to us men so as not to gloomy in the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
The Zurichese Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as a saving action of the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time when his conscious share for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in reanimation.
Claussen dives into a world he has created of all the rooms, visit foreign places, travel in time. He sees himself in old manhood in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his head looking after his health.
He lives at an average age among nobles who manufacture blood-based narcotics.
He is taken by a motorcycle Greek who takes him to his country, he surfes with his hospital bed in the Neve of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It absorbs completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes by describing what he has lived.
In contrast to dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It may even be said that they are much more distinct and intense than the real life.
The intensity of this experience breaks out the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oniroid delicacy, psychosis, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of outer reality are even in a state of watchfulness.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
Early snow can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will follow the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment as CEO of the Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to return to the press group, he said to the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, publisher Hubert Burda sees his society in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 and are firmly committed to integrating society," said Hubert Burda, 69 years old, in Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
We also need to see if they are capable of doing so.
It is not possible to impose on 7500 employees their children without knowing whether they have the capacity to deal with them.
This would destroy the children as well as the business.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the position of President-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was initially responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently, he occupied the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family who is in charge of the Burda editions.
The children of Burda are 19 and 17 years old, respectively, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's nomination is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda states that holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families who have been trained by a capital boom, who have made huge speculations unfortunate thinking that they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power," said Burda.
I absolutely do not see myself in the role of the country's preacher as might be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues such as Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Full beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at hand.
This is the objective set by El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
On the eighth floor, the spa is home to prestigious brands such as Hedonai, a specialist in laser epilation, Spaxion, with its relaxation and aesthetic treatments rooms, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a radii of food, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views on the capital, or to rent the relax area for two hours to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax with a Jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a champagne cup.
A total of 250 m2 are divided into 12 rooms, where you can enjoy the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
For example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
Everything starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touchscreen, located opposite the device.
Several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
The director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are sufficient to work all the muscles of the body.
And if after having done our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the teacher Luis & Tachi has a room where we propose rituals for repairing the hair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the key words of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10 am to 10 pm.
Various decompositions
Christmas approaches and it is never unnecessary to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the cleavage, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to consider.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated cleavage. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, get away from the electric car
The electrical company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento in Barcelona, created the "Oficina LIVE".
It is a project to develop and promote electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Electrical Vehicle Installation) will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will set up mobility agreements, taking steps, coordinating, providing subsidies, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The electrical company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa is involved in promoting electric cars.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a range of complementary projects such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero enters “a future of peace” for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, is undertaking "a future of peace" for the Spanish car industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
At the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the Executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we would now have a landscape for abandoning, closing down some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a highly competitive sector, we can consider a future of peace for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integrated Car Sector Plan (IPA), has committed €800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilised an investment of more than €3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, in reference to the 2000E Plan, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, the plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a "high increase" in registrations, which increased by "40%" in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Fair of Collection Cars, a meeting space for motorists and enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabloón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
They are an exposure area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find motorcycles and car collections, but you can also find products related to the engine world at ClassicAuto Madrid.
For example, at the flag exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles linked to the world of the engine of collection that will make collectors and strangers happy.
Among the participating companies we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External fitness test
But the trade activity of this trade fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sporting exhibitions, skills tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with automobiles and collecting motorcycles will also be carried out on a circuit outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A Sustainable Sporting Spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sport mind is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, named i-Stop, a device which, at least for the moment, is available only on the 150-horse engine 2.0.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by its overall good score.
Details, vehicle finishing, habitability, behavior, mechanical, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
Touching the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
By continuing with the set formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as vibrant colours in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That's why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Gulf, which everyone wants to overtake.
By continuing with the passenger compartment, this compact Japanese car has more than enough accommodation to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Adds to all this a large trunk to regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available on the petrol engine of two litres and 150 horses and with manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not carry out a large number of kilometres a year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, i.e. the one with the largest number of serial elements.
Amongst the standard equipment, the Track Change Assistant (RVM) that removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed regulator, the photosensitive inner mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and bluetooth audio, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes elements of bi-xenon adaptable light bulbs and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is illustrated in particular by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not carry out many kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 2.0 petrol engine of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23 270 euros for the Sportive model tested.
In return for this large sum, Mazda3 will offer us a large daily dose of satisfaction.
"First" luxury
L.A. covers the red sensual carpet embodied by Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever brightened us, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the exit of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a "male lady".
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to watch its e-mail, without offering the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is harder to see him in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and a very low monthly subscription, less than half of what e.g. costs the iPhone's data subscription.
In view of its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is just as limited as his American grandfather, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, approximately 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with a Smartphone already know what is the fact of giving up data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a connection from Fon) to be able to consult their mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and it's been a long time since it should work.
Some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated calls from the European Commission to propose affordable roaming tariffs throughout Europe have hardly had any tangible effect.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it's always curious that it's called Fon while it doesn't have the Wifi) offers these types of rates, means that operators start thinking differently and study various proposals that allow them to make their data network more profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no charge.
This is a connected device and you pay when you purchase it and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: an option to buy with access to life as Peek already proposes in the United States.
No, I don't want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just wish for it because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The favorite color of Michelle
Yellow is probably the preferred color for the first lady in the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's office as President of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, she chose the same to accompany him at the second moment, no doubt the most important of her life: giving Oslo the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: in addition to their similar colour, a yellow drawing green with bright reflections, twice, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So that at first glance, it would seem that the first lady in the United States follows the lineup of the Princess of Asturias and chose to return the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the taking of office it was a thick lace, on the other hand, it carried a printed velvet to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: from green to medium heel shoes for the first occasion, and a similar, but golden model, this time.
Hairstyle also changed: the hair is now raised while it was wearing it the previous time.
75 % of working mothers have had professional problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "Fécondity and career of women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer reveals.
The survey, conducted out of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers saw their professional careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in couples and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of employment.
Those who do not have activity outside the home, work part-time or have little stable work, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are pushed back into life as a couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after joining a couple. This figure increases to 4.1 for those working in the public sector."These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to obtain it, which led them to push back the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised greatly influences maternity, but less the date of common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those with elementary and higher education were mothers on average for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years of age.
"Another division also appears among women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher level studies invert this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," said Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors : Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will incarnate the image of several products of the brand, amazing the universal motto "Because I do well".
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, thus joins other celebrities at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club so selected were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
Among men, the brand of cosmetics also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, Lessons of Anatomy) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Gospel in Lost).
UK fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and mannequins, yesterday and today, met for the annual award of their prize, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed the date.
The ex-mannequin Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best mannequin of the year.
The poker of the ace of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de aces (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographs" of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
He doesn't do it according to the predictable and perceived genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the core of the character created.
The journey is exciting and Vincent saves neither the sprayers nor the illuminations.
Enjoyment, this book is also a moving invitation to readings and readings.
I'll leave you here a few instants.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, pulse, even that which I felt without calling it: the pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, without meaning, as the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman by a passion that lasted thirteen years, in which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of loss."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which has to be engraved by the north side, on which the best mountaineers are still letting go."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange guy.
From himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the cry pushed from a bridge by this Munch character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he made it in the flight of himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the biscuits."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled and prayed: "God-loved, I beg you to stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spencer: "The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the life, tired death nourishes."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told him that Edward VII was cutting him between the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
We have never seen a man as patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent went beyond madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it is not to try to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What if it's not Faulkner's shooting Baroja?
What did this do if it is not to aspirate the glory of this man so that he may serve him as a pedestrian?"
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, was walking in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed next to her and our dog, a blood-melt, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they hit her with two blows that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we don't see what fun it is to attack a little defenseless animal free of charge that was left behind.
Add to that the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, managed to fear for her physical integrity, since an energumen who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an elderly person or, ultimately, anyone weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5:00 a.m., one Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog was groaning all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint at the local police station, even though we doubt that it serves a great deal and in order not to touch the sensitivity, we just want to make it clear that the cowards were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening with young people so that they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal free of charge that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people went.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the helmet port
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet, mainly among the youngest motorcycles, as indicated today by the two structures.
The objective of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of increasingly safe products" and stated that it contributed to this goal by other educational and informative actions.
This new two-wheel helmet promotion campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly safe products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6 per cent over 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to the figures of the employer union of the Anfac and Ganvam manufacturers, that of the dealers.
However, the good news should be made clear, since the reference used for comparison, in November 2008, was particularly poor, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the resurgence of last month, registrations accumulated during those 11 months are 40% below those in the previous fiscal year.
Since January, 95 853 have been sold if all vehicles that are included in the category of light commercial vehicles (cars, pick-ups, vans, vans and light chassis trucks) have been added to the list.
The large clouds that most affect their demand did not dissipate, as, although they are also bought by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
In addition to the restrictions on bank loans, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation need to be added.
In view of this situation and of the difference between tourism vehicles, aid for purchasing the 2000E was scarcely used.
Apart from individuals, independents and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, Ganvam reiterated the need for administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (cams and buses).
The concessionaire association plans a 2010 year similar to the one that ends, for which it calculates a 19 % drop in sales (for tourism vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As has been done with the anti-lock system for ABS brakes and as will be done with the ESP stability control, emergency braking systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
Moreover, they are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a deficit period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen pedestrian protection, although, by its way of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system by the driver's step.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident could not support the brake before the collision, and half of them did not benefit from its full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The aid intervention, revancha, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularity of so-called emergency braking intelligent systems: it is estimated that one in four disaster with injured people would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to radar or camera, detects the obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage.
General Motors pushes back to January plan for Opel
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that he would need more time to complete the Opel relief plan.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, means that each item of the plan was first approved by the party concerned.
This may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which the factories are located, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made within the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows to be in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspire to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, supported by the Russian group Converg, is of importance.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and most valuable jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to reduce it by just less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to move, in the first place, from the automatic roof which was replaced by a hand-cuffed roof, reducing by 21 kilos, using aluminium doors such as those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, removing the air conditioner, 13 kilos, reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of won, mounting sports bags, another 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, winning another six kilograms and replacing door handles with tissue handles, saving the remaining one kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-embracing PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual-box model, mainly on roads in the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous bends.
Its behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The weight loss does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with a pedestal.
On the contrary, it had been a long time since we had not tested such a small and lightweight model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in the curves, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, capable of heating his muscles at small speed for the time required, until we asked him to sprinkle, brake, recover and push his engine again...
That's out of what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is, the car will do what our hands will say on the wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
His engine at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the option "sport" or thanks to a system that changes the engine friction, already used on the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at a stop or during recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road surface we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
Electronic assistants barely made attendance on the whole journey, while on some bends we found ice in the early morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Finally, an ultra-light car, the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.
« Bag Girl »
Karl Lagerfeld's intimate friend, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer shows her face as bad girl with as much content as her Chanel bags.
More than a "bad girl" or a "it girl," it's a "bag girl".
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral obtained a triumphant in 91-82 during his visit to the arduous terrain of the Maccabi Electro, despite the numerous absences suffered by the Dusko Ivanovic team. It is thus at the head of his group, after Mirza Teletovic's great show, which, with eight three-point baskets, was the best of his team (29 reviews).
Vitoria's team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mikov with a large dose of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets marked, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, who took advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped into the Israeli field with the warm wrists.
Français and Teletovic were the leading artisans of the 18-20 final quarter.
The second quarter-time was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by acclamations and applause back to his old house, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to see himself as the best player in his team, with 13 points marked, although Splitter's "less than six" rating already suggested that this night was not going to be the best Brazilian.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played far from there, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria that they didn't win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand," they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini make a decisive contribution to the bright advantage of yellow (50-49).
Other Difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from being dead, needed to chain up some good actions to take the air, and it was at that time that the Mirza Teletovic machine gun came out, which, with three consecutive three-point baskets and the help of English and Ribas, gave the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and that the premises managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play it all for the last period and Français and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they would not let anyone take what they deserved for the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the line of the three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fault, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended themselves well, and although the Israelis came close at the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The injuries prevent Unicaja from delivering battle
The Unicaja lost silently in Greece in the face of the Olympic Games and handed over to him the head of Group B of Euroligue, in a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or by the scale of the rivalry, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter of the time allowed the Andalusian to dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who blew up the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympic Games were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team arsenal with the internal game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to overthrow the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a beginning of a fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing its superiority in both camps, while the release for injury of the English pin Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
Internal players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, gained advantage 44-32, at 19th minute.
It's impossible to climb up.
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympic Games, which, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to equalize the difference in the encounter at Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, which made the group's head lucky.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57 at the thirty-first minute.
But victory was almost impossible because the Olympic Games proved implacable when the players pressed and demonstrated their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja sat down, accepting the victory of the Olympic Games.
How much should you be paid on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would earn according to their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate ads, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The tool "How much should you be paid?" calculates the salaries of users from more than 140,000 job vacancies available in Trovit, Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, years of experience, age and city where you want to work.
For a week since the application works, the search engine has detected that, as a general rule, the Spanish worker feels "malpaid", explained in a press release the head of Trovit products, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives €45,226 gross annuals and a Frenchman, €31,059, while a Spanishman receives €24,000.
Similarly, one driver collects EUR 34,247 gross per year in England, EUR 25,751 in France and EUR 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid work in Spain is that of a server, with EUR 11,592 per year, followed by that of a seller, EUR 14,725 and that of a worker, with EUR 15,667.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of drivers, mid-term jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrow of the President shall abandon the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, Business Officer of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, he must look for another destination."
The channel also cited the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline set: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by phone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on her.
Thank you very much.
After days of rose since last spring, in which the inflation of the assets constituted the dominant mark on the markets, the uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising as it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future by an uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to raise debt through the purchase of direct assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without challenging their non-conformity of liquidity policy, are beginning to put a little sand in the works, as the ECB has done, with their bid to one year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we are in the process of helping to reverse the reduction in risk premiums.
The volatility of stock exchanges and the variances in corporate bonds are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the havens chosen by investors, provoking an increase in differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened with a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the moral risk defenders, who tried again to create a case of awareness among those responsible for world economic policy who had hindered the destructive effects of credit limitation on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is a new day of grace action.
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and has made its citizens jointly responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardization of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our public debt gaps increase to the extent of the obligations of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If the European gaps were to decrease and ours were to continue to increase, this would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators oblige most study services to anticipate their recovery models and to increase their forecast for 2011, in addition to the OECD and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not give much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment "prudentness is a mother of overrepresentation".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the Sub-Committee of the Congress of Members, where the Spanish energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his intervention, followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched out to the press what he had said in front of the sub-commission, at eight closes.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million until 2020 and an additional 60 000 million between that date and 2030, in the event that the nuclear power plants today remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60 000 million, but 95 000.
However, Iberdola believes that for the next decade investment should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change, and power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses both on gas and coal plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what its company is demanding, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
According to him, there is a "clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "partial" measures, as the President of Iberdrola described them.
In any event, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although located on the long term, must start to be taken, as they take some time to reach maturity and that a stable income framework is necessary to tackle them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus handling market at 10 airports
Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the privileged role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Centre for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures.
The alliance foresees an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona contests its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which she is already working as an energy and water company.
The project is estimated at $1,700 million (approximately €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a public works firm and dealer of highways.
The City Hall wishes to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to $1,700 million (about €1,047 million) and in the final phase three consortia are facing, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the world, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest manufacturers, while the second, located in Italy, is one of the largest European underground specialists.
The Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield Infrastructure Manager and the French manufacturer group Bouygues, is taking a stand against Acciona's team.
The third and last consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the galloise company specialized in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatizations, but entering them is a great difficulty, except through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by the already mentioned Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has barely acquired a seat on this market by its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Assets millionaires
Acciona is based on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a large presence through its energy supplier activity and in the disalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and is responsible for the consolidation of companies to construct and manage Adelaide's diesel engine, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter infrastructure construction and management markets.
The tolled underground road, promoted by the Office of Infrastructure of the City of Brisbane and the said Northern Link (north link), is called to connect the western highway of Toowong to the peripheral road in Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll route will be open at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed by 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include twice as many tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute US$500 million (EUR308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to grow significantly, which mentioned yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local Leighton subsidiary, the infrastructure of the national fibre broadband network.
This intervention will allow 400 000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has handed over the construction project of the 27-storey King George Tower in the city of Brisbane. The works have not yet begun and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is awarded EUR 64.5 million for the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia.
The company obtained this contract a few days after it saw work on the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the project is planned for early 2010 and its completion will take 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore is awarded advertising of Renfe
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the Sra agency. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, indicated the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that presented themselves at Renfe's tender, four of which were finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to curb competition
The French regulator of competition imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator restricted competition on fixed and mobile telephones by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company, has accumulated more than EUR 450 million in fines since 1994, because of its obstacles to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has also been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recidivized.
An application shop
On the other hand, the French company's mobile phone subsidiary followed the siltation of other operators and opened an Internet application shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from the transmission of voice.
The Orange application shop will initially be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to be expected in 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the League of Champions has been 476.4 million in Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The League of Champions has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, placing them in the third and fifth positions of clubs that took the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
In fact, the competition allocated €5 362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) who have participated in the event since the start of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served in this distribution.
The White Club was the third of the continent to reach the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are the Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams who, in addition, billed the most money for their participation in the last League of Champions.
And that, although they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the League of Champions, although it won more titles than any other (five, while Italy won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is due to the complex money allocation procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1 090 million thanks to the League of Champions.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in more than 550 00 euros for each fight.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those arriving in eighth finals receive three million each, the eight teams arriving in quarter finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For example, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça caught 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are committed.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attractive places.
The previous year's champion will charge 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third, and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday listed the details of the offer to buy shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a Public Procurement Offer (PA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
Yesterday, Sos' shares closed at 1.85 euros, and Nueva Rumasa's offer therefore evaluates the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
CNMV has assured not to have been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company stated that it had contacted the regulator.
If so, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos' capital is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues the restructuring of its management.
In an attempt to stay outside of any offers of purchase and of the law and comes from her former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Internal Audit Director.
A decision that makes it the first woman to hold a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the Group president.
And it is not free from polemics, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the supposed diversion of more than 230 million Sos to the Salazar societies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the next few months Sos will reveal further misappropriations of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding credit to Salazar, former advisors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM representatives and Unicaja representatives) said yesterday before the National Hearing that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paterina's exclusion OPA submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (NCMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paterina on 9 October.
The Authority explained that it authorized this operation as it understood that its terms were aligned with the standards in force and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet presented to be "sufficient" as a result of the amendments applied on December 2nd.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paterina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, representing 8.95 % of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized, and that they could not be transmitted in any way prior to the finalisation of the offer, which he indicated had been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the provisions of the existing standards.
New car expertise tools
In those days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex work.
Calculate the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labour can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of experts use such systems.
Service providers and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, and then process them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the area of evaluation tools and in the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Managing Director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that over the past five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies start working.
This is a very hard work, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be catalogued and the price entered.
In addition, a "intelligent" graphic image of each model can be clicked on the different parts of a tourist car.
If this is a massively sold model, the work can be done within a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If a car is not sold, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they include, for example, information on Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure is over 99 per cent.
To carry out documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centres around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million a year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to propose various products.
The most common application relates to repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the handling of parts of a car or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide to the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting scales.
This tool is purchased according to its usage, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for low-user customers, up to a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the complete identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on the glasses of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the professional sector on the Internet, which allows you to bid on vehicles declared to be wrecked.
Its statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geo-demographic analyses or familiarizing with common problems by brand or model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a failure or how many serious claims were suffered for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of such tools.
It sells, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and time.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, failures or maintenance of vehicles.
The assessment guide GT is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its volume of business has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, with a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she started her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% is in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The Solera Group's global business figure (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3 per cent more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive €19.1 million, or 7.2 per cent more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on a stock exchange of $1,000 million, and today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, he has been a member of the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auctions of car accidents
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million per 85% of the company's capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with access to a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cassettes and professional sellers who must be registered before they begin operations.
This platform was established in Germany in 1996 and operates more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, including 500,000 operations in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer operate, but, on the other hand, certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Four-step garage quote
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the spare part, creating a quote and generating it.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism vehicles, 109 all-terrains, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, for use, a computer and Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired is identified with its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the required piece is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, increases or reductions, then he can print the quote to give it back to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
At present, the company Audatex is working to make these images in three dimensions.
It is an innovation that mechanics see from a very good eye, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and make it turn to see the internal face.
