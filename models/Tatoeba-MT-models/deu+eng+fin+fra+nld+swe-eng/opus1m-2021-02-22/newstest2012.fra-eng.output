Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, in the context of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph on the conviction of Julia Tymoshenko, the leader of the opposition.
The MPs refused at second reading the draft amendment aimed at reducing the penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the currently imprisoned former Prime Minister.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to 7 years in prison in October for having reached a pre-distinctive agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymoshenko describes the judgement of political vengeance of the regime and has caused a process of suspicion of bias of the court also to the west.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 members of parliament.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victoire
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already defeated them.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners are still to be determined.
As it is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are Islamists, but they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary right of Sharia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a robbery you cut your hand.
Women may forget the emancipation, if they do not respect the faith, they are subject to the death penalty...
It is the Qur'an that will unite instead of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya such an order will reign as we cannot represent it and as we would surely not like it.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not be advantageous to Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted aid with the recognition of disloyal dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who led NATO strikes, but rather Allah, of whom they celebrated the greatness of each attack.
When it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our political leaders turned away from the dictator as a political alliance without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
There is therefore no problem for the premises to get rid of the "cross-crosses".
Without land use, oil companies will easily have access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not as much and the West could ultimately boast of the protection of the human rights concerned.
Unless we stop those followers of the sharia.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in search of investors.
A statistical tornado went on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the statements published information relating to GDP for the 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats all records.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is forecast to grow by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter, where Germany was better placed than expected (0.3% increase instead of 0.1%) but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was a matter of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated, and according to the Czech Statistical Office, it is confirmed that progress is being made towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy grew by 0.5% according to the forecasted and periodically recalculated data.
The euro area and European Union economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which was the case for analysts.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year rate of return on bonds is 28.45%
The yields of the obligations of Spain and Italy are increasing to critical limits.
The problems start to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4% while the situation in the region is worsening.
Voices were heard in Germany saying that the ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The representation of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to Super Cech and Guardian Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football team has also defended a good deal of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second.
Czech representation also won thanks to super Cech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification at the European Championship.
Montenegrains were under pressure until the second part because of a specific Czech defense.
The victimies of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent from the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football caisse.
From the first minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams were difficult to set up combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national football players has not come to pervert the Czech defence, which has precisely responded to the long shots even during the first half-time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human shield
A few hundred students from higher schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme through this gesture against any Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon outside the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Ispahan have created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center of Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
They have thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities is reported in Israel.
The students began to pray at noon outside the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, the aim of which is to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
Food for an obese child: do not take breakfast and take meat for dinner
Over a third of children between 9 and 13 years of age have overweight problems, 9% of pupils are above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows the importance of the environment in which the human being evolves and the models around it.
In obese children's tables, for example, carcutry is 50% more common than in families with children of normal weight.
19% of obese people had dinner fries according to the survey conducted with awareness-raising "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of small big sports is also not a habit, which is now the case of most schoolchildren today - only 15% replied that at least once a week the parents found the time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 students from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", action supported by General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students have enrolled in the project from sixth to third.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children in overweight, or even obese, is the absence of a correct diet and not enough exercise.
"Only half of the children asked to eat, for example, 5 times a day - breakfast - lunch - dinner - which is a basic principle of a good diet", indicates one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and meaty at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that a healthy development requires some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the students' families eat at the same time.
In most families each takes their breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been noted is that a tenth of the population does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that poor fries are more frequently consumed in the families of obese children.
Almost every student - without talking about weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70 %).
More than 40% of the children asked regularly do sports, but for parents it is only half, 15%.
Prepare your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diet on the basis of opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating".
Among their favorite dishes there are lots of cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming one is a great preference for sweet lemonade," is indicated in the results of the survey.
For lunch it is the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children at all did not want feculinates and preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness-raising session "Obligacy is not a coincidence", a determined willingness to move towards a healthy diet was assigned," the survey results indicate.
For example, the most important thing has been for sweet lemons because children have begun to give preference to drinking water.
Children have most often checked white meat and fish as their main dish on the questionnaire and would reduce sweet food and knedliky (Czech speciality of bread flour or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In an article on how to learn for stylists, I felt a little angry about the fact that there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what was going to happen afterwards.
The presentations of three specialist professionals, the costume of characters and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it'll be worse.
The more we approach final exams and the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it is really "tired".
This time with Director Alenka (there are no boys) we have treated the way to dress the woman who has no standard lies.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other has a boy's body, without any particular curve, another is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically remove wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have thus managed to beautifully highlight the character and also not to dress too visually types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine waist.
If, for example, there is a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth it to be done in a tailor-made manner.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is invaluable.
In a custom skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slides permanently, rolls and does not stick to the belt and so on.
For those with a male appearance, a Tucker-style dress may be allowed, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or embroidery.
There are, of course, many examples of 'miscellaneous' appearances and I am glad that I have all week long to sort out all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that in terms of what I have to do at home there are too many.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress up for the day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality fashion and its appearance.
I should "dress" Miranda Kerr, whom perhaps you know about the Victoria Secret campaign.
At the bottom of me, it's my pleasure, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken nearly 100 kilos lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the Internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship to graphic creation.
Thinking also on the graphic part of styling is also important.
The stylist does not just dress physics but creates, for example, productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic artist, talked to us about all this.
But that,... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three speciality guests gave a diverse aspect to the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphicist and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist can work with a single dress in a different way.
Variability is a key example of this.
Like for example this lace-coat that has to be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with escarpins and take it in photo as a dress.
Or just lift the sleeves or the neck and have a new look immediately.
"Joy with that," he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For the work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then begin to contradict it," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more clothing variants than those that are photographed.
That is to say, for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (including a dozen models) I must be ready to "retail" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to count on this in the course of creating a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made it a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists' services remains fraughty.
And the known faces sometimes consider them useless (it's enough that I know something but what I seemed to be going to second place).
And if someone gets a styling from us, then we have to count on the fact that he dictates us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one he actually has.
Then we only have to navigate on google and make sure that the boulevard info is a record of the celebrity in question, whether it is low or gross, etc.
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday's heart that 'it's not enough for the stylist to focus on fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he's wearing and it's so important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing people, not flattering, retaining their opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out his closet and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything and tell him, my God, what a horror."
"You'll find a few things that you'll find beautiful and you'll advise him what to wear them with," says Mario.
This one has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or the stylist's bag.
This is the one you hang around the waist and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, rollers for reproduction or baby pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple is not usable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
For us to be not only people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resuscitate shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently hurt ourselves.
We really need skills.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me for my creation.
The bill I'm telling you about is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of course
I am starting to understand more and more that styling is not a walk in a rose garden, which everyone says what they want.
The need for speed The Run fights all over America.
Revision
Originally, a problem-free race is transformed because of a bunch of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift to work.
It fills up to a certain extent everyone's ambition, but it does nothing if nobody wants to do anything more.
The new subtitled The Run produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed race series and get out a kind of game from the playable parts that wouldn't only count with points.
So we were curious how to be the added passages where the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As this is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what we were saying.
These are potentially arcade racing games, but the whole thing goes down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible finesse on the part of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You're caught in the adventure of Jack's main hero who has a lot of problems and to solve them starts to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the stages planned in different environments that are quite distinct from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel a single moment that the game proposes something identical to him.
Some environments are rather nice overlay even though the technical level is the same type as the previous series.
Finally, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in more time equipped with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you will find yourself in a sand storm that will significantly reduce your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Besides this the different races are well arranged one behind the other.
There are only a small number, but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the requested number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the watch (classic duke with the chronometer) and then again await another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult for you.
The new features are the out-of-vehicle crossings.
Rather, it's an interactive animation when most Jack runs in front of someone and you have to help him hit the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer times of this kind that you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is very much the same, as this element is not likely to interfere with and, in the context described above, can be found in the elements that appeal to the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that there is currently nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said that it is negative.
As for realistic simulation, you will have to go elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of race design.
So everything's okay.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
At the difference of the driving model, the one of the collisions is not yet in progress.
We do not expect from this game a complicated distortion and collisions, but when you do not have, in a collision with any object, any idea of how your car behaves, it is not entirely good.
During tight crossings you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car goes into crazy volts.
Or maybe you'll find yourself in pieces.
Thanks to the restart system it is not really a problem but it really agitates you.
The restart is done so that when you have broken the figure or you are out in the setting the game brings you back at the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you must restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't happen as it should, that something you can really rely on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and you have to find the solution by remembering the route piece in question.
The big highlight of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some curves that need to be passed in a certain way or not.
Otherwise you will meet in a given location civil vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, five seconds in advance or one minute late.
What makes them angry are the situations when you see easily passing the opponent between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you, you either have to stand aside and turn them over or brake them.
It's the same if you go ahead of him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always comes close to your nose.
Opponents still have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This is the worst at the end of the game when you're driving on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at all costs pass in front of you.
When it passes in front of you it hides you the view of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you come into collision a lot of times.
We can understand that the goal of this game is to do something catchy and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you are bored quickly.
And that's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything happening.
And it is equal if it is because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance to get bored or something else.
The original idea is to change cars during races.
You need to pay attention to gasoline pumps on the routes because you can change cars there however most of the time that you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large U.S. cylinders for right-hand highways and super sports cars with exotic surroundings on very technical roads, for example, on racquet roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places you know about the adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile that is shared with challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects start unlocking:
It connects on-line with the Autolog function, which compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult hits to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you ride in the dark on the roads (it looks like).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you arrive a metro ride that sends you the car directly to the scrap metal.
At the writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about the creation of this game or whether the authors really took us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is bothering is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true for accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer for you.
The sound part is good and the track is at choice.
For the sake of please to the greatest number and especially to the young audience a new sound track has been created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
Need for Speed: The run is really confused.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes, we could say without fear that it's the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The fun is really good but prepare you for what the faults kill you in the eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and Eurosceptics
The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions.
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players become accustomed to their new role," said Milena Vicenova, who began her presentation at the Faculty of Law of the Czech Ambassador to the European Union.
When she was able to describe the various EU bodies and their relations in such a understandable and visible way, to the extent that a large number of speakers at Charles University's Faculty of Law might envy her, she showed how seriously she takes her motto "comprehensible and openly about Europe".
Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms that he is fade, that he is a cook-up, that he cannot repel any mission and I have to say that he has breathed out to everyone because he holds his role in perfection."
"He is a man who is able to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe".
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy in an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "What phone number do I have to call?", thus as an important step towards unity and greater legibility of the Union's policy towards the states, as is China or India.
No one wants to ban our syracy (a very strong-sounded, boiled fromage)
Ms Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that has lived, lived and will live in the near future of the European Council.
She qualified the Czech Presidency as a success story two years ago.
The Czechs resolved the current financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It described the fall of the gourding as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the Ambassador, "the activity has beaten its fullness" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve now.
It is also necessary to approve the Union's new seven-year budget, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be thin and for economies, what priority will be given, which countries will be most assisted, at least, everything is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a comprehensible Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornichons, bananas of different sizes, or no one has forbidden us to make an syrup".
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A Europe at several speeds awaits us
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
It is also sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault is the result of several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a succeeding Czech Presidency, she then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman said to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is still doing this group of Visegrad?" and it is not at all happy."
According to Ms Vicenova, in the near future it will be hard new rules on budgetary policy that await the Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, except at several speeds, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institution of enhanced cooperation".
First, it was said that the countries that wanted it and those who did not want it would cooperate among themselves."
"There will be many such institutes and a truly two-speed Europe," Vicenova expects.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to identify the basis for all themes having an impact on the EU to be discussed among all EU members and not only the members of the euro area.
History of a trade mark:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the wordable that expresses the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the nearest would be "the long term".
For a broad IBM audience is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and however since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was laid by the firm's first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left the slogan that many global problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE" became the imprint around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
It was the basis of the company's culture carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived for 100 years because she remained faithful to her basic values and yet was not afraid to change everyone else around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society in our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more" declared the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano for the anniversary.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to look after his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM's people were the only ones among the first U.S. employees to have paid holidays, insurance paid by the employer plus a uniform of elegant employees and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and clerks.
Similarly IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was at first brilliant in the discovery of talents - as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman-Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
The company has been working at IBM for 30 years and currently holds the position of Chief Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has done what is called jamy, brainstorming online from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are almost 500,000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the company's internal and external image that assures it a secure position in the business field.
"Since the beginning of IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technological firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology," added Geogre Colony from Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM - or the "Grand Blue", as it is familiarly called in the United States in terms of its slogan- in one hundred years it grew up to become one of the largest global firms.
It is of course the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the server's product level up to nanotechnology.
It has many patents from all US technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among its discoveries are, for example, the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM came this year with 220 billion dollars the second largest technology firm according to the capitalization of the market (the first is Apple), when for the first time it deployed in 1996 Microsoft.
Overview of an Advance
Not all innovations and manufactures had the preference of the client and of the time - IBM, for example, did not win the bet on an operating system of its own OS/2, Prodige service online or IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the move in advance you cannot emotionally stay stuck on the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, Microsoft's competitor, who is at the base, remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However, still in 1990 it was with more of the most active participation motive of hardware.
As of the year 2000, IBM has sold low return assets for $15 billion, and over this period it has invested $58 billion in the acquisition of perspective technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008 when , for the first time , it surpassed the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its volume of investments.
Now it appears that IBM is passing the current crisis without being worried?
As of 2008, IBM's share price rose by 120 percent, the firm's net profit continues to grow.
IBM's logo is to change everything but not its values.
This is why this flexible giant can be expected to cope with other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York one hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name of Computing Tablating Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a trademark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four companies whose history is related to the year 80 of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the former "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 presided over the Supervisory Board of the company.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then shadowed the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that until now the identity and culture of society are based.
Watson ran the cusqu'en 1952 firm.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machinery for business and trade - from cheese and meat slices to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, sales increased to up to $9 million and began to expand in all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of leadership, his son occupied the chair of director Thomas Watson Junior.
Under IBM's direction, the development of artificial intelligence began and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s the people and computers of IBM helped NASA guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first computer family - IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer company to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company from Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to look after advice and services with high value added.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent looting of technology in areas that have not yet been exploited, such as urban transport and management.
With regard to IBM's trade area, a "Smart Trade" platform has been developed recently to assist traders in managing the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in our territory as well.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the global research and development team involved in the recognition of the word.
Rychtanova about her infidel husband:
Ivet you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtanova (53 years old) said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and established clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can go back home, but not like my partner," Rychanova explained.
When Darina Rychtanova gave asylum in summer in Bartosova in her home, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days to move from Ricany, Pepa did not turn the singer back.
And he publicly confessed that he loved him.
With the time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's relationship and finally said goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome her on the doorway of the house.
"This is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my old ass loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychanova filtered by showing that she had separated herself from her husband but that they remained only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I will stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife made a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we discuss in a completely normal way but we don't sleep together," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychanova finds a new love he won't stop him.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, with whom and if she has a connection.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all responsibility on me," Joseph concluded.
Women's Worst Vices: This also applies to you?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all of them, as well as others, are able to get them out of their "hands".
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of the female vices who come to pump the blood of the veins of men.
Procurement
Your half points out that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one garment per week?
Are you happy to buy and in packages at the time of the balances?
In your case, we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women feel that they should restrict their passion for buying.
But you'll say, which would resist the window lick of the clothing stores, to seek for themselves nice clothes and then try them all in cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse he was waiting for the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I'd need at least 5 kilos of milk - should I start doing sports?"
"I like you?"
Don't these phrases remind you of anything?
Yes?
You are therefore among those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop caring for yourself, but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints increase and the more toxic women become.
Odour and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite management.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the soil, dust, decapitulate the bathroom - and that twice a week.
You make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on clean ground, to the children that they have dirtyed the sink, shattered the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
If you are suffering precisely from this obsession, try to have in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanness can spoil your relationships and even family peace.
Sape work
"Put this worn over to the trash."
"You're gonna put those old socks on tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on earth."
If you do this work on your partner this way several times a day, you will really break it down.
Obviously you don't think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have to do so much sap work...
Defamation, Perspiration
Defamation, perspiration, as well as insults against someone, are also the property of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships and so are content to treat such topics as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each one of us is letting go of a little harmless piercing here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a special feature of women.
But the worst ones are those who advise, persist, even despise others and are particularly dangerous for their fellow citizens - especially at work in a women's collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in Philadelphia’s victory
The attacking hokeyist Jagr participated twice in Philadelphia's victory during the Monday NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again the head of the Czech productive players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was appointed the best player in the game, scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also scored two goals during the game.
Hunting after the game told extra-Atlantic journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big night.
"I told him before the game he'd give his hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you" explained Jagr after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second attack by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the palette and presented it to the goaltender Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part of the Flyers.
Especially in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's really one of the top three," said Jagr about his center.
"I never thought I'd end up playing with a hokeyjist like him."
"I'm really happy with that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at the NHL the other team players have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," added Jager.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again of Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not deviate from any other complications that ended at two to one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He fell on the pallet, I took the speed and (Read) went to the most distant corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the last goal of the game from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia has arrived with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he went out in second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not stand up to an experienced defender's advance of two goals lost after a penalty shot at 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It's the fact that the rear line was sick, which particularly upset the local coach rather than lost punches because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It's bullshit."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing to do, that's how it is," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement is not enough and we were unable to resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the palette out of our zone."
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P.K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, a Czech defender involved in the thirtieth attack in Winnipeg and the victory over Tampu Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, who stopped a series of 5 games lost.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
The travel agencies at that time offered trips mainly to the countries of the Socialist bloc, because the trips to the West were very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimean and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (the two in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have an inclination for the West and the trips to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the Socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In the event that the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, a letter of invitation was required, otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however, it was necessary to tail all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The foreign exchange agreement that was the condition to travel to the west was denied "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency, however, was not interchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs spent most of their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and chalets that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
The journeys of the Czechs have since had a great revolution.
Although the holidays in Eastern Germany and Bulgaria were at their maximum until 1989, the Czechs spent 4 million holiday days abroad last year in countries around the world.
The great paradox we do not know today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in neighbouring Western countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel by plane to the west for a long time that everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris the travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a journey from Czechs was at this time to take away his own food preserved, saucison, etc... to save.
Another important moment was the interchangeability of the Czech crown, which finally allowed our tourists after decades of freely buying Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage have increased, which has led to another important moment around 1997.
With increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have since 1997 started to prepare tours with air charter connections that through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what was before.
In the late 1990s the Czechs had visa-free links with almost most developed countries all over the world, apart from the EU, which later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared for an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year, direct air charters bring Czech tourists to distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100,000 Czechs who visit the exotic countries each year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutional development, arrived in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU deleted visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully fit into the developed group.
Also in 2008 Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for vacations abroad including ancillary expenses. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President but this could end with a situation without a "path" solution.
Almost 5 months already Czech football is without a President and he risks that Ivan Hasek's successor to the Czech Football Association will not yet be known after another General Assembly to be held Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement as to which voting rules should be adopted.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called for his colleagues to join and find a strong figure who will lead the football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek the football has returned to differences between the chambers of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and even there was no question of how to elect.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, does it seem, as statutory representatives or also staff members with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the State and Law Bureau, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences always continue over the settlement for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not brought anything to the fore either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the nevralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The discord apple is in the following fact: either to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model", found one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, which represents professional football within the association.
Under the rules of the planned model, in the third round, the candidate who has received the most percentage of votes in the Chamber for which he is a candidate wins.
Moravia is ready to withdraw to win the candidate who received the largest percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side examines the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the votes.
"Only that would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely deny the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian side and who would best not change the settlement and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he considers that the settlement of elections established according to Pelta's most advantageous status among all candidates.
"I wish to see maximum voting according to the statutes of the association".
"To ensure that there are not yet any samurai ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assemblys," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who is a candidate for the first time and who, in his presentations, defined himself primarily against Pelta.
The game remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive manner.
"Today's qualification in the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"The football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more support for cooperation" adds Jablonec's officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in the management of both professional and regional football.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense".
"This is not a problem between Czechs and Moravians, but there are trends to want to change drawing regulations."
"This can cause another blockage at the General Assembly."
"I still hope that good reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some rejoins should take place directly in Montenegro but can say whether the entire football management will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorice, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the field of reprisals.
At the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the broken parties from the country's largest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a State allocation, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the management of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If the leader of the football players of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly the profile of which would have responded to everything he was asking for for a new President of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic (AFRT), he would not be campaigned for this high position.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not stand for election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," said Paclik to the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try precisely to prevent Pelta from entering the head of the AFRT, which would be preferred for this election.
Paclik also points out that, in the event that he wins the elections, he would hold the post of President only until the year 2013 planned for a General Assembly.
He would see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but not linked to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he says.
"For me it was terrible when some told me that they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change this image," he added.
What is said to be particularly uncomfortable is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Union for Football of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man with the counter-reputed reputation that is known in the background as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates ' the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable for Pelta to take this position as President.
"If he were to win, the present state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with Berbr's support, which is a high-flying trader, it would be even less favourable to football," said Paclik.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta left without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we look at UEFA and FIFA?" said Paclik, who said some time ago, "if Pelta becomes President, I will sell the Plzen club."
In the event that Paclik triumphed in Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly which had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Petta) would be the first with whom I would go."
"He has great abilities"
"It would be able to present itself, for example, as the head of the representation".
"But as manager of the Association he wouldn't be able to."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik, who in September attracted great attention when he voted for the cancellation of the Arbitrators Commission with Ludek Macela, which replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he'd be at the level to run the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private companies and has also been running the Plzen Club since last year, with his support last May his triumph in first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring about a certain culture".
"I would slow down the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Board, which leads to bad taste situations," added Paclik, who did not neglect his antipathy for the Chief of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power in high-level policies would allow for more money from gaming tax for sport.
"This is one of the key points the new President should take care of."
"If it's the gambling tax as declared by political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take up his current relationship with the Plzen Club as something negative even though he himself claims that the President of AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again linked to Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla in Prague.
"It's not the ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my actions from the Plzen Club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Paclik said.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT that should end pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of Miroslav Pelta's candidates promised that if he was elected, AFRT would have new statutes that would put an end in the future to disputes over the settlement of the elections.
The public servant of Jablonec is very optimistic before the Thursday meeting in Nymburk and believes that the success today of the football representation should calm this guerre before the vote.
Pelta, prior to the September election that did not take place, promised to devote himself to national representation and obtaining financial resources if he was elected.
He has decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly, and this two-month delay could enable him to defend his vision of football leadership and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and waiting for a President to be here on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he adds, but it is primarily related to the Jablonec Club, which has worked for many years in the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is an euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately to the June General Assembly of Statutes were approved, which were not perfect as everyone saw it."
"If there were not all these various interpretations, we would have had a President since September," Pelta said.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that has taken the full attention of delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I am ready to assume all the responsibilities in the event that this does not work."
"It's a principle without which we can't exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes with regard to his legal training and that he is well aware that his candidate opponent would be his first Vice-President.
Nor has he long attacked Tonas Paclik, who on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and he's already had a few success stories."
"However, his attacks were not the most honourable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That is also why some people now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent, but remains, he says, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level to the national representation.
It's supposed to be a football viirne.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that start with that of the Bohemians or the follow-up to the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," said Czech press agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head football would not result in any change of people.
"I should get acquainted with all the employees," he told Strahov where there has been an understandable nervousness since there was no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believed that delegates would not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is one single point of discord on how to vote in the third round, we will be able to overcome it."
"The football needs credibility and it will only get it when it is headed by a new leader," Pelta says in an optimistic way two days before the day probably determining his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under its direction the AFRT would begin to work hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic in the General Assembly of Thursday, this would not please many people, he seems.
Rajchl, however, promises that in the event of his election we will start working hard.
He wanted systemic changes and made the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various fields of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and successful youth football."
"But I'm not saying I'm doing all this alone," said Rajchl in an interview for CTK.
"I'm a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member can deal with a specific area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions for football to take a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He said that he would not be a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth it and if I have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in the wheels and cast doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"A lot of people said to me anyway that I don't have to give up because they would also give up."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, they say, is also to continue the work begun with Hasek.
"Since the last two years there's been a lot of de facto work and I don't want to drop it."
"There are processes that have been initiated that will have consequences in a few years' time and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election the situation within the Union will not return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and it's something Mirek Pelta doesn't know how to do."
"Behind him are people who were in a football match in such a way that he would be only for those who were chosen."
"We can blame me for a number of things but surely not to bear which one."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football for all because everyone will be happy with it not only those who have been chosen
And he once again confirms that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division would be divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, the winners of which would be in first division."
"There would be no situation like currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel a support from the Czech Chamber, which elected me its Vice-President, and I know that there will be successes with me," said Rajchl, who envisages among his future successes the saving of tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiations with televisions and on the Games Act.
He says, on the contrary, that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault to all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he thinks the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has what to offer football.
"No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year."
"If he was elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make any significant change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his successes," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
The Julia Stanek
Furnace statues, beautiful pools of Budapest: who travels across Europe can live his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in gaseous water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missed in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Slung on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and was swimming against the Putten marbles that waited for her on the other side of the pool and did not lack to admire the Art Nouveau carefully restored from these converted pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleased him, she noted in her booklet without delay all the details worthy of interest about the type of construction and about the history of the building.
More than 200 pools have been explored in this way by the historian of architecture Meder and she presented them in her book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain).Münich's municipal indoor swimming pools, historic baths in the Black Forest, "Concrete Buildings Hardcore" in the Taunus.
In 13 countries, Austria and Switzerland, they visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia, respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a real strong member of the bath culture.
Meder, explains that she doesn't have much interest in sport but she feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It's annoying that swim supporters have to be content with watching blue tiles and accumulating with the stench of Javel's water while joggers are breathing in the scent of spicy forests or listening to the grassy birds of the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools should in fact always be so ugly," said the Vienna woman.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
A dive in a pool and the volatile sauna oils - a factor of well-being in the swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders were given a little more pain, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is transparent on one side, but reflects on the other side the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolor tiles, dips.
The image volume of small format "Badefreuden" makes a valuable report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives a desire to jump in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered outstanding examples during her research in Hungary.
In addition to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found nitrate-containing waters in a natural cave in the karst (Cavern Bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a spa bath whose basins are filled with water containing alkaline and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While a roof of the Zurich bath has the whole city in its sight, you can admire the snow-covered Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton: The Turkish bath has a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like an OVNI that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains from the Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of the water of Javel does not flow from all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths odor of sulphur, from Árpád-spa in the Bekescsaba Hungarians odor of oil, which is hard to believe, emerges from a healthy spa.
The smell comes from the therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its limon glues you to the skin as soon as you allow yourself to slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for the beautiful pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, an outdoor swimming pool free of charge and outdoors of Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricade.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was now closed.
By looking through the window of the Art Nouveau building in yellow-red-white-yellow, she observed the growth of the weeds between the tiles.
It has seen a different effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Spa Palace of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that have come out since its design in 1844 but also a Moorish Alhambra-style room that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the spa has remained the favourite bath of the expert in the pool, Iris Meder - and not only because it originates from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a good yield from melting construction styles so different into such a wonderful unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
The Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to look into the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the group leader then wanted to draw consequences from it.
Hamburg
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find unacceptable that banks are speculating on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of respondents even require that the German bank and other credit institutions interrupt this business venture because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this article, author Harald Schumann points out that the speculation of stock exchanges on global raw materials, raises prices upwards and that banks share a complicity with world famine.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically aligned with the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though the big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, the majority of the experts share the view that the betting team has been detached from the bids and is demanding - and benefitting from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to the criticism of American competitors differently: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, "no case worth putting into play the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, and then the results of Deutsche Bank's board of directors must be presented - usually recommended.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticisms of the financial sector: "The speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how harmful today's banks are to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wishes to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his duties.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the President of the Board of Directors will not change anything that is planned for the Board of Directors.
Ll could improve his brand image with a abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And with regard to possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would cancel investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday Survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires for 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank is proposing investments for which food price bets are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would cancel all investments for which money is injected into speculation on raw materials following the survey.
43 per cent would advise such a bank to their surroundings, 49% replied that they would consider the termination of their account to change their banking institution.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, stayed empty and then fell to ruin.
Now it is open again and is held as an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, its glass hangers, its lively and bold looks and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer's pavilion for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prize for Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture to date.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became famous internationally in 1973.
His design as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the southern station of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically adapted for a museum - no walls to hang works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used for so long until contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has become more and more detached.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the museum Belvédère opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance shot at any point of view.
The new departure was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco, has promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among others, in her youth as an artistic skater, subsequently at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she has carried out the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, she has obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established the exploitation of it.
Except for contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba, whose foundation bears the same name, have been exhibited there, a coffee shop and a bookshop there, and an office must be built there.
Close monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbring with sensitivity and he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "an energy gouffre", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, the glass fiber-reinforced insulating glass was laid and the roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridge beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a screen of light sieved between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but always the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The exterior doors of origin have remained, the house is painted in a color protection against red-brown rust.
And the cinema is exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Many of the materials that are good and cheap should be found, and they also enjoy the office of monument protection," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden is just the "quarter of the central station" all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance might happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another building Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the temporary art center Berlinese, and as he says, she is already negotiating with the city in order to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more this year in this respect.
The daily "Image"-Zeitung reported beforehand by calling for an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme temperatures.
Among other things, the number of internal and external employees involved in the snow removal of railway facilities and docks is expected to double and increase to 16,000.
The objective is to clear the snow and ice docks until the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track equipment required for the service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the Chief of Station Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because among other things it lacked reservations in the event of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been awaiting authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing what for years, since it has had to check the axles of the ICE trains significantly more often at the workshop, after a break-up of axles took place on an ICE in Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the Deutsche Bank's problems were not already sufficient, the past of this giant in the sector is also catching up with the USA: Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million in comparison to €106 million to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The regulator of the NCUA financial markets brings a whole series of accusations to the big banks, and this has encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized risks.
These documents lost enormous value during the financial crisis and led banks down.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties initiating proceedings in court," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank did not recognise any fault in comparison.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions from both banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now made are the first in their genre.
The regulator also took other large part banks and in summer he assigned them to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The question of mortgage documents is "mortgage-backed securities".
Credit houses are at their base.
When the US real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though events already date back a few years, at present it is blowing a storm on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have made numerous appeals to obtain redress or to sanction violations.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, the two US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of being advanced in kind in mortgage transactions of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank is also required to appeal to the FHFA, which is a number of transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005-2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific amount.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the applications as unjustified and stated that it wished to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, invests colossal money in the IT company of IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth over ten billion dollars.
Until now the US major investor Warren Buffett has repeatedly explained that he does not invest in IT IT companies, since the long-term evolution of companies shows only bad prognosis.
However, he read the IBM reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
He had already had to understand much earlier that IBM offers mainly services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knight's attack on the world of finance.
Therefore the IT IBM activity grants itself the right to now call itself "Monsieur IBM".
Car Buffett has today announced at the CBCC Economic Issue that he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM never knew anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
"You did a great job," said Buffett strategically.
IBM has for some time focused on IT-profit services as an operation of accounting centres.
The IT pioneer, over 100 years old, offers both software and consulting as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had so far avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in the companies he understands the business.
But on the contrary Buffett is more concerned with railway fret, with manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Her Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares with a wide range of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Rück Munichois.
In the 1960s, this 81-year-old octagénar had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and had made it one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of winning money earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
Following the announcement of Buffett's investment, IBM's shares increased by one percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", as also referred to as IBM, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the world's most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, says Buffett, he does not want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would now reborn.
The assassinations of eight Turkish citizens and one small Greek enterprise in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacted with fear and concern.
For many Germano-Turkish people, the spectre that had long been believed to have been reappeared: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with this extreme right-wing context against the Turks.
That there is a xenophobia in Germany, however, has never been mentioned.
However, the right extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions far from predictable.
"Is it a return to the bloody ideology", "Tel was the title of the publication on the Internet of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out, however, that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme right-wing bulwark.
It was reasoned that the Turkish community in Germany reacted: this weekend it called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence in front of the gate of Brandenburg.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community of Berlin and German and Turkish policies had thought of a ceremony for the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with gay colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media make the effect of a gifle: "the gift of Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
The German publication of the "Hürriyet" therefore does not deprive itself of the unanimous conditions.
This is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
He pointed out that people had been murdered, paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
Police action was viewed very critically on the German-Turkish forums, and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why the German authorities did not come to the mind much earlier to do research in certain extreme right-wing suspect areas, the perpetrators are astounding.
More than one shows itself ready for at least rhetorical and even drastic means: "If the matter continues to be broken, it will remain for migrants nothing but self-defence and armament".
"this will be the best self-defense."
"Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have been well explained.
The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here than there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which distrust and distance by acts of violence could result.
The attacks, however, have made us feel sharp in the Turkish community.
Never Repeat Past Errors
This was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks on which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Head of State of Turkey, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time counted in his speech, how many taxes were produced by the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German-Turkish people has been towards the state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts to clarify and reassess extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The scandal bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost gone bankrupt in the financial and patina crisis between times from crisis to crisis.
It's a German who has to run now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, he was told in July that he would hold almost as spectacular a post in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the big Swiss bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and profitable career.
Axel Weber has publicly welcomed, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently obtained solidity and made kind comments on future colleagues.
"The UBS has won the Turnaround."
"I am delighted with the collaboration with Kaspar Villinger and Oswald Grübel".
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A merchant of UBS securities in London had diverted all of the Bank's security systems and had set off about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS has since been considered a sufferer - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administration presidency already in May - not in 2013, as announced by the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adjustment.
At the same time, he assumes responsibility for a bank's strategy, which has just proved once again that she has long deserved the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, the UBS is on one side huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing, it seems, saves the so proud Swiss bank.
It began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The Swiss asset manager's image, silent and strong, but also rough, had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become a very large bank in the field of banking investment.
So the UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy customer than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made a lot of sense.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of banking for long years in Zurich says: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank before my students."
"From the current point of view, we wonder: how could I have just wronged myself at this point?"
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something didn't turn around at the UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, which was so far considered a high intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later, we pressed for what reasons he left.
The bank's division had started with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of CHF 13 billion and made a cross on it.
For this, it has actually found investors, but who, not long before, would have rubbed the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state base from Singapore and an Arab state base, which was silenced, to the point that one has never even learned his name.
It was only the first shot.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank had to announce losses of billions again, and Marcel Ospel's Chairman of the Board of Directors, who was still Switzerland's second best-paid board of directors in 2006, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state due to its investment errors.
The National Bank bought from the UBS tens of billions of problematic securities, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds into shares, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country, home to such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the 2007 UBS was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster he followed the second.
Just a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated due to a tax dispute with America and was ready to publish the easy customer data, which might have falsified the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in return for unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus, the UBS published more or less than it had helped in tax fraud.
At the same time, she has lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the withdrawal of the Head of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the flight of customers' money.
In a few months' time the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as we thought, that the UBS would get away from it, it followed this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single flash title merchant of 1.7 billion euros, before the bank saw that something was not turning around.
And it is published: with the management of investment bank risks it still does not seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been observed that risk control has changed too little," said Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Bank Institute at the University of Zurich.
Thus, the financial director of a large German bank is certain: "the problem with the UBS is that it does not have control of risks in hand."
However, it was exactly the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had long assumed their role, that of being the guardian of the world's great fortune: not too great a risk, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The Swiss banks' treasures had become a symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS power station in Zurich is still paired with the strong photograph of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at Zurich Central Station, which runs directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by snowy peaks in the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's, you can find them here among the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli Confectionery.
For centuries Swiss banks have resided here: from the national bank through the palace of Crédit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered in marble, there are thick leather chairs in front, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the client is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day left the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, the UBS and Credit Switzerland, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with the two big banks as well.
The UBS would have become far too large, it finds - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would have also spread.
The Swiss would no longer have anything to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then debacle: no European financial institution lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country to the seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," wrote author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a huge group.
A bank has been created, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and has constantly registered an increase.
What has helped is that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already more internationalised.
Suddenly, international investment banks have had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a team of dreams," said bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, which is very well understood in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, which has paved the way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted himself until the end in Wuffli.
And Wuffle would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.
The staff of the UBS clearly remembers the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group always spoke the same word: destroy Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She ordered the "League Tables" the rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all the UBS wanted to climb it up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
However, corporate advisors, who were responsible for this, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the "Fixed Income" banking jar, there would be a huge difference from the largest banks.
The UBS would have deficiencies in US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS started an adventure, which almost cost it life.
As a growth partner, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packed and passed value documents based on US mortgages - but has also retained risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long way to go down.
"Even in the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says Geiger, the banking expert.
The more euphoria is greater the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to leave, when ending the attempts turned out to be more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and are so far bankable.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentrate on the management of assets, and return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want to (yet) go as far away.
But the investment bank must be atrocious as far as it is clear.
Next Thursday the bank leader Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
Italo-Switzerland, aged 51, was only supposed to be in a transitional capacity when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has imposed itself: it must conduct the business of the UBS on a permanent basis, communicated to the Bank of Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to progress in the mid-1990s.
He cancels 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
To date, he has only publicly stated that he was going to seek an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the American stock market
The threat of recession in Europe at the end of the week has discouraged US investors.

Europe will soon not be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to put an end to the crisis," he said in an interview to CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early in its view to invest in bonds from European states and banks.

Smart cornets spread in cities
In many places, fire is considered a "bird problem" but experts say these very intelligent animals have no longer been hunted for cities for a long time.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Cornets have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities complaints from residents are multiplied by dirt and noise from animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfreisisch symposium on the horny, the experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt the fraternity of the cities.
The experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature's protectors were based on urban problems as well as on the exodus of particularly protected fires: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional areas of life.
The hunting, development and slaughter of typical cover trees made life difficult for birds.
The cornets are protected by nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 cover pairs in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest among them Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity due to the massacre of cornets in the area.
Critics found birds in traps and killings with particularly brutal gourdins.
"Normal expulsion, evacuation, is no use," noted Werner Klövern, the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer.
The destruction of nests with the help of water under pressure or the felling of trees, often has adverse consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr at Bade-Württemberg.
"The animals move away, the large colonies divide and they disperse in other places."
In exceptional cases, such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools, there is only one possibility.
"We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer destroy them."
The problem is not resolved in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Suitable is a combination of the rearing of animals in a pre-filled condition and sticky offers, in order to allow them to reinstall elsewhere.
Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist, was looking for "new signs instead of cross-sections" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button on the face with a dose of confidence in ourselves."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-Educative Road of the Trash at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the life of these very intelligent fires.
This project has been adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: "These many communication, these birds have a lot to say to themselves".
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Fries not only use work tools to get to a regal, but they make their own tools as work tools.
Ethologist from Cambridge University tested four recently, how intelligent the birds are.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to crash a scavenging with stones to reach a larvae.
Without much training, they definitely recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to make the platform collapse.
In a second test, the astute horns were then to solve a more sloppy problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small seam with a larve.
Birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
However, the researchers had made pieces of wire available to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small sole of the small pipe.
Three of the four friars are even successful from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo takes Portugal to the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a blow by the Bosnians and Turks remained unsuccessful.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland will also participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have bought the last tickets in the European 2012 championships in Poland and have suddenly eliminated Ukraine.
Accompanied by the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal fought against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and perfected, after the 0:0 of the match, its fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the playback elimination game by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) had already been one obvious thing.
There was also nothing burning in the zero game 0:0 between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) release against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) marked the other shots for Portugal.
The former player of the Bundesliga Wolfsburg, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a hand-played 11 metres (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free shot of 30 meters in advance in meshing.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his shooting qualities at a distance and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half hour did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the British Manchester City championship, initiated a headball leading to the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek has scored a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, the arbitrator Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding is at the center of all the attentions.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the opposite side, Stark granted a penalty of 11 meters played by the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentiro, which Misimovic probably divided.
But after the break, the vice-champion of Europe in 2004 succeeded four blows and everything became clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81st minute.
For example, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) also had a chance and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Petr Cech goaltender prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by Tomas Sivok potentials (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic duo were in action.
Damjanovic scored at the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to the Cech shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the aid of the world class guard of Czechs already shot down, once again, the attacker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb’s football miracle during that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While the national coach Guus Hiddink had also had to abandon his position on the bench of the third of the 2002 EM, the Croats were able to welcome their fourth round in the final of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maxismir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream departure.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long shot only the pole, attackr Kazim Kazim could not even bury the balloon in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats let nothing burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at the 62nd minute, the legionaries of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapatoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish have celebrated their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team from coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken care of with a success of 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) has equalized for visitors.
Ireland grew at higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy got the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defence has been able to prevent a possible goal of the first goal.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of the Pavel Londak goalkeeper, Ward was at hand and tied the balloon on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, said Dax Group on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly," announced CEO Bill McDermott to its clients on an equitable basis in Beijing.
The workforce will increase from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of industries in the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4000 of the 176,000 global SAP customers are located in this expanding country.
China's growth plans are also an important part of the Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.

Currently, the management of the software provider's business, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked as well.
SAP has been active in China for over 20 years.
"Now, we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
Abandoning of personal mass
The new book by Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. Titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (Beauty and grief: an intimate story of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that closes your heart.
A tip to start: carefully tear this page and make it your brand-page.
You will learn about these people in detail. In Peter Englund's romance story, this list of characters will be your GPS, a tag during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mist of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Here he wrote an unusual book that he accurately describes as "an anti-history book."
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors or discussions on strategies and materials.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it might look like." We find here the "sentiments, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and grief" summarizes the experiences in times of war of 20 men and women more or less ordinary, from both sides of the war, from young schoolchildren and botanists to escalators, through doctors, ambulances and sellers.
Some of us will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose members, get crazy or lose life.
Their lives wail here like the candles of a church: while some are dying, new ones are ringing.
Peter Englund's book deviates from traditional historical books.
He denied the idea that the First World War was merely a summary of the terrible war of trenches on the western front.
"Beauty and grief" can well describe other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and Eastern Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsezé-tsé flies are an intraitable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people, such as a natural catastrophe, such as a Hurricane Katrina who pouts the cordite.
When there is a sound of cannon in the distance, and you are a mother in the house, shall you stay or flee?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been amplified by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English feeder in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stump, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be frightening or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them deal with deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminium, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on substitute food in Germany.
It describes "the meat made of cooked rice in sheep's fat (and finished with a false wooden bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden soles."
He claims that "837 authorised alternative meats are recorded in the production of sausages. There are also 511 alternative coffees."
Some stories address honour and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive towards wilderness and states about the war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were meant to do, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than claiming that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarians behind your empty and nailed shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
"When we are assigned to sacrifice, we hope to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, it's more like "a man who's been strangled in secret."
Other observations relate to the decline of old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming increasingly a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He seized the arrival of what he called "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executed his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, that the soldiers buy and spread on the genital organs in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into blindness to life."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostensatory, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps the way in which the war "set out exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making war with them.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "West Nothing New", by Erich Maria Remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming thing I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had emerged from his book, seized from your hands this page where is the list of people and burned with a light.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen as Zuccotti Park would be empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few senior officers, as well as from the beginning informed that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, with his presence highlighting the risks and challenges to the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, which went against the department's regulation and caused a storm of public solidarity for demonstrators.
The operation to clean Zuccotti Park of its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were prepared to observe the course of occupation in other cities.
A capital exercise was organised on Randall Island, for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorism measures that consist of moving quickly a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the side of Manhattan on the East River.
The orders given to move in the park arrived "at the last minute", said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few police officers I know who were called didn't know they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person under anonymity.
"The only ones to know that they would go there are at the top of the hierarchy of the police department."
The city was able to keep a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14th, police wanted to clean the park, but hundreds of protesters were pushed away with plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighborhood - from dozens of officers used to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, in the manner of migrants, so an hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was necessary to proceed when the park had fewer people," he said.
Vehicles from emergency services with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before taking action.
The recorded lights and messages from the speakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
While community business officers entered the park equipped with their clear blue wind, many protesters simply gathered their business and left.
No tent was hit before 1:45 a.m. said the police, which allowed the occupants time to bring their affairs together.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists present inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the Chief of the Police Department, stated that this measure had been taken only by security.
But according to many journalists, the police had prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which was brutally held by the officers.
Browne stated that the television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police moved west across the thick business lanes of demonstrators, including luggage, plastic grass and sacks of sheets filled with clothing, teams from the Department of Sanitation followed, cleaning everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the centre of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police moved to methodically stop.
A dozen people at the epicentre of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people joined trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the padlocks.
No arrest took place in the park before 3:30 a.m. Mr. Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
most for "disrupting public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, Chief of the Police Department, is the highest-ranking officer on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Kelly, although present, said Mr. Browne, "not running the operations."
A second group of police officers were on the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block of houses north of the park, and on Pine Street south.
The police were seen to extend the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the strongest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the hood of a police car. Others were seen digging the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plaster came out flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The School Support Union continues the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school aids that lost their jobs last month, plans to bring a trial to the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The prosecutions are probably the union's ultimate weapon, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel the dismissals.
Six hundred and sixty-two school aids, parents' coordinators and other employees, who were among the least well-paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7th. The union leaders compared these redundancies to a political revenge so that they did not let the city have access to a health care fund led by the workers' groups, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this charge.
At a hearing of the Municipal Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott stated that the redundancies constituted part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, noting that the redundancies in school aids were not specified in the budget.
Council officers from the 37th District stated that they would complete a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecutions to the Supreme Court of State of Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the City's Department of Education will constitute the defendant party. The complainants will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all black or Latin American, like most school aids who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the legal department of the city, said that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
Based on a draft of complaints from the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of redundancies in the city's most disadvantaged neighbourhood schools to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and only a few in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 school aids have lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx District.
Noting the loss of five school aids out of eight employees in Harlem Public School 36, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecutions state that "It is not a nice neighborhood of parents who can bring funds to fill the budget deficit."
The public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrolment.
The union also claims that high school directors were misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six parents' coordinators were dismissed", and "not only because of overrun".
Mission completed: Congress agrees on Libya
Finally, it would appear that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement in the Capitol on the question of the uprising in Lydia.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as the American involvement.
The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democracy - Massachussetts), with Senator John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators of both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving whether or not the United States military role in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to allow the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day as the failure of the bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of US operations in Libya.
The US mission has therefore remained in the form of a legislative purgatory - Congress sufficiently upset to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut off the grass under foot.
The indecision of Congress has been exceeded by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "rejoices the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "rejoices the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win all the support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will the legislators divide as in June?
The Senator and Chairman of the Richard D. Lugar Commission (Independent) opposed the last version.
His spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of new project.
Within the Capitol, this week the House must vote an amendment to the Constitution in order to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicans of Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or in the Senate.
Other legislators have so far not been able to have their amendments approved, but this is not without trying.
The Goodlatte amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments to have been presented to Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others are slight variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handle that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - especially the new Republicans who wish to give birth to their CV - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, approved last August, called for the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to lift the two mandates for the Presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between same-sex individuals is always proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the profanation of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the annulment of federal laws if two thirds of the States are opposed to them.
As much as Members have been keen to propose amendments, they are not as fast as they have been in the past.
At the 111st Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The rate slowed down compared to the early 1990s, when members usually proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, based on the figures provided by the Library of the Senate.
But these amendments did not have much more success than they do today.
The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacre but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords during his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him over at Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democracy - Arizona) appeared on a television show on Monday evening, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" in Broadway and said he wanted to recover first of all rather than go back to Congress.
When he appeared in the TV newspaper "20/20" on the ABC channel, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The show touched on his difficult return after the bullet that broke his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
During his first interview on TV since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, when Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, replied "instead well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of "20/20", broadcast the day before the release of the new couple's book entitled "Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope".
The special show has traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, shaved head and a large scar on the front.
She can use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors teach him to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask him to change his breakfast menu.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: the Representative is singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with the doctors, said he did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information about the six people killed during the incident for the first time.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is vigorously treated pending trial.
"There have been a lot of deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
When she recovered, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, "I was beaten."
"I'd say Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You were just massacred.
And you're gonna get out of it, recover, and come back even stronger than you've ever been.
More pity than respect for troops
The event: a gala in Wall Street to harvest millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a dance on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in a tie-up costume stood at his feet to cheer him up.
"The soldiers, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A military high-grade present in the gala, in which Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, also participated, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were presented as a sort of orphan," wrote the military high school in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just mercy.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have some price, say some soldiers.
The public acts increasingly as if he were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to put ourselves in the role of evil spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not want to appear unappreciative or in disagreement with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam war has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations on mercy take place in confidence among veterans.
After the return of his two sons to the battle with the Marines, Retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and travelled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who were making interviews with him asked him in a subtle way whether he would be able to stay under the stress of a job demanding Washington immediately after he returned from the fight.
"When you address the subject of service, you face negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The military's difficulties arise, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely welcomed by such an unrecognized country with the army, which sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for World War II," said Lieutenant General Retired David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people focus largely on the depth of the sufferings of a soldier.
The troops are recognized for the number of service periods, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The Army Faces the Growing Pressure to Suffocate Against the Rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for an alleged rape inaction.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
The first-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008 when she returned to her barracks in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a beer pack.
He asked if he could join her in his room to drink a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texane put aside his concern.
No, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man caught her from behind, thrown on the ground and raped, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will be anxiously awaiting the court decision at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, and will decide whether a trial against the former defence secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not stopping the generalization of rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
The trial, originally ranked in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, involved 17 complainants, 28 months later - 25 women and 3 men, all of whom claimed to have been sexually raped or abused by fellow soldiers, and also claimed that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she's taking care of the gallant soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisal?
Counsel also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom may be part of future judicial proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of bringing together all complainants in this case - putting all its eggs in the same basket - it will bring in several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defence, headed by American lawyer Neil MacBride, tabled a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused by the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision called Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active staff.
"The alleged ill-treatment is inherent in the military service of the complainants " indicates the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not have, officially, the right to go to battle, this distinction is written only on paper: front lines of recent wars are rarely male only.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women ' s teams are playing an increasingly important role, including in getting in touch with local women.
The result: 150 women soldiers lost their lives in both wars - two thirds in combat.
It is time for the army to modernize itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are in progress in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Centre is preparing a case against the four main military academies for the alleged encouragement of misogyne ambiance.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of "personal disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a trial with the Veterans Administration in December, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for persons reporting sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defence's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of the cases recorded in the army were the subject of a trial - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case described their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell her 11 times in detail about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and her aggressor's blood - due to a cut to her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting before a judge at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six people testified as a moral witness to the perpetrator, who ended up being acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was rendered," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I'd start to have contractions. I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commander, "It wasn't his trial but mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, it was referred to in terms less than honourable persons, preventing it from receiving any advantage.
Whether or not the Lyman case and the other complainants will move forward is a long story, says John Turley, professor of law at the Faculty of Law at the University of Washington.
However, he remarked, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward".
Only this doctrine that has been criticized since its introduction lies between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army finds itself decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence posed by responsibility.
" chances are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things change only when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn for them, Susan Burke, the complainant's lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is a reform," she says.
Where until we die, either of the two options.
The walls have eyes: the researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who shared his anti-immigration views online.
Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been taken from a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, faced his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time preceding the attack on his computer, discussing with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy... Sign in to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS think-tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is filled with so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the website's advertising tool to find the people they're looking for with scientific precision - the way Mercatics have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found out that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of connecting them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey. The questions asked concerned their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question 10,000 supporters of 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way to do research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those behind their computer screen."
DEMOS's study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new, unmissable tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all subjects that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to the "Like", wall publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, the "supernova of data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research projects whose name appears in the title of almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not approach in the street.
"Before you tried to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook of their exploitations in the ebriet state had much more chance of being alcoholic than discreet students on this subject.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as advisors, could monitor the site and intervene to possibly help a student whose status would too often speak of alcohol.
"You can't treat a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Children's Health, Behaviour and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, says Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not be recognized in another case."
Facebook also constantly accesss the information of its users.
The data team of the site studied statistics on the loving situation and on Valentine's Day, the participation rate in mid-term elections in 2010 and a national happiness index (through information only available - the digital freedom champions have for a long time argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play the Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation that they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is something else online.
"I do not believe that many users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist at the Knowledge Laboratory in London, according to a 2006 study he conducted while observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As long as they knew, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you're saying about Facebook and what you're doing in reality are two totally different things," says Neil Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and pen remain the best tools we can use.
"No one can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social is not in front of a computer."
"Friendly and inhumane": the first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" at his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Norwegian Templars," he explains in front of an audience of 500 people.
"With regard to the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it, because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought a paper talk with him, talk to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Justice Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, for four weeks forbidding him from talking to the media, and warned him that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure he would be put behind bars.
All participated in the hearing to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhumane," said a survivor of Utoya on Norwegian television NRK.
"I was not comfortable, but I personally made some progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Breivik, dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye when entering and leaving the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a large movement of "resistance," the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of 22 July therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than of a whole group of radicals, which may be some comforting.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I'd have preferred him to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said one victim's relative.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons from the lost interview with Steve Jobs, in cinema this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared it to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical engineering and inventor of modern computer science.
But what Apple fans can find more revealing in a recent interview with Steve Jobs, which will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how much this creative mind had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself as a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an enhancer of organizational charts - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from "a disease that leaves them thinking that a great idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sat with Steve Jobs for more than an hour for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cryingely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in transportation.
It is only after Steve Jobs' death that a full video is found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly uplifted, is the base of the 68-minute film entitled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast in the movie on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who's known to hate the in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems surprisingly enthusiastic here to expose technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurrects, where it seems eager to hear the questions of Cryingely, giving him a blow to speed it up and move on to questions or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, we find a strangely prominent aspect of Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he sees as good or bad among other companies and shares his own vision of the future of IT.
It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of Steve Jobs' career, but there is something brutal and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and must be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here's a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
" throughout all these years, I have always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are always the same: 'Oh, just because you have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one thinks in depth about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues by detailing his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how the costs were recorded - often beginning with a "standard cost" assessed for nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On the occasion of playing a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack telephone networks and call for free in long distance.
The device has been the subject of numerous writings in advance, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in its description of the Blue Box as an appropriation act is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, passing a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped up the ball of different things half a dozen times and you screamed in the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone aside," explains Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create ourselves something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't know much about both, but we knew how to invent a little thing that could control great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without that.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful turn that he and Wozniak developed: he telephoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by passing for Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are convened in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices are going crazy just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and the start of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to manufacture a frequency meter, he looks for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and takes him a wire shot.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and that formed my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first ever desktop computer designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a little cathode tube. I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
Improvising innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a glance.
At the beginning of his career, as he settles to sell some printed circuit cards, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days' credit, it had to deal with assembly and delivery of finished equipment.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big fights... they screamed at me, claiming that I would have to be five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that was incredibly reliable.
Among the large companies that are emerging:
Even before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders were going to deceive themselves and lose control of their market share.
"Let's let you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can change it, so [it is these types of people] who end up directing companies and the specialized personnel in production are removed from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely ruined by people who cannot imagine designing a good product relative to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have held the entire computer industry.
She could have done her current size ten times. Xerox was the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They broke the defeat at victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge piece of manual work separates a brilliant idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a great deal about his subtleties.
There are compromises to do... Something you can't do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, the factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by putting them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose you to the best products men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that the good artists copy and that the great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who just proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with health law opponents as the court meets
On the day when the Supreme Court met in private to discuss the issue of political discord, i.e. whether the opposition to President Obama's law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm of lawyers who will defend the case in the High Court.
The event was held last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases concerned a 26-state trial challenging the ambitious health care reform voted by Congress last year, a law that was a rally point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 am is expected in March, and the result is likely to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be growing at the time of the court's decision.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as a U.S. general seeker during the administration of George W. Bush.
The legal firm of Clement, PLC Bancroft, has been one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society (Federalist Society), a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial issue in the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a hotel in Washington a few hours after the court conference on the case.
These included Mitch McConnell, a top Republican in the Senate, and a declared opponent of the Health Act.
The dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend fund-raisings of legal and other organizations although the judge may not be an intervener, an honorary guest, or listed on the program of such an event".
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alert government ethical activists.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the declarations of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and eating and collecting gala funds with lawyers who had cases pending before the court."
Their presence and participation in the fund-raising of this event exposes any claims of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little respect for critics claiming that they are too easily mixing court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
The Conservatives also claim that Judge Elena Kagan has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general seeker of the Obama administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought to the level of the court of first instance.
Her criticisms put pressure on Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying that she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records a record $18 billion order for line aircraft
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, bi-collar line aircraft, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, an estimated market worth over $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives an order containing 50 of its products.
On the other hand, it is a whole business when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record $18 billion sum.
Just as incredible is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East airlines will need a total value of $2,520 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed about the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-collars.
It is the company Emirates based in Dubai that has placed this pharaonic command.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to buy more 20 aircraft, which would raise the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing announced on Monday that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant savings in fuel and convenience for passengers.
The total amount of these six devices is over $1 billion.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, analyst of Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have enormous value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They have not only the means to pay for these aircraft, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so damaging to them as the country would gain money from the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their aircraft orders when the price of oil increases, said Dihora.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
Emirates' control strengthens Boeing's dominance in the wholesaler aircraft market and helps to curb the attempt to invade the Airbus competitor with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the Aeronautics show comes four months after Airbus' announcement to postpone the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing back its beginnings to increase its momentum as a result of its customers' demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
The Boeing company's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president obviously beaten in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race to the position of governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to gain access to the functions of Governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers have favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was in the lead of the race to the position of governor of that Western State.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral officers... they seized the urns, installed roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until losing its presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have noticed only a few Calderon, who was in the lead of the polls before the election day.
Calderon, the Conservative Party candidate for his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a leftist candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently serving as governor, came third, a painful defeat before the presidentials of 2012 for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence persisted.
One week before the elections, a mayor of the NAP was murdered as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally because of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, has congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to come and help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank asked India and China to prepare themselves to help the euro area exit from the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director General of the Manila-based BASD, said that the two fastest-growing economic powers in the world had to "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at the difficulties of Europe's "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support along with Europe's leaders and resources would help to avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We are all in this crisis together."
"Therefore anyone can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he said to the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it is not sheltered."
"Then if China and India can help, nothing prevents them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing was dangerously increased and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece resigned.
The booming crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has led to the fear that the world economy will return to recession, and has prompted major emerging economies to meet to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag claimed that the IMF would channel all Asian aid, but he also stated that bilateral assistance - such as buying the US financial rescue fund's obligations, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Minister of Trade and Indian Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a fall in foreign capital arrivals.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find jobs for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans as they face their own important economic challenges.
Ascutosh Varshney, Professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to get Europe to accept aid to the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live at $2 a day, or even less.
"One day, they will find that the Greeks retire 50 years old and leave for a holiday in the sun and they will find it hard to fit," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Mr. Nag said that the euro area crisis risked causing "substantial impacts" across Asia.
BASD's forecast of economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 is now facing "loss risks" due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed "to develop "emergency plans" to protect themselves from economic turnaround and major capital leaks.
Sequences Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defence Reductions
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, put pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. He triggered a financial chain reaction of the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields, through the gatherings of civilians.
The Pentagon already earns $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but is now concerned that an additional $600 or more of reductions will be imminent if the Congress fails to reach an agreement on expenditures.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the Congress's failure to reach a budgetary agreement resulting in what is called sequestration would result in 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"This important reduction, applied without discernment, would render most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts," says Panetta to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay to achieve the goal."
"These changes would aggravate the faith of those who support our soldiers and seriously damage our preparations."
Reductions would possibly affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
"Although wartime financing of contingent operations abroad is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contracts supporting war."
" personnel managing salaries would be reduced, leading to late payments to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, requesting details of the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The result of a sequestration of the Department of Defence would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as an uncontested world leader in military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," said the senators in a joint communiqué Monday afternoon when the Panetta letter was published.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not the consequence that we should impose on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
That Panetta's letter and recent honourable senators' warnings increase the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself has reached the highest position in the Pentagon, accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defence painted a dark picture of what could happen - a soldier with a shell, but not a kernel.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, poorly prepared and unable to cope with potential opponents."
"In fact, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically outlined how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in future combat operations".
And Panetta stated that some of the largest defence projects could go to the couper, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
The list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the new-generation ballistic submarine, the new battleship and the new ground vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the Army and the Navy.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to Identify a Lie
A look at the recent headlines indicates the extent to which deception and lies are omnipresent in daily life.
The Republican candidate for President Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were accused of having allegedly covered reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone saying to American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman Anthony Weiner's celebrity and Internet-based celebrity, has been considered an idiot by quickly issuing unfutable evidence to contradict the accusations.
The former candidate for President John Edwards was accused of violations of the funding of campaigns related to the coverage of an extra-marriage relationship.
And then, none of those who have lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term of office about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been cases where teachers gave test responses to students to check out their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we face?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a social game like, let's say, charades, where the aim is to write: "I have had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research on such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about the lie have been demystified.
The liars look you in the eye.
They don't always begat, shout or act.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to detect.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the time of response.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge of deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are able to read others properly, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "centred on them" while women say more lies "centred on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - than married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as an unbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if anyone is lying?
First, observe the normal behaviour of your subject.
That's what we call establishing benchmarks.
This helps provide a point of reference to measure future changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, laugh, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally puts their feet in a permanent position so as not to make unfair accusations when you see them put their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for indications of verbal and non-verbal misleading behaviours.
Consider these clues to be red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, lean towards an exit, change posture significantly or present a "post-interview" relief - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a shift of posture when all the difficult questions are gone.
The interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is just finished to seek trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson skipped using the past while claiming his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a far-reaching language: "I have not had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or simply repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "woody language" in his answer to a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember property... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances for anyone to avoid victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial oil pipeline plan will be disrupted after the threat of late approval by the United States
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - arousing the anger of trade unions while calming environmentalists - the company seeking to build the oil pipeline said it was prepared to redirect the project to the rails.
TransCanada stated Monday evening that it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Nebraska dunes zone, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's official Alex Pourbax states that the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval from an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the Department of State last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogalla aquifer, large groundwater sources.
"This is a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have delayed any decision until 2013, following next year's elections, although officials deny the involvement of policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed support for it.
The 2.735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the Texas refineries.
In order to do so, six States would have to be crossed.
It is hated by ecologists, but loved by working groups, who have put out the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the oil pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislators opposed this plan put pressure on a law to force the remoteness of the Sand Hills region and the Ogalla Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomiting of fear
A New York family claims that the Disco Diva Patti LaBelle launched into a riot of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she missed fear.
The draw of the singer "Lady Marmalade" scared the little 18-month-old Geneviève Monk, to such a point that she suffered "personal changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of foreigners," said her family during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 of last year when the stage technician Kevin Monk, her child garden teacher, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going for the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the hall of their building on the Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and laid her daughter for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said to me, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle annoyed the pregnant woman with anger.
"She said to me from an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," says Roseanna Monk.
"I said to him, "What you say or think I'm not interested."
She became enraged and began to use jurors - the word "" and the word "" with a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started to spray water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who was always holding Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her surroundings who trained her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl cried so hard that she started to throw up, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note requesting LaBelle's apology, but received no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unclear damage, but family lawyer, Sam Davis, stated that he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money received to a charity work against cancer for children.
"The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a teacher of a kindergarten with a child of 18 months old."
Climate change has hampered the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, unemployment and informality in Sinaloa increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-named for change, which has generated great expectations with regard to the advances of the economy, but given the climate opposition of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February, apart from causing losses of trillions for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, have caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the frozen assignment report from the Mexican Rural Development Council Supportable, there were 582 million 835 hectares of crop damage, of which one 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main pest crops were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment in the first three quarters of the year rose steadily until November, as an increase was observed, as from January to March 55 thousand 053 people were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate of more than 74 thousand people unemployed, an increase from the first half of 18 thousand 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity on the market is due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn money illegally it is not easy that they work to gain them, that they invest them and use them in something," he said.
Migration detained
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad, in the United States, has been limited, primarily because of entry difficulties, and secondly because by entering them already have a lot of difficulties in finding work, these people remain here and ask for sources of work, which means that unemployment is rising," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labour market in allalon is worsening by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state work there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of serious, another reason for the state to lag is lower wages, the entity has lower wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
Until September, the average monthly earnings of allerloen workers were 5 000 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7 000 375 pesos.
Contraception of FDI
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June Government FDI reached $630 thousand,697, which represents a decrease of 87.74 per cent from the $5 million,143 thousand,312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by the companies of the tertiary sector.
Debt
Given the economic contraction scenario, in July the Government of the State requested approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivation of the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November no benefit of debt in any sector of the State economy was observed.
Responses
For representatives of the employer sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrated a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the will of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year was really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, it has had to align the effort of all and above all the already synchronized work of this new government team, hopefully much better next year," he said.
Economic slow-down
Loredo López stated that events such as early-year freezes have held back the state economy and have reduced its return and growth.
"The low economic flow is generated by several events, among which the freezes, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate economic dynamism that allows for an acceptable level of e flow in trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that the government is to be channelled into productive activities with greater dynamism.
"In general terms, we have observed that work has been done, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, as it is important to demonstrate the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
Much to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better channel the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in various areas, there are some advances in economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in how public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still much to do," he said.
Convicted for 8 kilos of marijuana
One resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fine for eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted small trader is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for health offences, in his variant of possession of marijuana for sale.
In accordance with AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army officers on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Street Valdez, ahead of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small smuggler was moving in a white-colored pick-up van in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle's luggage carrier and on the co-pilot's seat a small backpack where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements have been made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted person is still in the Center for the Enforcement of Legal Consequences of the Distinguished Persons.
Indemnities for contributions to books
Social works considered in programmes such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrants may not be finished where to record serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda reported.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although construction programmes have progressed so far, they are in a situation of risk, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed the 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that, in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State is responsible for providing 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end they have given us nothing, even though since July they had to give us a part of it," he said, "and we, in order not to record any delays, have started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the administration of the State had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to work and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we had to get the resources to cover what the state had not paid," he explains.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management to ensure that the corresponding percentages arrived as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have given us nothing."
The Court valid "analogue cut" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the more important changes the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the House of Deputies formulated against the presidential decree that preceded the so-called "analogue cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes needed to invalidate it were not brought together.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The proposed award, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulations on radio and television are a statutory assignment to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in breach of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversy to challenge the decree and admit the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions that the decree provides for for the digital transition.
The Ministers' plenary meeting also decided to reject the complaint made by the House of Deputies, without discussing the draft for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister-President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in that the Federal Executive cannot structure measures through general standards to ensure that the public administration prepares for them.
"I also believe that the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected if it did so," he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of the government's leadership.
The substitution of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years and this results in better operation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He argued that postponing change would delay the benefits of digitalisation, which involves a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "requires the operation of a whole system which, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of powers which the Constitution grants to the faculty of the State Executive".
He recalled that many countries in the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of Congress in one form, as it ensures in the administrative sphere the respect of the laws issued by the Legislative Authority, it ensures.
Analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to PREP data, the difference between the first and second place in the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of the count "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the election trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data shown by the Program of Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP), the difference between the first and second place of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting for the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, in the past 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal reform of electoral matters.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve either its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of State or its Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period for this electoral trial to enter into force and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed to publish it within the time limits provided for in the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same 9th of November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Authority and described the vote of the state representative for constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" because he does not have the right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the IEM General Council it will be possible to achieve partial and total votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial countdown of votes, one or more electoral packages, may be: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of the voting and there is no record of the ballot in the ballot box; or there are obvious errors or alterations to the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all ballot ballots in the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the supposed winning candidate and the winner of the election in the second ballot is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the party representative and/or coalition who submitted the second of the nominated candidates.
The total countdown of the vote may also be achieved if, at the end of the common count, the difference between the supposed winning candidate and that of the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate has come out second, in which case the electoral packages which have been the subject of the partial countdown will be excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without recording the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be spread in the siera of Zapalinamé, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive at Saltillo, his home town, on Sundays to the night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem missing.
According to his family, the lieutenant-colonel's last will was that his ashes be spread in Zapalinamé's siera.
After receiving tributes to others who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel arrived at the watchman's chapel of the boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends travelled.
At 5:30 p.m., he was paid tribute to the Saltillo Technological Institute, which was organized by his former colleagues in the field of technology and the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was a member when he was preparing for the bachelor's degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and his ashes were spread in the siera of Zapalinamé, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all her dreams, she considered him to be at the fullness of her life, "he had success, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a affectionate brother and well cared for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés abandoned the town of Saltillo very young to register at the College of Air in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people couldn't believe it, because they said he even had a problem with the truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was 7 years old he travelled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, for that he knows that his uncle died by doing what he loved most in life: driving an aircraft.
His last farewell
With honours, we have said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, who led the Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Saltillo Technological Institute, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished both in studies and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, along with the Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all officials of this service.
The remains of the driver Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to the members of the Air Force Mexican, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the planad of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his brothers and other parents, students and masters.
Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes involving organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered with shots fired in different parts of the body and with the stroke of grace, in an abandoned property of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at kilometre 1.5 of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who went through this location observed that in the property, whose fence is beige and coffee color the portal was largely open.
Looking inside, approximately three metres, they located the corpses of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on its side there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At one meter distance there was another person's body with a red T-shirt and blue-colored jeans.
The three were spread over the belly.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people were murdered in another location, because no in situ casings were found.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by a crime group organized towards the other, with the exception of a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence made the presentation of 11 persons, among whom was a minor, who was part of a criminal group that was mainly operating in the Cadereyta township and who were considered to have a relationship with sequestration, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and illegal burials.
According to the information published, eight people were arrested in the Los Alveros colony on November 11, and one who had been deprived of liberty was saved.
They were confiscated three buildings and one cell; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another fact that took place on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel conducted a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later on and after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the soldiers.
They are assigned illegal burials in General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that put Italy on the edge of the economic disaster
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that put Italy on the edge of the economic disaster and put the entire Eurozone at risk.
A press release from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a firm composed in his majority by technocrats, even if he is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the President the outcome of his discussions with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner of Journalists.
Monti did not explicitly state that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well designed," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels that cannot be supported.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard package of austerity required by European leaders to regain confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to move forward, the instability of the markets placing the yield of the Italian BTP obligations at 10 years above 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian boss Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support this government very much".
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this state of emergency.
Monti's chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, to which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
PDL's support, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began its consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations on Monday.
He will finish his meeting tour on Tuesday at night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short delay at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should persist until the future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite general predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement reforms before the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should only be trained by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources reported that reciprocal distrust and disagreement between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of Spanish is greater than that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 players from Spain, 10 participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, compared to the 22 convened by both countries for today's friendly at 3:05 p.m. at the Stade National de San José.
While national and European champions, number one of FIFA's monthly rankings, record a large register of class A inter-election games, only the Tricolor has the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish football players who play in the League of Stars and powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense year-round activity in league championships and national Cup championships and European Cup fights such as the Champions League.
To all this we have to add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated playoffs of the European Cup and the World Football World.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have limited international experience to an area, such as the Concaf, which is considered to be a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the greater record of the Spanish Selection is that of the goaltender Íker Casillas, who on Saturday previous against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalled the former goaltender Andoni Zubizarreta's record, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play against the Tricolor today and they will impose a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain wheel, is 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centennials of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the forecentre of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Ready for centenary number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the scorer Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have exceeded the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest can't even happen at 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not yet starting.
The historic winner of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its turn to celebrate two deaths of trajectories
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament, from Pearl Jam, said that the band is ready to offer one of his best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group ensures that for them it will also become a dream come true in this country.
It is that the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva of Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-time work-kill tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day will be held at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles Group The X and the Las Robertas Nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose complete transcript is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will take place in Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been grandiose.
I spent only once on vacation in Costa Rica; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it makes us feel like we're wearing our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the group, fans live intensely in the previous days.
What is your message for your most fierce followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Is that adding some pressure to your visit.
Some of the bigger shows we've offered over the past 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We have offered two giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned it, through the genes that love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never happened there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to do the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What's that supposed to be?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that's why it's very difficult to choose which songs to interpret each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't interpreted for a long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us why we liked these songs and that we can have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting to us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting to people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectories.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us had imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together makes a lot of emotion.
We love and love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world to which we have always wanted to go.
Things could not be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of great groups.
We are very friends with people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is not common.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with all of them and it's an honor for us to form part of this Seattle sound that came out.
It is also very strange that a group like yours keeps united and with the same members for so much time.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to be alive and, second, we all worry about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to that there are musical boulevards that give freedom to everyone to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and it could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you strike a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time touring because it's easy to fall into this game of great multitudes and people who like your music.
If we don't forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect music and what brought it, without putting the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which is not really interesting to any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We have been a group for almost three years and we have not released a disc before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There has been a lot of frustration about the fact that it lasted so little and most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it has always been a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
Las Robertas National Group will open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose him for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we loved most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and that must be very dissuasive.
What do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live for?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bass player, what are his influences?
There's so many...
Among the first to remember is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge relevant despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the bands I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who emerged at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's a music that's worth listening to and the bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music ever.
In the beginning, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What's the deal with this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe, which are called very obscure songs, even if they can sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them, and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose to a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and music and those songs, no doubt, represent this for me.
I also think we can be happy, and even so we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori re-hospitalized for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength that he presents in the pies, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who served a sentence of 25 years of imprisonment for human rights violations committed during his Government (1990-2000) suffers from various conditions, including language cancer, for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told TV channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of force in its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of surrender for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
It has been operated four times on language cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosional gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney calculations, blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, listed the physician.
Fujimori has been serving the lockdown since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron that operated illegally during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official cortège, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of various ministers and patrons, will launch a visit to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political themes in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propice for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French representative, Nicolas Sarkozy, included South America on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community the countries that continue to be tax havens, a declaration that caused the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador from that European country.
Mexico had presided over the G20 since November, a group formed from the stronger emerging and developed countries of the world, and had in force with the South American country, since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years to accelerate the implementation of tax exchange agreements to emerge from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 with a Free Trade Treaty (TLC), which has increased the trade of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plumber passes to the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, untiring, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil Bowser's grips, but he had never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month at the stores of everyone, has been designed from the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how to work stereoscopy without glasses," said Nintendo's specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game by Nintendo originally designed for this support", because so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a quick and fluid part.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second turn" at game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and "do not fall short of optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that had not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo takes a look at the followers of the saga and repeats the formula for the success of previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustachu plumber has to travel through mined platforms of peril to free Princess Peach.
Even though I find new things in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom goes after Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of 70 million US dollars.
Thus ends the trial so that Guatemala responds to the request of the northern country that required Portillo to judge it.
In a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive power, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office "he had not helped" in any court resolution and he had given course to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done presupposes an executive step after having exhausted all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former agent for the 2004-2004 period.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and after having guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for diverting funds of Q120 million from the Ministry of Defence when he was president, who was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Department appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinidad helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was created to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The balance sheet of the first 25 years of life of the Trinity Social Support Unit is important: 6,000 youth at risk of exclusion have been assisted to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of the century.
In addition to this, the long one hundred-year working hours currently obtained by this social group are also included.
The birthday was used yesterday to take stock of an act celebrated in a former Fabra i Coats industrial complex in which more than 300 people attended.
Trinidad Vella was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping low-skilled, unemployed people with substance abuse or marginalized problems.
The celebration yesterday in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of officials of entities and institutions who, within 25 years, have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinidad.
Along with the President of the Regional Government of Catalan (Generalist), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the act was attended by the former Socialist Minister of Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former Deputy Mayor to the Mayor and the current Municipal Eco-Socialist Advisor Ricard Goma.
The current Minister of Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and La Caixa's Charity Director General, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the Grand Hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinidad was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also so, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinidad as an example to be able to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by Squatters for Micro-Festivals, evacuated
The invaders were suitable for 11 of the 13 apartments in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare of the residents of Street Balmes' 51 lived has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned the building they occupied illegally at noon yesterday, where they organized micro-partys that were desperate for neighbours, in court order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation repeating.
"From now on there will be access control," said the administrator.
The Squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and part of the water, except to paint the walls and leave residues there of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass holidays, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for the tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also laid aside.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, her business fell by one 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him disloyal, because they sold the glasses to three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation area had to respond to the complaints of neighbours for noise, while according to the latter, the troubles were not caused by the discotheque clients, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irrigated neighbours of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the troubles were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since he "forgives" the rent.
Guardia Urbana (municipal police) has also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from neighbours about this situation.
The president of the Municipal PP Group, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end with the problems of common life and civility caused to the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last months the squadrons had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there have been flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end impunity and be implacable against the anti-social behavior generated in the property".
Yesterday, too, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police moved to Rue Mont-ral's 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the opportunity of convening beyond polemics on honours
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Around the mid-1980s, in the midst of the already extinguished Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), the Administration printed promotional posters from Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also had a numerical comparison with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not lean on the north-south axis, if not high (montagne) - low (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is to the benefit of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park if not Yellowstone, with straps in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
A door gives the idea of park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared all alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organisation and in terms of the reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all the architects in Barcelona.
It's almost a recurring theme, of which two members of this former caste of elect speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is opportune.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because the speech by Ildefons Cerda, that of the past of green houses, was not completed.
"It must be from the base that Barcelona's wider park is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the verdict gave the architect for whom the title "ports of Collserola" contains a "lexic trap": they should not be thought of as "access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which action must be taken".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some peril".
Perils that differ from "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and that had in the area of the Forum "his singing of swans".
The first fear is the delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step", i.e., its overrun.
"We need to think of new urban instruments, planning, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can cause authentic disasters."
By holding on to the question, Modol opts that by simplifying the El Valles de Collserola region "may be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat of Collserola which "does not have to be lost", thanking the mayor for the opportunity that the corporation offers to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, it means that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the exception that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "tweet" if this technical profile should direct the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he says) that we have to create: "We, the architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona believes that the answer to the question that gives the title of this room is complex, because the bases of the contest lack a global vision of Collserola: "There have been called 16 cross-country competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is not a longitudinal reading that leads and understands the area as a whole".
This makes it, at least in this case, that he chose to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project will allow one of the doors to shock the program and define it with that of the architect of the adjacent door.
In its opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately superior to that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal basis of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal power of Casino Red has been established, giving him forgiveness in the Second District Criminal Court, which will proceed with a trial for blackmail against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack of the Royal Casino, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic quote so that the Mayor of Monterrey allowed the illegal operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the Mayor of Paniste, and on 2 September he was arrested and held in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Ministry Agent 3 of Heritage Délits, he was transferred to Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was given a second order of detention after the Public Prosecutor's Office had dismissed the crime of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Cadereyta Criminal Center allegedly for singing with a million and a half pesos the owners of Casino Red; but he spent only a few hours in the middle security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, a catch order was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal Tribunal of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as that relating to the cashing of 1.5 million pesos of the game house's representatives in exchange for its operation.
This Monday, the foundation of the legal power of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself to Justice José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could regain his liberty in the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, Ramiro Arias, the officer of the Public Prosecutor's Office attached to the Tribunal, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who the partners of the gambling house had been the one who granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
According to case 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and no claim concerning the trial against him can be filed at a later stage; no compensation or punishment will be sought against him.
After the hearing of the foundation of the legal power of the playhouse, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and that his case would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the immediate order of liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and others lost his life
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and others lost his life indicate that the helicopter had directly shocked the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the soil, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so the unit met the requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations in the impact area did not report the appearance of ground parts.
"In one search it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the transport requirements.
The soil had a slope of seven to 30 degrees.
For the time being, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may last a few months, it may even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeroports and Auxiliaries, assured that the moment of impact, the state-presidential helicopter was operating at a speed of crucifixion, and this happened on a smooth, rising ground.
"This information supports the assumption of normal operation crucify at impact," he says.
During the press conference, the TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual volume:
According to the aeronautical normative, the flight was performed according to visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and at the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM referred to adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft moved towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-height nebulosity layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that, due to conditions of nebulae, the crew sought a lower height area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably prior to the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersal of aircraft remnants in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a right and side path.
The residual dispersion model of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter hit the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No traces of fire or explosion were detected:
In the disaster site there are still no traces in the remains of an aircraft type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple ground contacts.
During field work parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand,200 feet above the average sea level, the ground had a slope that has been going since seven degrades at 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After careful search in a wider area than the surrounding area, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found around the accident, which supports the presumption that the impact took place under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance conducts an investigation to discover the genes of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, known as the Protocol 'Genetics of Obesity for Children and Adolescents', which will allow for the overweight markers.
In a press release, Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry, Hospital of Specialities of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants had been formed.
This team is supported by third-cycle specialists and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Investigation and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) from the National Institute for Polytechnics (IPN).
In the investigation, it is invited to participate in the population with or without a right to participate in the sports units participating from IMSS in Valle de México, where evidence is provided to minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He pointed out that the protocol had begun in the Sporty Unit Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October the activity took place in the Sporty Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the target of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sportive Independencia (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sportive Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and the objective of this investigation is to recognize the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for children and young Mexicans in order to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As will be celebrated on 14 November on the World Diabetes Day, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of the specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their history of family inheritance of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or renal failure.
It was detailed that on Saturdays, all participants in anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (researching to identify people associated with childhood obesity) will be applied.
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years there was an increase in obesity of 77 per cent for boys and 47 per cent for girls, and a dramatic increase in overweight was also observed,' stressed the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search of markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from the others by its genetic history.
He informed that, on average, Mexicans have 65 percent of Indo-American inheritance, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics result in the inability to flush the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants is the full assessment of children, which helps to determine whether they are overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic and even pre-diabetes disorders.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and physicians provide it to parents in writing, to which each of the measures and changes they must make in order to prevent disease are explained.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use transportation instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamals - meat paste with corn flour wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM Asphalt Avoids Cassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher at UNAM's Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with a better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the paved was resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cassis each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of building and maintaining the tarp is adequate, the cassis could be completely reduced or even eliminated.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory of which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to that of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some northern cities of the country, to improve the yield, and therefore the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbons, molecules with heavier molecular weight, called asphalts, and molecules with lower molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the paved its viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt is that at high temperatures of nearly 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it has a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes causative, it added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on the environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible paved consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and compacted later.
Each of the little stones that forms the layer, it signals, is bathed in an asphalt year.
When vehicles pass through it by generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well in the paved.
If we had modified asphalt, it would spread better, and the chemical engineer would.
On the asphalt layer, he says, a final layer is placed called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
As the part of the paved that receives and distributes the efforts, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made of must be treated.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially water, as they significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil wets, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult to get it out, which brings back all layers of the paved and therefore causes cassis.
In the process of formation of a cassis, he says, the first one that breaks down is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System explained that the vehicle load is another important factor for the formation of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of the paved must always be linked to the load of the vehicle and guarantee its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent formation of cassis.
Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still much to be done to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which already exist on the market in other countries and allow for easy repair of cassis without having to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna to not win Miss Colombia's crown.
Valle receives her title number 14 from Princess.
Again, Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the winner's podium, wearing the crown of money and the band that accredits him as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico was mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the department already 14 titles of Princess and Melina was one of a legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today, the big question that many people are asking is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favourite that was shown in each presentation that she had everything to do with the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Visage Pretty of Vogue, of the titles obtained by the Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision of the juror of the First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? put by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the reply of the candidate from Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I think enough in literature, I think it's a form of cultivation, I think the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Bleeding of Blood".
This answer did not please firstly because of the term "culture" and secondly not to explain in concrete terms how each cited book had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony said that she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what should happen is happening.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Between the assumptions launched there is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota has insinuated that being the favourite, the octopus and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (the challenge of Easter gastronomy, the public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "she awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen, and that's why she didn't flash on the scene".
And it was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the crowning.
Although the two parades seemed to be sure of themselves, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" (Home of the House), of the RCN Canal, said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who receives most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the crown of queen".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has not been able to convince the jury of its interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Competition of Beauty.
That is why, two days before the election, International Jurée Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a committed woman with regard to her country's social needs.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, we must look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before the Competition begins is already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculating that Valle has sinned because of her defects from her back and the fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The Queen's Preparator Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in fact for me had not been too famous, left him points on the last day".
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos considered that the mistake of the Valle candidate was the surgical interventions she had received.
"Surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of this aspect".
For this award, which the National Competition of Beauty gives for the first time, after the swimsuit parade arose a cruel prediction that was accomplished last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina so as not to give him the taste of the crown.
Real or not, the truth is that Melina is starting today a year of reign, not as sovereign, or otherwise as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designating the National Competition.
However, she will go into history as one of the queens who, despite her stunning passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali dactyloscopic has gone to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November 4 a typoscopyist from the CTI in Cali went to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopics who work in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the turn of the "availability" of Eliaszar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the Chocó towns, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place where the dead were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after having followed appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of frictional skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar had been warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter in Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected of being the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to take the map with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the body's site, he did not recognize it by his physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a farmer in the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian loupe, ink, a predator and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the one who confirmed to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the Supreme Chief of the Farcs.
Looking for the print
For a dactyloscopist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González in a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
Apart from identifying corpses, dactyloscopicists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide, and confirm the identity of the individuals captured.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher noted that in a case of flight he had to remove part of a wall from a house, because in that place the thief had backed his hand to get out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the full hand print and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.
The prints may also remove or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently a dead man was found with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a parent might be suspect of the crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
Even if it does not guarantee that he is the murderer, it places him on the scene of the crime.
A ITC dactyloscopic explained that "the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents" are extracted.
When they appear, a bearer or a band is used to pick them up.
Later, the prints were sent to Asif, the database of the declines, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," the ITC expert reported.
He explained that not everything is shown in the CSI television program.
As all that shines isn't gold, everything you touch doesn't become a print.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indignants" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters marched in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
Much of the people have responded to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Okcupe Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to re-enter, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Great Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were marching in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to gain access through a judicial order that allowed the 'indignant' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp in the square again, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," says one of the spokespersons of the "Occupe Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the 'indignants' to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indigned' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested a few protesters, even though Bray could not confirm the actual number, by making sure Ephe saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved in support of members of the movement and has tried to intervene in favour of them before the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property facility - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday, during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analysed.
Some displaced protesters carried and distributed copies of this judicial order at that time and even delivered it to the officers who were watching the place, which caused 'some minor clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials hit the protesters.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of Okcupe Wall Street or from applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or prohibiting demonstrators from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they used before'.
Mayor Bloomberg informed the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the demonstrators, to which he warned, however, that local laws did not allow them to settle with tents and bags to sleep.
The municipal councillor personally defended the evacuation at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided on because the demonstrators 'violated the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the square because it became "a place in which people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases to harm others", because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"This morning's evacuation at dawn has been repugnant and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the movement's spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
"Occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they did not think to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television program of Noel
Along with Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be on the TV program "It's at Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", a wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Noel on Canadian television.
The CTV private television channel today announced that Android, alongside the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadian, will release in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on the next 1 December interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide internet distribution of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband from that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed like the Virgin Mary, supporting in a creche a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Indian Canadian actor who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appeared come Joseph.
Next to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special program for Noel also presents Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and is not far from the controversy itself.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan fell after the earthquake
GDP rose 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ended the decline spiral in early March
Since March the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, convalescent again after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, Japan's worst disaster since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo Government have calculated the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have slowed down.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September were used to finally turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and an annualised rate of 6%.
In addition, the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - assumes the highest rate of increase since January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and post-tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared with the decrease of 0.9% of capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructure, use the shortcomings to believe in zero.
Japan has awakened mainly as a result of developments in domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "values refuge" elected by investors who fled the debt crisis in the euro zone and the disordered forecasts of the United Nations, a privilege that weighs like a deal in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low results between July and September for the yen's contribution.
While markets continue to be based in peripheral countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not fall guard.
"It is necessary to follow the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that the majority of member countries presented clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the ambiguities of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being held back.
For it has lowered four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8. in August.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is in level 100, with eight decimal places falling to 99.13 points.
Athens once again raises doubts
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservative will not sign a written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to immerse itself in the labyrinth leading to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos yesterday reported that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the one-hundred-day period established in his designation may be short to apply, the leader of the Conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his requirement for new elections for the planned date, the date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October," said Papadimos when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate which will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to stimulate employment, the reform of the Public Servants' Disciplinary Code and the new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras's message casts doubt on his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more".
The Conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8,000 million Athens needs urgently, and made it clear that he would not approve any letter of commitment to implement the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the go-all of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is made: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as early as possible".
The Spokesperson for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines Spain's "predominant" position with regard to this type of finance
Spain has "achieved a world-leading place in the role of microfinance".
Queen Sofía recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the world's second donor with regard to this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all mankind, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and "very especially in the case of the one that aims to reduce half the volume of people living with incomes below one dollar a day, to which the "poverty threshold" is set."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all parts of the world, and assume this task with "responsibility", reported Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating during the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "will guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved a lot of goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which "two basic goals" must be driven.
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have joined these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Queen Sofía as a "act of justice and recognition due".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she had known since 15 years ago when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have been able to see a continuous evolution at each meeting", explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualification of "head of family" gathered in Valladolid on behalf of the "banger of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in finding solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethic Imperative"
The Minister for External Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she explained that it would be a mistake to vinculate cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, because it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits imply "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to poverty eradication", and now "more than ever" developed country governments must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of the compressions.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to those "excluded to whom all are closing the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its contaminated doors of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democrat Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without any real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also president of the Christian-Democratic party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned for the programme but was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the activists who judge the government's policy too laxistic to the Greeks today and perhaps to the Italians tomorrow.
The motion for a resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Directorate-General, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The stand was held for several minutes, to which Angela Merkel, after their speeches, then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very European Minister for Finance, was entitled, did not leave room for doubt.
The idea of the chancellor - and the motion - holds a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "time has come from a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty which would strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but which could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal vote "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is in any case one of the motion's proposals adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh each country's weight on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which, of course, meant increasing the weight of Germany.
To ease the climate within its party, the chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl But she has also not sought to win her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty promptly to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except for the hollow.
Recalling that two centuries ago Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud at the time of illness?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and to deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of combating social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which is based on a desire to save money in a rigorous context, but which is no less an announcement of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on disease arrests.
First of all, for the purpose of budgetary savings: the government plans to impose a fourth day of default on private employees before a stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' salary, thus at least 15% of his or her monthly income.
A measure that is likely to cause anger, but which would allow for an increase of EUR 280 million, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: to impose on public servants a day of unremunerated default in the event of termination of work (they have so far no delay of default, as against three days in private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also revitalizes the theme of fraud, this time targeting the abuses related to job breaks.
"Controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will pay back," warned Xavier Bertrand on the micro of RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As with other cases, the effects of advertising seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of job-stop fraud.
This has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than they are in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million of daily allowances were granted in 2006.
According to the Institute of Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily allowances in 2008 amounted to 5% of health expenditure, with €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% related to sick leave, or EUR 6.2 billion.
And thus 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French averaged 14.5 working days, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not stopped sick.
Another study, this time of sickness insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no longer inclined to stop work.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France was between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave is very low in the face of work in the dark.
As for fraud, it reaches only a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic monitoring of disease arrests for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of 285,000 short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of stops over 45 days, systematically controlled, there were 11% "unadapted or unwarranted" cases over 1.2 million, or 132,000.
A total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million workers who have had a sick leave.
A figure that is very little faced, for example, with that of work to the black.
According to MP UMP Dominique Tian, who was the author of a report on the subject in June, the latter would represent between EUR 9 and 15 billion in tax revenue per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papadémos: Greece will have to apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to correct its economy.
That is what the Prime Minister, Lucas Papadémos, said to Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the one hundred days given to his Union government would not suffice to accomplish this task.
"To continue the economic recovery effort, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the head of government, who gave his first public address at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the Eurozone is "at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos anticipated that the country's public deficit would be reduced to around 9% of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the right-wing leader, gave his support to the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not engage in any further austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and combating waste, but opposed any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his speech was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says an expert committee
Canadians Live in Denial of Death, according to the Report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when necessary, with a patient who is deemed to be competent to make such a decision.
From the beginning of the game, the experts quote a recent survey of the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death".
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, Quebec has the highest rate, with 86% of deaths occurring at the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report arrive at conclusions that run counter to the federal government's position, which has already said does not want to change the Criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where such approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide assisted by non-competent or unconsenting persons.
On the contrary, yesterday in the teleconference Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, there would be more cases of such spillovers precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assistant suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
It is recalled that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it would enable people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the life of the elderly or the disabled has less value.
As for persons who committed assisted suicide, the respondents estimate 41% that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or cessation of care for a patient, the situation is less clear, says the authors of the report.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Expert Committee also calls for health care professionals to be trained to respect a refusal of end-of-life care without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations regarding the findings of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, has described the position of the experts who sign the report as "extremely" because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the patients in the terminal phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which everyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old could ask for help in suicide," said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the person's autonomy above all other values that contribute to the social fabric of society.
Now, "in society," he says, there are tags and constraints."
The Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests in particular the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a "complotation"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Proponents of Bachar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry premises.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, with Russia's support, resists them and denounces a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a stand in favour of President Assad leaving.
Yesterday King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad to "quite power" in Syria, where about 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were still killed.
"If Bachar had a deep interest in his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime had failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country in which Turkey is adopting an increasingly tough line.
On their part, the United States welcomed the "enforcement of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, of countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly tough tone in the face of repression in Syria," said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces died in the region of Deraa, in southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights (SHR).
Two other civilians perished in the city of Homs, according to this NGO, of "exchanges of guns and pillage of heavy machine guns in Jobar".
However, at a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moullem felt that the country was "dividing towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly responded to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus's work, which he believed constituted a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not bend," he added, ensuring that "the hardis plot against Syria will fail".
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also expressed support for the sending of United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he believed was contained in the "paranoia".
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to review the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces of the cities to challenge and release the arrested protesters.
Yesterday, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, found the Arab League's decision to be "wrong", while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, while maintaining its support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for market time and sacrifices in Italy
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time in the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today with the trade unions and employers.
It should set up a relatively small firm consisting of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti talked about an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, Member of Parliament for one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the interviews, after meeting with the President-designate of the Council.
The President of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he expects Mario Monti to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a small list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for preparing a government and its program, he stressed, saying "certainly that markets will be patient and understand".
Its appointment by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern resumed, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should be a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politicals".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, when the next legislation was put in place, he said.
According to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti, once in office, undertook to work in an emergency and with the aim of "re-emerging" Italy in Europe.
A spokesperson from European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary equilibrium objective in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further rigorous measures.
The Italian patron saint Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot comply with deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, known for his competence and his independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy is expected to place EUR 200 billion of state bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, said an American NGO specializing in atomic risk on Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
Last week the IAEA expressed its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades since the 1960s in a Soviet nuclear centre in Cheliabinsk (Oural), and had been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the centre to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated in the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system "has been assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only well aware of this technique, but, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked during his most important career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence has slightly decreased or little progressed, according to the FBI's published statistics on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49%, compared with a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of hate crimes rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," said Human Rights First, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a press release.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be seen as a serious violation of human rights," added one of the organization's officials, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," he added, believing that this could lead to an improvement in police reports on "hate crimes".
The "crime of hatred" in US federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence related to race, skin colour, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter micro-blogging site introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday, allowing its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to follow more legibly, live the activity of the other "Twittos", the Internet users who follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know whether they are sending messages, whether they are signing up for new accounts, whether they have favorite messages, etc.
This new form of Twitter was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast throughout the network Monday, told the AFP Twitter Spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to redistribute a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the initiates happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the public Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network, users were suddenly discussing "tweets" cut off on the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it's too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter feed," sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
inclusion of a "golden rule" in the Constitution
The government of the large social-democratic/Christian-Christian coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "gold rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any deterioration by the rating agencies of the sovereign note of Austria (triple A).
It is the social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% maximum criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was reduced by only one single stake, from AAA to AA+, we should pay an additional three billion euros each year," argued Vice Chancellor and Christian-Democrat Minister for Foreign Affairs Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus responding to a request from the summit in Brussels from the euro area Member States on 26 October: then the Heads of State and Government had requested the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the federal government's structural government deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the regional states and the municipalities will have to present budgets to balance.
The objective is to bring public debt below the 60% criterion laid down in the Maastricht Treaty to 2020/21.
Yen Fort
Noda threatens new intervention on the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, explained Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose from the historical levels that led the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive yen against dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just established a new record in power since 1945 in the face of the green note.
But the yen has come back regularly since, baptized by purchases of investors who consider it a "value refuge" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar retreaded under the 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro descended under the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-09 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This flash of the Japanese currency is damaging to the archipelago's exports as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign earnings from Japanese companies when they convert them into national currency.
" Japan's struggle to rebuild" since the earthquake and the 11 March tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda who feared that this yen price increase would kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The third world economic power has recovered with growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent from the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a resurgence in the exports and consumption of households led by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister found that the yen's dearness did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", suggesting that no further monetary flexibility was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion), increasing the ceiling for purchases of various financial securities to 55,000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) to the level of the liquidity market.
Euro zone:
the rates are rising, the stock exchanges are going up
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis always undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are sinking a little further into the negative territory on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., ACC 40 lost 1.4% to 3.064 points.
Dax to Frankfurt gives up 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new tensions over the yields of euro area countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contamination," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, with renewed fears from market players about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a corridor of narrow variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been growing at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down from 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it declined after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion providing in particular for the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain very worrying.
This Tuesday morning, the return on Italian bonds at 10 years is 6.85%, the return on Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the stakeholders.
The leader of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time in the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in line with the markets, while Sunday's legislative elections are taking place in the country.
The spread of the 10-year obligation between Germany and Spain has reached a new higher historical level.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3% of households' consumption.
However, the number of the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) instead of a stagnation, has been revised downwards.
And, it is really the fourth that concerns the economists most.
Germany, for its part, recorded a 0.5% increase over the same period.
An initial estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m. whereas the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must prevail over dogmas
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the guise of emotion, it is indeed energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a good thing that an election is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and not on nuclear issues.
The debate will be successful only if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic change will double the demand for electricity by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to compensate for the sluggish nature of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity on a permanent basis, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case with Belgium, which is subject to the need to be able to find an alternative source capable of replacing itself, nor with Switzerland, which is just going to build only the last generation of power stations.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but one, pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, they, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by taking up the construction of a power plant interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German renewable energy model is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the speech.
Berlin's choice will result in higher electricity prices, an increase in energy dependence due to the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a surge in CO2 emissions due to the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months' time, all these bad effects have already been felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
Europe's wind energy champion, 30% of which he draws from his electricity, is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittance of the wind; hence, his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a more than 40% electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's least expensive electricity.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would result in a sharp rise in electricity prices, which would make the fine statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not object in principle to this energy, the polls show it.
It should be recalled that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410 000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it leads to a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets and makes them very non-replaceable job creators.
If France had decided to leave nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the annual EUR 6 billion in exports of nuclear equipment and services as a skin of grief.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to run for 60 years when his manufacturer's decline would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miraculous electricity, nor is there any diabolical.
The development by Areva of low-emission solutions of CO2, nuclear and renewables, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We have in France a Safety Authority that exercises intransigent and transparent control over the existing plants as on the construction site of Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same security obsession.
In half a century, the nuclear industry experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequence.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and of unforgivable human faults caused drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it had done for the past two years.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between safety authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians who want to build a power station, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift to Areva and EDF competitors by leaving them free to take leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from various angles - the management of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the numbering policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "country of human rights".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have made the latest news, the Minister of the Interior (Read Liberation of May 23) proclaiming that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
It is that there is a fairly broad consensus between the left and the right on this issue.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who stated in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate the whole misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared both on the left and on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be given to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is able to do so, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally paying; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book summarising the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limiting immigration anemia growth and employment.
The fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that migrants may replace national workers, especially the low skilled, with a downward pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mainly engaged in occupations in sectors in which there is a shortage of jobs.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the supply of employment.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants mean that immigrants' arrivals have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows results in an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of real wages in the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the US Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, an immigrant at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (receipts less expenditure) of 150000 euros to public budgets on average over the whole of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished, at the beginning of the mandate, to go and find the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, in order to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, still to think of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced during the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonists in Greece.
Some have believed that it would be enough for democracy to definitely triumph over its enemies to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little," that this was a facility of thought.
The universal vote, in order to be the necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient and can even be made an "instrument of oppression" as used to be said by Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public mind, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, and justice.
The crisis in Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinodia of the true Greek referendum in this regard has had the value of double revealing: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the feeling disturbing of its inability, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought of to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved now, and for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in dispersal order.
A white-seing to the absolute European monarch or a step-by-step jump in the vacuum of the nationalist retreat: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts, but a common exercise, of full right, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we could no longer stop the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that is clinging to the dictatorships of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgent task is to restore to popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
It is together that Europeans can reduce their debt burden, free up markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except, of course, to lead us to disaster.
After fighting this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors for a long time, everyone today is demanding the European economic government.
- Yeah. - Yeah.
But thinking about it without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new deadlock.
We must take a new step in European construction.
To do the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" Republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a true European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, we make Europeans.
Non-contact smart cards are common
The world-wide smart card salon opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
In fact, 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% in the world's sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card, etc.), to more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart firm.
The most important segment is that of uncontacted technology that makes it possible to pay for public transportation or pay for its purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million uncontacted smart cards should be sold around the world, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent almost 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards).
For a long time behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for uncontacted payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa without contact cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double plugs.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million Pass MasterCard cards without contact.
To speed up, banks now need to equip their customers.
"In the future, two large French institutions have committed themselves to systematically distributing to their customers bank cards equipped for no contact," announces Gérard Nebouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment by mobile
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to carry out transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally know a real growth next year."
"We have sold 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012", explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case allowing payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project to Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the General Corporation, too, yesterday said to prepare the launch of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida and the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing relationship between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram is confirmed.
Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way in which the two organizations operate and the reports of the intelligence services show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the rapt of two French people in Niger last January would have brought to light bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day together with several of their enthusiasts in an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the debris of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
terrorist axis
The analysis of past calls points to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says himself near Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we may have to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"For years, it has been known that the sect has received external financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" had been increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and speeches or in his operating modes, which now involve the use of more and more complex kamikazes or explosive devices and the same invoice as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, is therefore under pressure from Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminants of little interest.
Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Islam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in haussa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the northern Muslim of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It Politizes and calls for strict respect for the sharia while its activists engage in the struggle against the impious central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active, increasing the number of attacks against the police.
Abuja's reaction, as usual, is without nuances.
The army is investing in the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
The sect will therefore radicalize and leave its fiefs from the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another one in Abuja.
In June, it was still in Abuja that Boko Haram took part in the police's secure QG during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the UN headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would navigate from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now a concern for all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, while the Somalis of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned Boko Haram and said he was ready to share all the information.
The world according to Republican candidates for the presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe that.
Over the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied the toneless statements and short-cuts in foreign policy, traditionally a strong republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often unstacked - were used.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese in front of the WTO and to challenge them "for the manipulation of their currency", a theme bearing in an America exaggerated by the migration of whole parts of its industry to Asia.
So long as it must involve the start of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to Obama's China and only candidate to have a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, has almost stunned himself against an attitude that "flats" the emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is staggering in the depth of the polls, remains unsound.
Like Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll arrest Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows him an embarrassing ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "trys to develop nuclear capability" - apparently unaware of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Governor Texan Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, said he was prepared to engage the US army in Mexico against the cartels of drugs.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavy truck in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in terms of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, on the premature departure of the "boys" of Iraq, on his vagaries in Libya, thus attaching a weak label to him.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population is quite positive about Obama's national security record, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been distrustful of military interventions leading to the closure.
And, arguing that America must be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
North Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, connecting Western Europe directly to Russia through the Baltic Sea, entered service.
It must provide gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a spark.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part, last Tuesday, on the Baltic coasts, between the orchestra and the end buffet, in the inauguration of Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects Russia directly under the sea with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have taken together the wheel of the valve commander the entrance of Russian gas into the western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first 1 224 km tube linking the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is due to be completed by the end of 2012, allowing a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas to be delivered, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we already mention the possibility of building a third one on the same path.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction has air of victory.
The project had been strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
North Stream will be able to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries then lose a little power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to the western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare North Stream with a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of energy Europe, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In barely five years, Russia has been able to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas consumers, and whose deposits are declining.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon by opening this gas pipeline, demonstrating how important the gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles shown by Gazprom's leaders, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical exploitation.
The underwater tube is made of concrete-wrapped steel to protect it from anchors of ships.
It rests on the seabed, on average 200 m.
To build it, minefields dating back to World War II had to be avoided.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precautionary measure," says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts over its entire length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was planned outside Sweden, but project managers abandoned it while the Swedish were reluctant to see a Russian state company permanently established off their coasts.
"In case of a tart, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welds to escape every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the state of the pipeline is carried out by a submarine robot, carried by a ship, for external observation, and by a device operating inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide of one meter in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three complete days of travel at a speed of 3 meters a second, he provides accurate information on possible metal deformations.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without having to undergo the slightest repair.
The flow of gas is simply controlled by pressure.
It's 200 bars at the start, and 100 bars at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, holding 51% of the shares.
The German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream to build and operate the pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented the entire gas transport capacity to the company for 20 renewable years.
" Gazprom will pay for total capacity regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline was provided at 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their fees, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy pine coast.
Valves, 4.5 metres high, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificity of the gas coming before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a book of brands.
Founded about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
He has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine Carnet is easily recognisable, with its black rectangular cover, elastic, its leaves of a broken white colour, as old by time.
Yet the Moleskine Carnet, as we know it today, was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a book of design notes but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for launching the new product.
The carnet is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin, which is a varnished cotton used to cover banquets, for example.
This type of book was very popular with writers and travellers.
"Moleskine gave to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the 20th century ", says Maria Sebregondi, who has become the responsible of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million sold items.
We are far from confidential production in the early years, where only 3,000 carnets were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to establish a portrait-robot of the buyer, because the notebook of notes seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, has almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in the bookstores, from the Fnac to small downtown shops, and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of e-mails," says Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists display their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a Leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural will, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer covers... The brand is on a range of supports.
A success that has made envious: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskin's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy set up in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is even higher than the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the general population.
Discourageing?
"No," said Eric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled."
" Progress has been considerable for fifteen years. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two or three times higher."
"However, there is still a great deal to be done."
It must be said that for the disabled, there are still many obstacles before access to employment.
They are rather older: 37% are more than 50 years old (17%) on average.
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bac and out of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work, and which "are the crux of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's what we're doing for the target brakes.
Stay the unsaid, the attitudes that are changing, certainly, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Learning Association for the City indicated that the managers interviewed have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "a overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment objective of 6% of disabled workers, laid down in a 1987 law.
The latest figures, which date back to 2008, indicate a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of the Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on enterprises," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "Let you be happy"
Before fighting the Blues Tuesday night (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match provides them.
We will not go until we write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace.
Five months after the mood gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian selectionist has nothing but praise for doing about him.
"I am very pleased with Eden's progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to move forward", assures the Lillois on his side.
As to the contrast between his club and selection performances, "it's a whole thing, he justified himself."
"In Lille, I am there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Fighted against Romania Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "grill".
However, without forgetting the notion of "pleasing".
The Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a supporter," he says.
It also contributes to further strengthening the "special" nature of this meeting.
Especially in front of him, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he calls.
"We crossed right now."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
With kindness, Leekens referred, for his part, to "fearfulness".
"Fierté" de contester "un match de gala".
"Fierté" also noted - as "seen"- that France "recomes a very high-level team" just over a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a job of thunder," he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be well-shared with the Bleus direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians grow up," he stressed.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll be aware of this in the next matches." This one against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento is starting with a lot of optimists coming back to Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams had failed in realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, of which he has been in charge since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is indeed only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to get rid of.
In view of the game go (0-0), Friday in hell Zenica, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, certainly, but it was unable to mark this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk because we haven't scored a goal outside."
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of a public who should also be there boiling, even though the party obviously promises to be "very tight", tens a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We expect a very tight game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take over," said 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012", nevertheless relativized Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The nobody reported on Bosnia Friday forces the Portuguese to mark and win.
A nobody can do enough for the Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk because we haven't scored a goal outside," Bento regretted.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical skills and has players with a lot of individual skills," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to think."
A good idea, provided it's realistic this time.
