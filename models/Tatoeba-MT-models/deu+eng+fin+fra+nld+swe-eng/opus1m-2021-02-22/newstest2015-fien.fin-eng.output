The city of Juankoske joins the city of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The city council of Kuopio unanimously adopted the annex on Monday.
Juankoske City Council approved the annex last week.
The municipality of Tuusniem was also involved in the settlement of the municipal union, but the council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the execution of the following municipalities separately.
The next municipal elections will take place in 2016.
After Juankoske's accession, the population of Kuopio is approximately 111,000.
Indian and Japanese Prime Ministers meet in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi met his Japanese colleague Shinzo Aben in Tokyo to discuss economic and security relations, on his first major foreign visit after the May election.
The aim of the five-day visit to Japan by Modi is to strengthen economic relations into the third largest economy in the world.
The main topics for discussion are the plans for extended nuclear cooperation.
India has also said that it is interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the leadership of Kiev on Monday of refusing direct political discussions with the Separatists in eastern Ukraine.
At this moment, the government of Kiev does not want to conduct an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country, Putin said according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-minded Separatists, whose Kiev and the West say they are assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukraine's troops further away from their present positions where Putin said Ukraine's army was firing civilians.
The aim of the militias is to push away these armed forces and their cannons so that they will not be able to shoot the inhabitants of the area, Putin said.
The event was organised on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi repair shop.
It surprised me that the crowds came from the very beginning.
During two days there were expected visitors, the promoter Tom Kangas says.
The wall river Hiphop Festival was organised for the third time.
Next year again.
We're going to continue to be hip-hop festivals, i.e., the pop is not allowed to convince thekangas.
On Tuesday Finland will enter into force a law that will limit the acquisition of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, private individuals must apply to the Police Government for permission to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a source of explosives.
These substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitrogenic acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the specified levels are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is present in detergents and detergents, but concentrations do not generally exceed the limit values.
For example, nitromethane is used during acceleration.
However, materials acquired before the law enters into force may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster is charged with the hotel rape of Nairn and Pitlochry
The defendants of rape in two hotels are awaiting trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a hearing before the High Court of Glasgow.
He is charged with rape at Pitlochry's Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire Province on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman in "a state of unconsciousness, sleep, and thus unable to make a decision on her own".
Webster is also charged with the second rape at the Golf View Hotel in Upper Nairn on 4 May 2014.
In accordance with the decision of the Judge, Lady Rae, the trial will be held in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Super Raheem shone - Mario stayed in the shadow - Valoeliga - Night-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered to be the hope of the future of English football.
White Hart Lanella had an electronic atmosphere on Sunday when Mario Balotelli, who had strengthened Liverpool, arrived as a guest at Tottenham.
Super Mario’s first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw work done by a 24-year-old Italian on the field in a completely different position than in Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far from his top office.
The Italians lost three high-quality targets and only spent half of their six feeds on their own team.
The players who have already taken Pool as their favourite will expect better in the future.
Brendan Rodgers, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, placed Balotell in Barcelona as the second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge in the role of Luis Suarez.
As a star in the team, instead of Balotelli, I set the middle field of the diamond, Raheem Sterling, who finished a 3-0 win by the important opening goal of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, not just in power.
Balotellia is 20 cents shorter than a fish in the water, and the Englishman is between the lines of the opponent.
Property is not common to a player who will praise the grass at its best for a speed of about 34 km/h.
Rodgers also deserves great thanks from Sterling for its development.
After the match, the Irishman told us how Liverpool has systematically developed a more holistic player from a north-western pilot who grew up at Wembley’s roots.
Susanna Mälkki was elected master conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Council has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next master chapel of the Helsinki City Orchestra from autumn 2016.
The papers, along with the Los Angeles Times, have been asking what orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki tells us that she will start her new assignment with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in the music life of our country for over a hundred years, for example by presenting a large number of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has led the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation, she says.
Administrations of employee organisations in pension negotiations - Country - Regions - News - Karelian
Today's pension negotiations are seeking new impetus from the social partners' own meetings.
The governments of SAK, Ava and STTK will discuss the situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are to be continued.
The social partners have, among other things, undermined the dispute about the commitment of the retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by autumn, but according to the latest estimate it would be created during this week.
The pumice.
Rovaniemi women's football league Woman Volley stumbled to the Vampula Sports League in the finals of the training tournament on Sunday.
The vampire turned to five for a three-to-two stretch match.
The last lot of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was always ahead of the step.
The fight was good, but in the defense game and in the passport game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVon coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVon's hexagon was in the cross that 190-cent American centurion Jennifer Keddy was stuck in the back.
The center played Sara Niemi.
Karolina Kyllönen was the most powerful player in the game and formed the most powerful combination of WoVon and Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Mittemäki, who started the hacker, had to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 instalments.
The best part of the vampire was a skilled Russian passerby as well as libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, which WoVo circled as much as possible.
The preparation of the league will continue next week when Hämeenlinna HPK joins the training camp for Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "store" at 6 p.m. in the official training game.
On Sunday, they'll meet at the sports school again.
Lidl hides wild figures in Finland

The company released its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and enlargement is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that for the last financial year, taxes paid to Finland amounted to almost EUR 14 million.
Lidl Finland belongs to the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more common in sparsely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published a video in honour of her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas are more likely to die of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers reviewed the patient data of over 1100 Australians in 2005 for a woman with ovarian cancer diagnosis and found that only 35% of women, i.e. over five years after diagnosis.
The lead researcher Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas died 20 per cent more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
PENI RESEARCH: New medicines may slow down lung and ovary cancer
The researchers went through the history of women's health over the course of seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, at the time of diagnosis of a woman's age, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status had an effect on survival.
In older women and with cancer, the probability of survival at the time of diagnosis was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during research than women living in urban areas.
The study did not attempt to determine why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers possible causes of delayed diagnosis and difficult treatment.
"Special doctors of gynaecological oncology handle this disease best, and their reception is mostly in large cities," Jordan says.
Although distance treatment is becoming more widespread and the importance of distance is decreasing, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors in order to allow specialist physicians to treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programmes to support patients who are being treated from afar.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, the long-term survival rate of women with ovary cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, which underlines the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neavella, a family mother living in the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the parking plan in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel of Pohjanhov.
On Monday, the City Government decided that the proposal for the status of the Friendship Park and its nearby environment will be placed at the public service point of Osviitta.
The draft formula is requested from the Environment Board and the Lapland Ely Centre.
With a change in location, the city wants to make it possible for tourism-related motoring activities to continue in the area.
The site is intended to form a park area that includes the area between the current Friendship Park and the river.
During the period 15 November to 30 April, the proposal provides for a permanent maximum of 200 power-trains.
Tank points may also be placed in the area.
The new park area is also allowed for maintenance services.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the Friendship Park area for safari companies during wintertime.
The lease agreement was renewed in the last spring of 2014 and is in force in spring 2018.
There has also been strong opposition to parking activities and change of pattern.
The inhabitants of the neighbourhood compartments have been in their sleep, both in their voices and in their concerns about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been investigated and no findings beyond the indicative values have been identified.
Even the renewed equipment is much lower than the old ones.
The Friends Park, as a parking area, also supports the fact that, if the place of departure is moved further away, the hotel's safari customers should be transported to the safaris' places of departure by bus, which would be estimated to be 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area of the Friendship Park and its surrounding area are also sufficiently large, better than the places shown as replacement points, such as, for example, Ounasjoki's eastern bridge down the boatboat.
The Friendship Park is good for its location, too, so that in the future the activities can expand to, for example, the Ounaspaviljong region.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the urban strategy adopted by the City Council of Rovaniemi, which aims, inter alia, to create a good framework for business activities by providing sufficiently high-quality areas for logistically and functionally cheap locations.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiles in the city centre, which has not yet gained legal force.
The decline in owner-occupied dwellings is seen in the garden shops
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially in the group under 35, may lead to a decline in the turnover of garden sales by tens of millions, when today's young consumers reach the "main target group" on behalf of their age.
According to the Financial Times report, landlords spend only 55 per cent of the money they spend on gardening.
The study had also shown that more and more people live in highly urbanised dwellings with no gardens, and that the size of the garden is diminishing as the front floor is increasingly covered in parking places, which also threaten the garden area with an estimated value of about GBP 5 billion a year.
In the Greater London area, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, with the least money being spent on garden products per household in the whole country.
According to the HTA and the UK Garden Association (RHS), however, an increase in the rent of dwellings or a decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS's leading garden advisor, says that "for example, the plants grown in transferable breeding containers are particularly popular among landlords because such breeding containers can be included in the change if necessary".
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the flowering period in the garden sector, as housing and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will grow this year due to better weather conditions, since last year's weather was worse in March and April.
Turkey interrogates US diplomatic due to spying report
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey has invited the most experienced US diplomat to report on the spying of the United States and the British in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the United States Ambassador and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden of the United States National Security Agency (NSA) reveal Turkey as the main spying destination for the United States and Great Britain intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reduced the importance of the report, saying that all the major states have been spying on each other.
The previous report by the German General Intelligence Service on spying on Ankara gives the Turkish government a more angry reaction.
Cannes winner Croze appears in a new Finnish film
Marie-Josée Croze, a Canadian actor in many of the success films, has been attached to the majority of women in a new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Copperinen's film for 2 nights until the morning, the pictures of which will be launched this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the top female award of the Cannes Film Festival in her role in the 2003 Barbarian Invasion.
He has performed in the film of Steven Spielberg in Munich and in the film of Julian Schnabel in the glass cover of Perhone.
Two nights to the morning, the main man in the film is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will be given its first night in Finland in September 2015.
Major Magaluf of Mallorca on charges of corruption
The case revealed evidence that the police and Calvià City Government officials were under pressure from the Mallorcan Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Calvià Police Chief, on the island of Mallorca, has been arrested as a result of the corruption charges brought against the well-known Magaluf area’s movement and bar owners.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was held in custody after several of Punta Ballena's movement agents presented a corruption charge against him. Punta Ballena's street is located most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the case revealed evidence of the blackmail of police officers and Calvià City Government officials at the Mallorcan Anti-Corruption Office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police in connection with the corruption charges, and they are interrogating the judge together with Navarre.
ABC, a daily newspaper in the whole country, wrote about the partiality of the angry authorities of night clubs, which made their business very difficult.
"There is no more money in this case, but survival," one movement said to the court.
You won't destroy our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was on the headlines of the magazines this summer in several countries when the online YouTube video was broadcast, where an 18-year-old British vacationer had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawlin.
Since then, the island’s authorities have tried to curb the drugged and uncontrolled use of Magalufi’s vacationers by reducing the number of participants in bad-known, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse Cancer Club, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and Carnage was jointly ordered to pay the owner of the club and the pub crawlin organiser EUR 55 000.
Above all, among the young British tourists, its recommendation at Magaluf's tourist destination has also become popular as a so-called balconying trend, which has caused several alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from balcony to balcony or balcony to a hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and cranemen bombed their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools remained closed when the region recovered from battles.
The school opening caused joy and excitement in rocket bombardment in the communities of southern Israel, but the traces of fighting are still visible.
In the southern city of Ashdod, Pashosh day home, the workers removed the chips from the walls and slide before the children arrived at the rocket’s impacted day home.
"We are a little scared, but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in the Saad in a kibbuts, an Israeli community, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area need routines.
She's an 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, who thinks she's going back to school for a long time feels "a little weird."
"We have had times of difficult times when we did not leave home anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbuts near the Gaza border.
Prior to last week's fire break, thousands of people living in border areas like Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes in safer areas from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of the Gazan border are suspicious of the return of the Palestinian crane after the death of a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, about ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border, which was the target of a heavy Palestinian attack.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised to "care for children's education and safety".
Israel and Hamas agreed on the current ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the fighting, but it did not resolve many key issues, such as Hamas' demand for the removal of Israel and the Egyptian island and the reopening of the air and sea routes in Gaza.
Israel wants to remove Hamas from the weaponry and return the body of the two Israeli soldiers who fell during the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected in Egypt later this month.
Palestinian and UN estimates indicate that over 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of deaths, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has had no solid evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other gassy soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades at Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, for its part, carried out over 5,000 airs and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled the shelter of over 100 United Nations schools that had been transformed into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelter and continued fighting, the school authorities moved to school in the previous week.
"I hope that the school will open soon and we will be back to school, just like other children in the world and like Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old in a sheltered school in the city of Gaza.
According to the commonly used meter, housing prices have risen most to seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index, which measured the housing prices of the capital city of Australia, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, showed RP data on Monday.
The rise in prices during the summer, July and August period was 4.2 per cent, which is higher than in the same months after 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high than in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but it has not risen steadily throughout the country.
According to RP Data's research director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price rise.
The results of RP Data show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and by 11.7 per cent in Melbourne in the previous year.
The housing market in Adelai, Brisbane and Darwin is now the busiest; the average price increase is from five to six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices only increased by 1.4% per year as a result of government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring in Australia is beginning to increase the number of dwellings sold in the coming months, a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the rise in the sales of auctioned dwellings, generally moderate sales rate and continuing low interest rates, it is likely that the increase in house prices will continue to continue over the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences from Mänttä
The new museum and art has attracted record audiences this summer in Mänttä.
By the end of August more than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and features classic works of pop art by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä's visual arts weeks again told us that on Monday he made a visitor's performance, when 14 500 visitors had been to the Waiting Event this summer.
These figures are not used to.
People have been picked up from doors and windows," says director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Civonen estimates that the total number of visitors this year will come to the Serlachius Museums this year to bring about 100 thousand.
In previous years, there have been some 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen recalls that the new museums are always when they open up phenomena.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the art period will continue well beyond the summer.
In autumn, the art museum will open new exhibitions.
The police are investigating theft in Kajaan in the last four days.
On Sunday night, the commercial property was broken by breaking a window.
The author had received a small amount of money from the cashier.
Between Thursday and Monday, the Deep Sea Street had stolen fuel from the truck.
Between Sunday and Monday the boat had been taken from the port of Bettacinniska to the rear engine.
The rowing boat was a sign of Kalapata in light and yellow inside.
On the inside read the text "OIVA".
A couple of suspects of stealing a cop had a chance to catch up.
On Sunday night, Tikkapurontie broke into a commercial property.
The police dog got a copy and a two-footed palemoon man was found in the woods under a tree.
On Monday, the police picked up another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected to have committed the same break.
Missing amphetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaan
The disappearance of just under ten grams of amphetamines brought the murder charge to the Kajanian man who was born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his common-law partner and another man and shot at the shotgun as an exporter of drugs by the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old Kajaani woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed another man was a shooter.
The case became known to the police when the police patrol stopped a passenger car with a partner burning clothes used in the blood.
In addition to burnt coats, a broken shotgun was found in the car.
Kainuu's district court will issue a judgment on the matter later.
August was very rare in many places.
According to the information service, August is a warm one, on average, repeated once in ten years.
According to the statistics of the Institute, the average temperature was higher than in the whole country.
In most of the country the deviation was from one to two degrees.
Due to the whole of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest summer temperature was measured in the first week of August in Por, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says my father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in a seven - child family from Jamaica, Dudley, in the British Midlands region, in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on his father's imaginary conversation and is developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel series.
The sound track is a mix of reggae and rap on upbeat.
Henry's had to go through some painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times after his mother's death, and he thinks a lot about his relationship with his father.
It was very hard to read about my father.
His face was never visible, only the voice said, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at Cricket now.
My parents, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of a beer court or the beauty of a cricket night.
I never talked to him about such things.
Most of my life he was to me that smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal insulator in Dudley and thus gained an idea of how his father’s life must have been, even though working conditions today are better than at the time.
Sulatistas are a little lighter today, but they are practically dark, smokey, labyrinthic depths, with flames, smoke, and nodules that bring to mind the tutelage.
Father used to go to a bath and only in the bathtub, and slowly he began to sing to himself as he washed away the dirt from the melting plant.
As I walked around, I realized that he had been working on it for years to get us food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the proximity of the parents.
My father never hugged me, never said he loved me.
Only when my mother started sick a little before she died did we begin to repeat to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child, she has been able to share the love that was missing from her as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you"?
Stop the hugging already!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why would Dawn and I not be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to mother's death.
When I started suffering from excessive obesity and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I began to exercise a lot, and I also had to start with a hard diet to reduce the symptoms.
It is very difficult —
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known short beard may describe his change during career development.
After getting a lot of good feedback from the critics on his role as Othello, he is immersed in making a theater.
The next step was the Commedia of Misery and August Wilson's Fences ("Aidat").
Making a theatre offers a different experience than the Sitcoms and comedians Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started a factory worker when he was only 16 years old.
One dishman noticed him on stage making imitations and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-70s. "For a long time I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned how to work.
I had to grow up in the spotlight, I had to learn to produce jokes from a slide band between 1975 and 1985, while life was a star and I was on television.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared in black makeup, so Henry ended up in a comedian program for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated, but I do not regret it.
Even though my position was strange and disgusting, I was able to work on huge events and learned how to deal with the audience.
Yet "brit-tv's rewarded, multi-year favourite and light entertainment program" was at the same time "irritable parody of black people".
Henry worked in the '80s in the second series of comedy, where both the jokes were made and the black British culture admired.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and in the 90's Henry was known for his character chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
For the next decade Henry spent advertising, documentaries, TV series and movie parts, but after his series of LennyHenry.tv in the BBC in 2008 he said to himself: "What are you going to do next, Len – now it seems that you're just walking on the side track or on the side track."
Next up was Radio 4's documentary series "What's So Great About...".
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really properly taught at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class that wears socks and has money.
That's why Shakespeare raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: "Try.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Meet the words and you understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry pronounced 20 verses of Othello's last speech for the document and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It felt almost like some of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your bag, do a small background study.
So the training process was hard, and I read the play for months before it was done.
The play was eventually a success.
It was apparently expected to fail, but that was not exactly the case.
Soon after that, Henry played the main part in the Commedia of Misery.
Suddenly, I exhibited at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it was true.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
Once upon a time there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"My little voice in my mind said to me, "You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again."
Instead, the director’s assistant announced that the performance will be continued as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the stage, and some of me felt relieved.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to the others.
"You are part of the play, stay in your role
Henry's "Fences" play at the Duchess Theatre
It was challenging to learn about the "Fences" show.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
Even this play was well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you have to do."
This, of course, is what Henry says by the voice of KUMEALL.
I mean, I decided to stick here.
I sincerely love this job.
I love practice rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comedian: little humorous boys keep interrupting our discussions when he changes from imitation to imitation.
Stand-up abstention is a question of will, as immediate thanks from the unknown public seems dangerous.
If you yearn for it all the time, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo theatre when it feels like it, but in general it no longer inspires me the way it used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's going to take another stand-up tour.
Give me real joy to sit with the director who will help to shape the entire journey at the beginning, the middle and the end, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.

Kenya is drawing up a register of officials to remove "hazards"
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric record of officials in its attempt to remove "hazard cost factors" from the government's pay lists.
Workers who did not register during the next two weeks would no longer be entitled to a salary, the government bulletin announced.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to receive remuneration after leaving their post.
President Uhuru Kenyat promised to fight public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
According to the audit carried out earlier this year, at least one million dollars were spent on 'wrapped workers' salaries and other economic abuses.
The government suspects that salaries will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left his official's office, the BBC Wanyama Chebusiri reports about the capital of Nairobi.
In order to ensure that their data are recorded in biometric form, all officials must report to themselves in identification centres during the following weeks, as reported in the Government Bulletin.
According to the press, anyone who fails to do so without due cause will be removed from the pay lists.
"This measure significantly rationalizes the public sector by defining how many people actually work, and also cleans up the pay lists at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of 'dangerous workers'," says Anne Waiguru, official of the Cabinet of the Ministry responsible for decentralisation and planning.
The financial result of the Wall River 2015 may remain EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure in a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current budgetary preparation, the annual deficit will remain at around 9.4 million.
Possible ways of improving the efficiency of the system were to increase the scope and level of services, to increase the purchase of services, to sell and grant assets, and to increase tax and payment revenues.
The investment cut-off target of EUR 10 million is EUR 8.5 million.
There is no relief for the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, increased unemployment and a reduction of 5% in government contributions further undermine the outlook.
The aim of the seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The City Government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into a strategic objective, says Kimmo Heinonen, President of the City Government.
The City Government returned the proposals made to the Executive Board for further preparation.
The proposals made by the City Government form the basis for the preparation of the budget at the delegation's economic seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
The draft budget will be forwarded to the municipal government and the city council through the committee procedure after the delegation seminar.
Ten Turkish police officers arrested on suspicion of "running" against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "the anti-government plot", reports local media sources.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 high-ranking police officers among the arrested.
Some of the police were involved in the corruption investigations carried out last December involving government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, a number of police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing a large criminal gang and monitoring telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who acted as Prime Minister during that period) said that police action was part of the planned action against Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of Ukraine’s schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told waiting journalists that not all schools have opened again, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September was not held at every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian breast, must fight for peace.
Aleksanda Pastukhov, who is the head teacher at Slaviansk School, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter goes, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to gain a lesson that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school traditionally include children’s written shirts, balloons and the giving of flowers to teachers.
Texas Perry's argument was unprobable.
On Sunday evening, the confirmed Twitter account of the Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, sent a blasphemous picture of the democratic district attorney when he heard the accusations about the abuse of power.
The Tweet was later removed and followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the picture.
The Tweet was sent from my account without permission.
"I do not accept tweets and I have removed them," the later publication said.
Perry's background forces immediately failed to respond to clarification requests.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the picture.
The first dispute included a mockery of Travis's district lawyer, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of a motor drink in April 2013.
Perry prevented Lehmberg’s office from funding when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential elections.
The title of the Tweet was: "I don't always drive drunk, three times with larger proms... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing a finger."
I'm Texas's most humble democracy.
Lehmberg's agency did not conduct a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was carried out by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio, who was assigned by the Republican judge.
Perry has said he's innocent and called accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge to reject the accusations and said that the law on which the governor of Texas's longest office is charged is unclear against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million of State aid to a government insurrection unit operating in the County of Travis and handling public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision led the left-wing monitoring group to make an official complaint.
Perry’s established Twitter account is updated regularly – and sometimes famously.
After reaching fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the match by publishing on Twitter a picture of himself flying a lake with the text "Here we come, South Carolina!" with.
Berkeley says the housing market is again "normal"
One of London’s most important builders has warned that the South East England housing market has “returned” to the normal level of activity.
The capital of London’s homes have been experiencing enormous demand and sharp price increases while fearing a widespread credit bubble, which led the British bank to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
The founder of a high-level builder, Berkeley, and Tony Pidgley, President, said on Monday that "from the beginning of the current financial year the markets and the volume of trade have returned to normal after the 2013 peak" and added that this has allowed a "stable operating environment".
During the recession in London, the housing market went well as foreign investors sought out by flocks to the capital.
According to the country register, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average selling prices of private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose in the fifth year before, reaching a price increase of GBP 423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London's real estate site less attractive in recent months - some of the interest has also affected new property taxes and political rhetoric about potential "map tax" before the May general elections.
Last week, London’s real estate broker Foxtons warned that the April mortgage report, which reported stricter lending terms, would lead to low market growth, both in terms of sales volumes of real estate and in terms of prices in the second half of the year.
The Bank of England’s recent data on Monday showed that the number of approved loans fell in July, which indicates a cooling housing market.
The real estate agent Hamptons International has reduced its 2015 forecast of London real estate prices by 3%, as the index of homeowners' opinion about prices has already started to decline.
The number of transactions made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped in a quarter to one year ago, says real estate agent WA Ellis.
The demand for homes in the capital, however, is a blessing for Berkeley, which raised revenue from the properties sold to over GBP 2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for the right type of product, well-designed, has remained stable in the best locations and has therefore remained strong in sales".
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year preceding April, which is almost a third more than at the time of the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits thus increased by 40 per cent year-on-year, to GBP 380 million and net sales increased by 18 per cent to GBP 1.6 billion.
Pidgley told us on Monday before the company's Annual Meeting that Berkeley's earnings are in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the pre-tax profit of the year is GBP 450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold evenly at a price of GBP 23,96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked photos into the web
Jennifer Lawrence will be attending the 85th Annual Academy Awards Award Awards ceremony.
The hacker who claims to hold a hundred other star photos leaked Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence's naked photos on the web.
The Star of Hunger confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned the hacker for "destructive violation of privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will have the accusations.
The photos that were originally published on the 4chan image page had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of the Apple iCloud storage system. Due to the 100 other hacking targets, it is claimed that there are ten other women, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not known how much of the pictures are authentic, although Scott Pilgrim versus World Star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at my and my husband's privacy years ago to take pictures: hopefully you have a good mind," Winstead tweeted.
However, Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series Victoria Justice denied the authenticity of the pictures and tweeted that "the so-called naked pictures of me are WORRY, don't you understand."
Let me finish this right from the start.
On Sunday late, BuzzFeed announced that the pop star Ariana Grande's representative denied the authenticity of the star's images.
We're the only ones to show up for the new novel that Howard Jacobson has been thanked for, which tells us about love and the j-letter.
They dissipated, it best described what happened, gradually dissipating each other like a box of cardboard left in the rain.
Only then did he hear from a woman that she was too serious, bothering, intense, disconnected, and perhaps even a little sloppy.
That's when he swinged his hand.
He identified the thorn.
Yeah, he was a long shot, like a wire.
His last victim had a relationship at the beginning, but it had been promising; it seemed that this relationship could have facilitated his lonely boredom, and it might have brought his life even some content.
Ailin's Solomons had unbearable hair and she was delicately beautiful with a joyous heart, a northern village that was even more barren and far away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come to the south with a parent travel partner, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt. He had inherited a house that was located in a wet but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was appropriate for the Paradise valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The tubes leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, the ethanes had left behind in the windows keeping the whole place of their own, the garden was full of weeds that resembled giant bald heads.
The cottage was like children's rain, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Author told: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated as the winner of the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
The conditions will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailnin in a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying the surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening to a scattered receptioner, through which the whole country heard the gratifying music and calming news, while Ailnin's cross-breeded feet brought to Kevern's mind a song that had long since been sung by forgotten black performers and which his father had often listened to in the cabin's sprinklers downstairs.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not banned — nothing was actually prohibited — but they were no longer just playing.
They wanted to be forgotten, just like the word "forgotten."
Public opinion brought about what the laws and the proclamation had not achieved: just as in the literature, people chose to read memories of heroes, cookbooks and romances, they favor ballads in terms of music.
On the wild day Kevern started with the catchy piano and sings the serenad on the big legs with a loudly coveted voice.
Ailin didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and at the same time raised two fingers naturally in front of his mouth.
This is what his father had always done before the letter "j" got away from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was a kid.
His father told me he played the same game with his father.
If you let go of the word "J" in your mouth, and you didn't remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you'd have to pay a pen.
It wasn't very fun to play at the time, and it wasn't even that now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what jazz is.
Ailin had never heard of such a thing.
Even jazz was not actually declared prohibited, it was not just played.
Improvising was no longer in fashion.
There was room in life for only one if-word.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It had been the same way to nocturnalness.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was nocturnal through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become known to him through his father's half-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given the age of Alining, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
Neither was there any need for legislation nor for enforcement.
Hearing society meant that each part of it was accepted as grateful — grateful, as if they had been saved as happiness in the trade — the principle that each group did natural things to it.
Based on their temperament and physical properties, people with African-Caribbean roots are best suited to entertain and sport, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian continent, they were as natural as gifted with electrical equipment, so their task was to ensure that every family had a working telephone that was used to handle matters.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the rafts.
When WE, which TAPAHTU, were found, they were from the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled rapidly in fear of being charged with scorching flames and fearing that the flames would reach them later, opened restaurants serving the labneh yoghurt and burned the water pipe, and continued their lives looking down upon the earth and in boredom.
Let everyone work according to their gifts.
Ailin had only heard ballads, and he was hard to understand how Kevern’s insulting words had never been put on music.
There was love through music.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except for the big-footed, maybe.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound isolation of giant bald leaves.
But Ailin didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers on his lips with Alining.
I thought she was strange already.
"He thought it was funny," he said instead.
Ailin dropped his head unbelieving, and his hair covered Kevern’s sight.
Nothing else can be seen in the whole world than the huge, varicose veins of AILINNI.
Nothing else she wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
Ailin seemed to be genuinely confused.
Are my legs so big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was still too early for it.
"I think you're attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This wasn't helpful.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the persuasive charm that could control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
No matter how gentle your eyes are.
Ailin Solomons blushed and got up from his terrace chair and at the same time knocked down the receiver and spilled the wine they had just been drinking.
The wine was made only out of crayfish, so he could not use it as a reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to be shaking like palm leaves in the storm.
"And your fat head is what I'm all about to attract in you," he said.
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Alinni, both for his own, unnecessary cruel words, and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the time Ailin decided to stand against him.
Did Ailin think he was gonna hit?
He had never told Kevern about life in the hysterical northern archipelago where he had grown, but Kevern was sure that basically it had been the same as life here.
The same huge, hysterical sea that waved against them.
The same messy men, although even more pale and gloomy than their smugglers and disperse parents, walked from pub to pub, ready to beat every woman who dares to resist or tease them.
Big head?
He'd still see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
Sucking first — kissing had become the most common word for erotic encounters between men and women; receiving the anti-medic of the meaningless love balloons that pump out — suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought it was too much, for already sucking itself was hostile.
The body language of Ailin Solomons told him to leave.
He pulled himself up in the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailin also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern’s grief surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailin followed his journey — just as his travel partner watched Kevern’s journey out of the upper window — a man who was the cause of his own heavy life.
The morning leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Kevern and men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him.
A man who had turned his back, bowed, ashamed, beaten, lost in battle — why did he feel that vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that once before this moment had seen it?
When Ailin's Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the recent event, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution measuring general mood at Ofnow, conducted a short research into the continuation of minor and moderate violence in the areas of the country in which the reduction of violence, or the total elimination of violence, was most likely to take into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"The battle has already been accomplished, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "that it is possible to balance the natural aggression of the people who have fought and most often won, especially in the abandoned and remote quarters, where, despite the cross-sectional ecclesial branches, human limbs are rarely known in the past.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the moods it gives rise to.
The people weep with sentimental ballads, weeping with stories of winning opposition, swearing in the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty keeps incessant grip on both rural communities and urban communal areas, and there is also evidence of a new, more vicious contention in homes, workplaces, streets and even playgrounds.
"You have a sad tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum was looking down on the ground.
And I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to her right not to answer any personal questions.
Feminist?
Again silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I oppose atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
No prejudices are maintained at this workplace.
We are servants of an unpretentious society.
While some kind of hypersensitivity is completely acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted results, as you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelty or malice, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
As if it had happened yesterday, if it had happened at all, it would destroy the fundamental vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around when Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz’s head, the flameless red LED light declared the instructions that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for a quarter or longer of the previous century.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, discuss, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, and singing is better than written, but nothing overcomes love.
"I understand very well what you want to say", Esme Nussbaum replied with a quiet voice when it was certain that his director had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as well healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I'm worried that if we're not warned, we'll see that we're repeating the same mistakes that originally led to what we're gonna do if we're gonna do it.
This time, though, we will not shed our hatred and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid on his finger.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "in describing as 'mistakes' the actions that our grandparents may have done or may not have done.
You also go too far in saying that they spilled 'their anger and distrust of others'.
The person in your position should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we do not talk about 'we' or 'they'.
There was nothing 'us' or 'others'.
It was chaos time, that's all we know.
"If we are completely honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "no group of society can say that they have behaved well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
What was done was done either good or bad.
That's when it was.
There is no need to talk about it more – we agree on this.
And just as there is no need to share accusations, so there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But for what is the past then, if it is not taught --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramids.
"I'm going through your report," he said and said, "Esmen was time to go.
The next day, as he was working normally, he was hit by a motorcyclist on the footwalk, whose driving by-passes were described as "bad and angry".
There's a lot of coincidences happening.
Lesotho's army forbids the attack planned; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
The army officials in Lesotho have denied the launch of a government strike and said they were acting against the police, who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and conquered government buildings in the capital Maserus.
The head of state travelled with his family to South Africa after telling them that he had a death threat.
Major Ntle Ntoi, a representative of the army, denied the strike and said that the army was responding to this threat from "political fanatics."
"Lesotho's defence forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America News Office.
According to Clayson Monyela, President of the South African Government, the military's actions looked like a revolution.
"Although no one has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the actions of Lesotho's defence forces appear to have all the signs of a corresponding revolutionary undertaking," he says.
The army officials of Lesotho said that the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday, and there was a peaceful atmosphere in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes that action is being taken because he has tried to fight corruption.
In Lesotho, tensions have arisen since June when Thabane interrupted parliamentary sessions due to the disagreements of the government of the great coalition.
He thus forbids that he has declined the power of the government, although it is claimed otherwise.
Trade Fair: Microsoft Sets up a Data Center for the New Zealand
The information technology company Microsoft has set up a large data centre in New Zealand where the location of the company will not be specified.
In a press release sent by Microsoft to the media, the company notes that it does not report on the location of all its data centres for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's a million-dollar investment for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaan had previously been bequeathed to the centre.
Microsoft completely quits its Oulu office, which takes the job out of about 500 people.
All in all, Microsoft has announced that it will terminate up to 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft’s communications manager Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company does not comment on how much staff a new data center employs.
The establishment of a data centre for the new country was announced on Monday in Kauppalehti.
People are accused of assaulting a girl in traffic lighting
78-year-old man is charged with driving a three-year-old girl in traffic lighting in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of driving on a girl at a cruise in Pittenween in Eastern Neuk.
According to the prosecutors, Stewart ran his Audi Q3 car carelessly and caused injuries to her.
Stewart, 78 from Anstruther, denied charges at the Dundee Sheriff's Session.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater pictures and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos under the water, you will have several different device options to choose from.
The best option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both paying about $300.
I took these photos myself at the family party using several different cameras, each of which paid less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, still make sure that the camera battery and other parts are closed waterproof.
In addition, set the camera description settings to match the images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and video camera have a configuration that optimizes the conditions of description under water.
Furthermore – before you jump into the water, make sure that you can take your device deep.
Some cameras last only 5 feet deep, others up to 50-60 feet deep.
Check out our standard and water-resistant models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to summize the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it's hard to see under the water, and the image can either succeed or fail.
So take a few pictures.
If your camera also allows for forklifts, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will fall significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when photographing in the swimming pool, lake or sea.
This way you can also picture more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the object to be photographed.
This is important advice when describing the land, but even more important under water, because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the viewer has to be close to the object in order to fill the entire frame of the image.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – demonstrators swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not choose candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing unease of democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark at the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong’s business district after the activists have started planning and implementing their statements only hours after the decision has been published.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress gives virtually Communists the power to take away all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still raging," says the president of the democratic party, legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are working with a self-governing government.
Li Fei, Vice-Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the administration of China, saying that the general nomination of the Hong Kong leader would be too 'caotic'.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom handed over Hong Kong to China Beijing, it promised the inhabitants of the region that it would be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to China’s leaders, the decision on Sunday was a democratic breakthrough, as it would enable Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the nomination committee, which is managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
In the summer before the decision, Hong Kong organised a number of the biggest and most noteworthy protests in the region.
A major part of the campaign to defend democracy was the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which organizers have threatened to prevent business block operations if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine public voting rights.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central’s supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong’s main administrative buildings.
In the demonstration, the movement’s organisers announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and would bring about protests in the coming weeks.
However, they apparently did not give details, fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their online press release, the organizers said that the movement " views Occupy Central as the last means to be put in place only if there is no hope of dialogue and no other way".
We are very sorry to announce that today's last opportunity for dialogue has failed and that the conquest of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing Declaration for days already, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the government’s main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest feeds many people’s feelings that people are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave from the mainland has caused competition for products and services.
Furthermore, there is fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement for threatening Hong Kong’s living conditions — the business world.
"The process they are talking about can lead to great economic losses, depending on how many people take part and how long it lasts," says legislator Regina Ip, who has long appreciated the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is going to skate away from our pick.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
The Chinese state media has also presented stories that Hong Kong's democracy activists are the cornerstones of the revolution of the Lithuanian Western powers."
This summer, activists held a referendum on non-official voting rights, involving 780 000 people — more than a fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the region's largest democracy demonstrations.
Your U.S. prom tradition is hitting Britain's universities: new students' private projects
We are eager to respond to the demand by establishing the first class of travel in Britain for today's students.
In addition to a private plane, the company also offers other vehicles such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can make sure that they arrive at the university as forever as possible.
According to Stewart, there is also a safety aspect in the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer students today as easy and high-quality transportation to the university as possible.
According to the company representative, reservations have not yet been made because the service has just been set up, but added that "students will start making orders over the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is demand for the service, although most students pay 9,000 tuition fees.
Today’s students are very different from their expectations and hopes from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. It is now more important than ever to create an unforgettable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Organisation criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to the Vice President of the Higher Education Section of the organisation Megan Dunn, "this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the student majority".
Many of the students who start their studies this month are shocked by the level of living costs, as the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has been left behind by the dramatic increase in basic costs.

In the announcement Connells describes the former meeting room as "a unique one-bedroom house".
Although the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it still appears in advertisements.
The sale of the house has aroused interest in social media, where the question is whether the pig belongs to the price of the house.

Bulgarian prison staff is holding a national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria expressed their opinion in front of Sofia's Ministry of Justice.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted back old working provisions that were recently changed.
Salary increases are also to be discussed with Mr Hristo Ivanov, interim minister of justice.
For a month, prison officials have symbolically protested against new working hours, saying that they want to return to an old 24 hour work schedule.
Despite the meeting of the prison workers’ organisation and the representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, says Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are currently under way, Mr Rosen Zhelyazkov, Director-General for the Enforcement of Judgments, told BNR.
The protest of the prison workers’ association is also expected to be linked to members of the Trade Union of Internal Ministry workers.
Basketball: Fans’ incentive almost too much: Sasu Salin was fainting in the field
The basketball Sasu Salin today was the physique of Finland's victory.
He was able to forget his heart rate in his U.S. match and left the blood of the second half of Ukraine with his standing solutions.
But Salin transferred all his honor to the wolves, and he did it in the style of:
I was going to go to the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In the eyes, it was dark, nothing.
That noise and the white sea of the public were almost too much for me.
The power times of Salin were held in nine surfaces at a fast rate, incandescents, discs, and teddy in every place where the event took place.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into such a flow mode that everything worked out.
They come from a place that's sometimes, and now it's a crazy place to be, Sasu glowed.
It's my role.
To do all that.
Now it was great to see the others caught up with the plot.
It caught the whole gang.
Salin is a team jockey and spirit, so it’s no wonder that his example raised the whole team’s flight, which was too much for the big and tough Ukraine’s five.
Finland at the MM-games after 32 years' break: The previous game was remembered as a gross judge's game
Heikki Montonen (oik.) was the head coach of Finland in the 1982 Argentina MM tournament.
It's been 32 years since the Finnish men's balloon team last played in the MM finals.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where legendary Reino Kosonen was a Finnish second coach and current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as they did yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the early part of the game.
"The court game in the match balls was pretty rough," said Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the backline.
All of a sudden, the game was continued.
We lost it 2-3, and after that the shits went crazy more than that," said Parkkali.
Finland played Chief Coach Heikki Montosen in command and eventually ranked 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world's choices when Poland's MM tournament comes at a speed this Saturday.
Many things have changed in an international balloon over the past 32 years.
Players' power values are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
Players' averages have also increased.
The game is faster than ever," thought Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to be able to move on from the initial block.
Then you can become tight already," said Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a winning match against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the MM tournament.
Let's hope we're going to betray 17th place now.
South Korea and Tunisia should go crazy," said Parkkali.
==History==Reino Kosonen was born in Argentina, Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö winded up in the Tunisian match.
Sauna and evening break at the Marine Church in Buenos Aires were part of the national team program at the 1982 MM tournament.
Kari Kali (o.k.) and his teammates stretched out.

Finnish tourists saved a dog from the Cita mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs got in trouble on Thursday in the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini were bravely offered to help.
At the end of the week Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once more.
In a public Facebook update, Mikkelsen told us that the Cita dog with him on Thursday in the mountains hurt his tass.
The injured dog could no longer walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried to attract it many times and pull it a little further, but its legs did not just carry, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, no help came from the police, from a nearby hotel, or from passersby.
In the dark of the evening, the situation began to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini, a Tamperian, and Thomas, his father.
Men had visited the highest mountain in Norway at Galdhøpiggen and headed for their campground when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help her with a dog, Antti Soini tells her in a message sent to Overnight Sanom.
Soon a German man who had a hiking guide came with him.
Patja Cita had a pair of hands attached to the injured dog.
The German man came here a moment after us, after we had wondered what to do with the dog and carried the dog in the lap for a while down the hill, Soini tells us.
KUVA: Judge Soini
The dog could have been carried down with the help of a trip path.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but it was slow to carry on in difficult terrain.
However, in about an hour and a half Cita was fortunately brought down.
After the event Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook so that he could thank them once again.
Soins answered him on Sunday, but apparently the German man is still unattainable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen's happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have necessarily returned.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I am eternally grateful to them.
On Monday night, the Soins were already on their way home.
They had a lot of good things about Mikkelsen, and they said Cita's feeling better already!

Genetic abnormality is often misdiagnosed
A British woman was afraid of dying for years because of the wrong diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years of life left because he had been diagnosed with another disease.
He really suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth’s disease (CMT). It means a bunch of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, the wrong diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, because there is so little knowledge of it.
It is estimated that some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are suffering from CMT disease, which causes symptoms of motor medicine, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking, and toe sphincter.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in the wheelchair before he was 18 and died before he reached the age of 30.
Today, 51-year-old mother of two says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things I could do as others did.
I fell every day, and I took more time than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran in a different way than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was subjected to several akills voltage surgery to direct his feet. When he left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers, which said he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I had to get back to the library with the information about the illness and I wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair by the age of 18, and I'd die before I turned 25, and I'd lose my whole function in between.
I went through this for myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers tells us that by the age of 17 he found that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "A girl in gold, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you'd be already in the wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something much less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT disease.
"When I was told what CMT is, I thought I had been postponed," she says.
Charity CMT UK organises the CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
A hundred migrants were found in a truck in Macedonia.
The Macedonian authorities have found over a hundred illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, the country’s Ministry of the Interior reported on Monday.
Most of them were Syrians and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
They were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they were coming from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, a publicist at the Ministry of the Interior.
According to the police, the migrants had paid about EUR 3 000 each to get to Greece, and an additional EUR 800-900 to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants go through Macedonia with a large number of millions of people on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the civil war in Syria.
Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence
Pop groups Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined Scottish independence supporters.
According to Guardian, in a few weeks’ time, the bands will be aiming for a concert in Edinburgh to support the independence project.
A referendum on Scottish independence will be held on 18 September.
In his press release Mogwai said that voting is an opportunity for Scots who only happen once in their lives.
Previously, the actor Sean Connery has given his support to independence.
Instead, for example, the British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie have appealed to the Scottishs to remain as part of Britain.
In Gallupia, the supporters of independence have been lost.
Difficulties in the goods industries continued in mid-summer - Homeland news - Night-Sanomat
The lower hill of the department store also continued in July, says the Päivittaistavarkauppa ry.

Sales grew most in small stores and large supermarkets.
During the first year, i.e. January-July, turnover in goods industries and hypermarkets has fallen by more than two per cent.
On the other hand, sales of daily items have increased by almost one per cent.

Areva-Siemens: The sub-reactor reactor of Olkiluodo will be completed in mid-2016
Areva has provided Industry with an updated schedule for Industry's Power TVO.
According to Areva, the latest delays in the project have been mainly due to the fact that approval of the reactor automation systems has been sought.
The project is already years late.
In May, the TVO gave no estimate of the time of manufacture of the three reactors.
Nastola donated a 1.4 - hectare beach plot to Bottaks about EUR 60000
The municipal government of Nastola donated a form driver to Valtteri Bottakse 1.4 hectares from the shore of Kärkjärvi.
The municipal government showed a fair sports spirit and was unanimous in its decision.
Soran was not part of the meeting when the land was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syrrak.
Bottas' gift house has a total of seven farm buildings.
The town will unload them again this year except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a leisure apartment on the property within two years.
We are pleased that he has enjoyed his birth control and wants to be here in the future too.
The Lord has visited undergraduates every year to tell them about his sports career and his life.
And hopefully it will continue, the head of the municipality says.
The municipality's manager estimates the value of the beach plot to be EUR 40000-60000.
The beach is low and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Nastola has been successful over the decades in sports with the help of talent fields in the municipality.
The world champion Aki Parviainen and the world champion of aerobics, Tuuli Matinsalo, received their homes from the municipality and built their own shelters.
However, they did not stay in Nastola, but sold their properties and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsaloin came to Nastola after work and then changed the situation of life elsewhere.
Bottas is a native Nastola, and his situation is different, in the heart of Syria and believes in the permanent home of Bottas.
A fool of yours with the record number of the Hernandez Society
Hull, a member of the team, invested a record in the acquisition of Abel Hernandez, a Uruguayan country team member.
Hernandez will exchange Hulli's Italian laisseura from Palermo with GBP 9.5 million, or around EUR 12 million.
The contract is three years old.
Hernandez scored 14 goals in the last season when Palermo won Series B and rose to the Italian main series.
In the Uruguay Country Team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
In last summer's MM final, Hernandez came from two matches from exchange to the field.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we've reached in a short time," said Hull's Chief Coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull told us that he also acquired Senegal's country team captain Mohamed Diamen West Ham.
The Russian space test failed. The geeks sent on a sex trip died.
The five little bells sent to Russia’s outer space have died, says Roscosmos, the Russian Federation’s space agency.
Gekot travelled on the Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Finland on Monday morning.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geeks in a non-compressive state.
One male gekko and four females participated in the experiment.
Even if the test sounds more distinctive, it was meant to be serious.
For example, little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of giant eggs.
It is possible to anticipate the effects of weightlessness on humans in a state corresponding to longer periods of time, as observed in New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and cause of death or cause of death are investigated.
According to Interfax's news agency, passengers crossed into "sexuals" were frozen.
It is also surprising to note that the fruit flies carried by the same Foton-M4 survived the difficulty of travelling and also experienced post-growth.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
22-year-old man is suspected to have been the recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed us on Sunday.
The authorities found a man after he had attracted a 16-year-old girl to Syria with money.
She was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alarmed the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of the daughter's intention and told the authorities that the family was not related in Turkey.
According to the authorities, he is from Chechnya, but he is now living in France.
The French intelligence authorities had followed the man’s actions before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that the radicalised young people who were attracted to the wars in Iraq or Syria also represent a security risk for France.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or books in France have travelled to Syria during the last conflict, returned there or are currently planning to leave Syria.
Composition: We have a good chance of winning
The hopes of the basketball team for the next place are at stake when Finland will face the second round of the World Cup in Ukraine today.
If the opening house had been expected for the United States, Ukraine would again be among the countries from which Finland would have to take the necessary profits in the future.
Ukraine has a good gang, but I believe we have a good chance of winning, Petri Kopone's advance.
On Saturday, Ukraine hit the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match of races.
The team is training an NBA veteran Mike Fratello, who is commanding Ukraine to play aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is the game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the 100-metre world champion after three years.
The Dominican Republic against Jeter threw 16 points.
Pooh Jeter's fast guy, but we've been played against them before and we have to get our standard defense right, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland will play better than yesterday in its defeat in the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee that we'll see a normal suture in the field, Möttlä said.
The alleged naked images of Hollywood stars are spreading online - part confirmed as genuine
On the Internet, a number of naked images are spread, which are alleged to present famous public figures.
Among other things, the actor Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of the "snake campaign".
TMZ has published an angry comment by Lawrence’s representatives that would appear to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a brutal breach of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, representatives threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that her images are genuine.
He had taken these pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine the creepy pain that was seen for this.
I feel compassion for all those who became victims of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, the actor Victoria Justice calls images of his own name falsified.
At least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer are also on the move.
The Honka painter criticized his own people for not working enough to get out of here.
Football club FC Honka is currently in the final place of the league.
After the VPS match on Sunday, goaltender Walter Viitala’s comments describe a very confusing current situation.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But everything has to adapt," Viitala said after the battle ended on the second death.
Honka made a lot of defense head mistakes in the first half of the game, especially in the first half.
The goalkeeper Viitala wasn't a bad defense-playing guy.
In Hong Kong, player traffic has been busy this summer, and that is why the defenders in front of Viitala have changed rapidly.
As a result, many young players have also been given opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"The part doesn't work enough for it to get out of here sometimes," Viitala defied to name no single player.
Hong Kong head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitala.
"After the game, I told certain players that if you come to practice and play to have fun and you think you're a poker player and you don't have to work, you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
Kuqi also pointed out, however, that players cannot expect immediate success when teammates are constantly changing.
This period has not had twice the same composition successively.
In particular, there have been changes in the defense team.
That's the biggest reason why we're in this place," Kuqi said.
After the VPS kill, Honka is a serial jumbo, at the same time as the last TPS.
There are still seven rounds of the winning league, so there is still time to avoid a fall to the One.
I've never dropped the team, and I'm not gonna drop it now.
We will certainly not fall out of this series," the goaltender Viitala said.
Lars von Trier on the TV series after decades of break
The film director Lars von Trier intends to return to work as the author of the TV series.
The Danish director is preparing a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
The series project was attended by Louise Vesth, producer of Trier's films, at the Venice Film Festival on Monday.
According to the production company Zentrope’s newsletter, the series descriptions should start in 2016.
Trier is reported to have been working on a series of manuscripts since this autumn.
The series is in English.
The newsletter also reports on Trier's long-term partner, Peter Aalbæk Jensen, a well-known producer of his sales speeches.
According to him, a similar series "has never been seen and will never be seen".
"Keep your breath," says Aalbæk Jensen in the press.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his high-profile media performances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the Kingdom series for television.

From the participant to the Ice Bucket challenge
Britti Isabelle Roberts raged so hard, when cold water was poured on him, that he hurt his face ass.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
A woman has been taken to the treatment after she had run the Ice Bucket challenge while doing so hard that her china went off.
Isabelle Roberts raged so hard, when cold water was poured on top of him, that he damaged the structure of his face.
"The water was so cold that I just rang, but when I rang, I felt that the china started to become stiffer," he tells The Mirror.
The ice water is dumped on 20 years old.
Isabelle Roberts a moment before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my chin was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and my sister noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to thank first aid.
The 20-year-old British who participated in the super-populated challenge on Tuesday were taken to the hospital where the jaw was put back.
The video has become an Internet sensation and has been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The angle of the wolves' mouth (also): How can the growth of the number of fans be explained?
Today was a great time.
Thus said basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995 when Finland had played against France in the end of the European Championship in Athens’s Marouss Ballroom.
It wasn't too much of a handkerchief.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were those about a hundred Finns who shouted at 20,000 viewers, otherwise they were in empty control of noise.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the Finnish-Ukrainian match of the World Cup?
In Bilbao, a hundred Finnish fans are eighty-fold.
The 1995 European Championship was a time to search for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian short-running match in the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory opened the doors to Europe's cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttlä.
Chief coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttöllä's limestone lines to the final tournament team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was a very wise man, even though not everything went according to the manuscript.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
In Athens, Finns were known to be around a little over 100.
It includes journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball trainers and a few fans.
There are also journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
It has grown into incomprehensible relationships of measurement.
I'm sure no one can say the exact number of Finnish chisaturists.
The estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10 000.
There was any number there between, it's an unimaginable number.
This is an explanation to sports sociologists.
In the global economy, companies are moving across borders.
There is still an opportunity to look at how we go internationally.
As mobility increases, we can look at the success of our girls and boys in the world, says Professor Hannu Itkonen, a professor of sports sociology.
There will certainly be Finns in both Spain and in Poland for the World Cup, who will get to know each other.
It's a shared experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
Sport itself needs to be a force of attraction.
The weeping raises the sport's popular culture in part.
There is a lower threshold for going to sporting competitions than to Berlin to watch art.
Without success, the masses will not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
Then Chief Coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and even players to throw themselves into top-level sports professionally.
Almost ten years passed.
Then the direction changed and the ground team activity was raised.
The balloons did the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Wetkonen says, both species have succeeded in producing their top sports, where the sacred Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
Then the audience will also be interested.
And the media has taught what to support such a carnivalist, Itkonen reminds me.
Can the ballooning species transfer this massive interest to domestic areas as well?
In basketball, they play on average for hundreds or a little over a thousand spectators.
The weeping thinks that the question is good and does not necessarily give an answer that promises very good for the species.
Another school believes that interest should shift.
One is the one who doesn't want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking the domestic series are not twice interesting.
It's a challenge for the followers in the midst of drugs.
Security for the Bottas Land - almost 1.5 hectares off the lake
Nastola will reward the Formula driver with the shoreline of the Valtteri Bottas.
The municipal government unanimously approved the handover of 1.4 hectares of land at its meeting on Monday.
There will be a leisure apartment on the property in the future.
Nastola has been followed by the success of Bottas since this karting season.
He is considered a good ambassador to market Lahte, Lahte region, and Nastola.
The gift farm is located in Koiskala, on the shores of Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has become the property of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate trade.
There are seven demolition buildings in the area, of which the municipality will decompose six by the end of this year.
Bottas won his fourth prize in the Belgian competition this year.
He's at MM points at five.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and has lived with her child in Vil source.
He lives here today in England, but he goes to Nastola every time he has free forms.
Bottas has visited upper secondary schools as well as youth facilities.
Design-intelligents come, but hardly for the poor.
It presents and tests them at the current U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart card testers are ball-persons in the field, but also amateur Marcus Giron, who is one of the top players in the university, likes that.
According to him, the shirt helps him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
The shirts are woven from silver sensors, the information being passed on to the jacket in the shirt and then on to a smartphone or a tablet computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythms, stress and steps.
Before throwing the shirt into the washing machine, the centre-united mosquito is removed.
The fashion house hasn't told us the exact time to start selling the shirt, nor even suggested its price, the Tech Times news.
Ralph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothing.
Californian Athos has brought for sale a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing, and muscle work.
The clothes pay a hundred dollars for a piece and the thumb size central unit they require pays two hundred dollars.

Smart way to save on textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon, starting in the second grade, Matt Schroeder invented a smart way to save costs.
He developed a system in which students of subsequent annual courses borrow their books against nominal compensation instead of selling books straight away.
"My book of mathematics would normally have paid 180 dollars; I paid 10 dollars for it for the entire semester and a bottle of sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his last semester book would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university board, an average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly decide to use online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the course and pay much less for it than students buying the book.
According to Neebo Inc, a company with more than 250 campus book shops, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
The sector statistics show that about a quarter of the books of the universities' bookshops were rented books, says Trevor Meyer, Chairman of the Neebo company.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookshops.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online stores
In online stores, a new book can only be received at a third of the price it would pay for the campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is almost $290, but the Chegg.com book is priced at $239.99.
Buy as Used
The books used are a good alternative if the reader does not interfere with other notes and worn out the appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book can be used from the Chegg.com online store at 93.49 dollars.
Brigham Young University’s last year’s student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, tells us that he has bought a book called “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” from Amazon.com for only $0.42.
The new book would have cost you $48.
The director of the Amherst's College Without Walls School at Massachusetts University, Ingrid Bracey and other academics, recommend that students ask their professors if previous pressures can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new pressure are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old pressure can only be found with a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80 per cent of the price of the new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book throughout the semester costs about $20.
See the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the use of interest and the subsequent expenses.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
E-books instead of ordinary papers may also become a question.
Sometimes these books are rented and paid for the right of use of the eBook to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg dealer will receive an eBook from "Calculus" for six months at about $61.
According to Bracey, many students of literature save the most because many classics can now be downloaded free of charge, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
It is worth comparing different sellers, whatever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start law studies in Pepperdine, recommends that you use the ISBN number to find out the price, as it will help to ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order the web, make sure that the book is definitely in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned through this heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was on ice for four weeks, and eventually he had to purchase the book at the full price of the university bookstore.
The Tampere Legion Theatre celebrates 20 years
The theatre set up in 1994 is opposed to unemployment, exclusion and transit.
The work is welcome for anyone who wants to do the performing arts.
Organizes expression-based activities for long-term unemployed aged 17-35.
The proposals often take a stand on society.
In recent years there has been a presentation of, among other things, depression of Moderata, Meself! - humorous stories of narcissism and classical interpretations.
Believes that every person can change his or her own life.
In the fires almost double the number of people killed last year
This year, almost double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year.
According to the Central Rescue Organisation of Finland (Spek) media monitoring, 55 people have already died in fires in 49 different fires to date.
At the corresponding time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65 years of age.
According to the fire-killing statistics of the organisation, the worst situation was last in 2009, when 64 people died in the fires by the end of August.
The majority of burn deaths occur in apartments.
There were 17 fire-killing houses, 21 homes, and seven row houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of a home fire safety trial.
At least all fire alarms in the home should be maintained according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial ignition devices are readily available.
All premises in the home must also be an accessible exit route.
Children should also be informed of the electrical equipment they may use while on their own at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the city centre of Newport on a march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at the Cardiff City Hall at the so-called Counter-Top Meeting.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events during the weekend and spoke to demonstrators who had even arrived from Belgium.
Young people were rescued by air from the Sinis mountains of Australia
THE 19-year-old Patisher was taken to safety after they were stuck in the New South Wales Mountains of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man left for a walk after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheat.
They were worried about young people who hadn't returned home and called the police at eight o'clock.
A search party composed of local police officers and helpers was sent to search for young people, and the twin was found around 23 o'clock near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had broken her knees, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The patients were taken to the Blue Mountains Hospital by ambulance, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhanski airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were given a withdrawal order.
According to Ukraine, the parachute forces have enthusiastically joined forces with Russian tanks in the field.
According to the army representative, the gun gun on the other side has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
During the last 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Asovan Sea, the Ukrainian patrol ship landed yesterday in front of the gun-off in south-eastern Ukraine, says the Border Guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard had no assurance of where the ship was fired.
The Separatists already told us yesterday that they shot the first time in the social media.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
Lavrov, however, called for Ukraine's troops to immediately withdraw to positions from which they could not fire civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should bring about an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Mr Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions about the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
The coastal waters flooded Malmö and Copenhagen
The streets flooded in Malmo and Copenhagen on Sunday, when the rain rains struck southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floods broke down a number of roads, confused traffic and buried cars alone.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that it may take some time to slow down, even though the rains were predicted to end on Monday.
Hard rains surprised the Swedish authorities and rains were not given early weather warning.
Ari Mustala, a day-to-day meteorologist at the Finnish Air Force Agency, estimated that the area’s sader intake was very local.
It looks narrow and permanent.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "be quiet and help France," says Francois Hollande's main supporter.
Valls called for a deeply divided left to "show its feelings" to the socialist president with difficulties, whose new government did not obtain the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves all due respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our mission is to stay with him," Valls said and deserved the applause.
As a debilitating gesture, the Prime Minister called on the Government to remain at peace, despite the 35-hour working week of the French opposition, on the proposal that the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, earlier this week, should end the rule.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to work together with the government.
However, Christiane Taubira, Minister of Justice, gave rise to disparate differences by appearing at the meeting of the Socialist representatives who have presented various opinions and by criticising the Socialist Party for allowing 'France to give up hope for the future'.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front of the Republic of Austria, mocked the continued division of the socialists and said that he did not believe that the new government of Valls would last for a few months.
Francois Hollande may have left by calling the war, but so has Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous one failed to last even for the summer.
"And the new government won't last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told the journalists.
He reiterated his party's proposal to break up the parliament and believed that his party's election victory in early elections would be assured and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a break-up in the municipal elections in March and the extreme right held its head in the EU elections in May.
According to the opinion poll of the Journal du Sundayche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break up into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch period in 2017.
Political researcher Pascal Perrineau at the Po University warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government did not succeed in improving the economy and record-breaking unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may deteriorate further.
The boy betrayed the morning of Finnish planners Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda the boy failed badly in the recorded part of the program.
Last Thursday, the morning’s Finnish program released a fun video of recordings on the Facebook page on Thursday.
In the video, the drinkers Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record the morning of Finland's advertising show the next day, but the recording is not going all the way to the pipeline.
Alm-Siira is confused in his words when he tries to say a word about the budgetary conflict, and his confusion also causes Poudan and Rahkola to lose their son again and again.
And these heroes should be allowed to pull the live broadcast even tomorrow, the morning of the Finnish Facebook update says.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been distributed on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the photographic office of the magazine, was the third in the series of potretts in 1972.
This is the photograph of Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel.
In Helsinki Fredrikikatu, the House of Building Masters was held at the Sosialistinen International Meeting in May 1971.
There were a lot of Heads of State and security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards joined.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we received more than five minutes to film.
I took this picture in five meters.
The light and the background were right.
Right away, I realized I did it this time.
From Meir's look, you can see that the leaders of the Middle East have had a hard time before.
At that time, the people or the images taken from the events were well known.
It is wonderful that you can also succeed in other images today, as long as you have an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is the Lasse Virén crash of the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Claim: Aarnio has already paid more than EUR 5 million
Investigating the legality of the operations of the Helsinki Police Drugs Unit has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 years of work.
In this way, Jyri Rajamäki assessed Jyväskylä University in her thesis on information technology.
It is proposed that police law enforcement and the fight against crime could be significantly improved by combining investigation and judicial systems.
According to the borderline, current technology enables the use of forensic data.
He noted that it was possible to build a system in which the data collected to investigate the crime was automatically electronic evidence satisfying the chain of evidence and, at the same time, to provide comprehensive legal supervision.
The claim will be checked on Saturday.
Yle: 1999's idea of vegetable food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fishmeals included in the fish and chicken food"
A picture of the special news on the wall of the School of Women’s Trail in Pirkala was provided by the food company in social media, says Yle on his website.
Vegetables!
The fish and chicken dishes included in the school lunch.
Only when there's meat on the list will we make a vegetable alternative!
So it is stated in the 15 - year - old newspaper, which was forgotten in the school wall.
I'll let you see the picture here.
In the social media, the image has led people to send an atrocious feedback to Pirkkala.
Head of Food and Cleaning Service Arja Vaarma states to Yle that the note forgotten on the wall is not true and should have been removed some time ago.
Apparently, before my arrival, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with health care in due course.
Every student gets a meal according to his wishes, he says Yle.
Today, Pirkkala schools offer a vegetable food option only with parents’ permission and a doctor’s or nurse’s certificate of the vegetable diet.
The danger justifies the solution to Ylle by the fact that young people’s herbal tests may leave food in short, and the absence of meat or chicken may cause wonder to the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise close to $3 billion Prestige Cruise agreement
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third largest cruise company, is negotiating to buy its competitor for $3 billion from the Prestige Cruises International Inc. The information originates from individuals closely involved.
As a result of the trade, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would have access to the luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises as it continued to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) companies.
According to the sources, information on the possible agreement may already be published this week, although it is also possible that negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be published because negotiations are not held in public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the comments received and the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise from Miami has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.
Its net sales grew by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when the net sales amounted to $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates in Miami, contains Oceania and Regent brand names, comprising a total of eight cruise ships, and a route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise in emerging economies, such as China and India’s middle classes.
Companies compete to be the first choice for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first issue of shares on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares after the 2007 sale, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was established in its current composition in 2000 with its combined Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the entertainment and casino company of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
According to published data, Genting's share of the company was 28 per cent, Apollo 20 per cent and TPG Capital LP's share 8 per cent from the end of June onwards.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises companies of 82 per cent of North America's cruise capacity is reflected in the registration documents issued by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issue of shares.
The Tampere City Council is dealing with this today.
Animali hopes that the City Government will support this initiative.
According to the Chief Executive Officer of Animala, Salla Tuomivaara, who prepares a doctoral thesis for Tampere University, the time of dolphinariums in Finland and around the world should be completed quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a widespread view that the consumption of developed mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is neither animal protection nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also be desirable for Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination.
According to the threat of death, the death of Näsi-delfin confirms the requirements for the downslope of dolphinarium activity.
The death of the vision is a sad continuation to the dark history of the Särkännie delfinario.
It is time to put a point of death, to shut down dolphins in prison, and to start to find out how Tampere dolphins could be transferred to the bordered sea, to some kind of dolphin shelter, Jutmihaar requires.
It was not possible to experience the return of dolphins to the original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Säränniemi were able to experience even more life than an intrusive concrete pool, Jutmivara hopes.
The Animal Welfare Association aims to prohibit the use of all species of wild animals in circuses in the overall reform of the animal welfare legislation in preparation.
This group also includes dolphinariums.
In support of this demand, the Director of Animal Management, Thomas Vaara, participates in today's 1.9th mental expression on behalf of dolphins.
The mental statement held by the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2300 dolphins are brutally captured or killed each year, either for the use of dolphinariums or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations on a new state with Eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government end the fighting against Separatists in the eastern parts of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the different region, the sources of Russian news tell.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the Separatist-controlled Eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to defend its own rights and interests.
Putin's call to the government of Kiev for negotiations with Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his obvious strategy, which he has been following since the beginning of the violence five years ago: he is trying to help the separatists to take over the territory and thus force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed Novorossian independence, which will allow it to move towards the west of Russia.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to regain the Eastern Donetsk and Luhansk area controlled by the Separatists, which in March and April took over by the Separatists in Moscow, following the annexation of the Ukrainian Crimea, on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently baptized the region as "Novorossija", "New Russia" – this term reminds of the glorious days before the revolutions of the great Russian power.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks are an illusion as long as Ukraine's politicians carry out campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and the government forces attack civilians in areas controlled by Separatists.
"We need to start extensive negotiations immediately, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the State of South-East Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "statehood" is linked to greater independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev Executive when it tries to address the fears of the Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine".
The statement by the Kremlin representative, which was aimed at correcting the 'wrong interpretation' of Putin's comments, stressed that the Russian regime is dealing with the Separatist rebellion of eastern regions in a different way from that of Crimea, where, in practice, it took over the area with a majority of the population of 2 million ethnically Russians.
Moscow would be far more difficult to connect even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because, according to pre-conflict opinions, the majority of the population supported staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international fora would give Ukrainian local governments the right to enter into their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin, in practice, power in the territory that links Russia to Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, which was joined to Russia five months ago, Russia's main fleet is located as well as port areas for commercial shipping and historical coastal collections.
The area between Russia's Rostov and Crimea also has mines, factories and metal insulators that produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, after further elections, consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions that deviate from the Ukraine’s nuclear area on their own economy and language status.
His vision of independence, however, seems to differ sharply from the view of the Separatists of the armed and silt people in Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his last demands to the government of Kiev on negotiations with Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after the invasion of Russian tanks and troops into Eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area on the coast of the Azovi Sea.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novoazovsk, supported by Russians, will be the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategically significant coastal area until Crimea.
It has led to massive civilian and military personnel to strengthen Mariupol’s city. Mariupol, a half a million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port town, located between Novoazovsk and the peninsula of Crimea.
On Saturday in Brussels, Poroshenko asked the leaders of the European Union to take further steps to prevent Russia's future violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon arrive at a point that has no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed additional sanctions to allow them to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine reshuffles in unclear circumstances.
Ukraine's soldiers had to withdraw from their position in the Ilovaisk territory after the transfer of two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers last week to the Donetsk territory in order to strengthen the difficult separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told the journalists on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers on the Russian island of Ilovakis was replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured in Ukraine a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was made by Japanese artist Keisuke Honda at the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half of the year, Sulley Muntari first hit and a little later on, Jeremy Menez took the penalty shot.
Lazio, after his narrowing goal, got a hit at the end of the game, but goaltender Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this period from Real Madrid.
In the training debyyte of the former attacker in Milan, San Siro’s stadium was only half way away.
39,000 spectators were reported to be the audience.
Australian posters and Gabi Grecko in the whirlwind of the naked image scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has reported that he's bewildered by hackers who may have stolen his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko's naked photos.
In the entertainment world, after a large crowd of Jennifer Lawrence naked photos were published on the Internet as a result of a big celebrity hacking scandal.
Hacker has been told to hold a total of 60 naked photos of the star of hunger game Lawrence as well as other superstars such as Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihana, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actor Kirsten Dunst.
The photos of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsk and Grecko living in Melbourne have apparently also been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Ellsten, who proposed Greekko last month, said to the Confidential, "This is disgusting."
All personal communication and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
The Greeko in New York is reported to have commented on the case in the online magazine as "damageful" and said that the victims "are feeling ashamed".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with this previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, among whom also two samples of Palmer on the top of the pool.
The film "Love and Honor" starring Liam Hemsworth is featured in Palmer's film awards.
Palmer, the star of the Chuck series Strahovski and Sucker Punch, Browning didn't comment on hacked images last night.
The representative of Lawrence told the TMZ that "there is a haughty violation of privacy."
The actor Seth Rogen hated the hacker when he tweeted: "The publication of images stolen from the house does not differ in any way from the sale of the stolen product".
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, even from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost like a home field and went to a sensational victory from Cuba at the World Cup.
Look at the pictures of the fan body.
Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red-white, but Finnish blue-white.
According to STT, Finland’s victory was followed by nearly 2,000 Finnish farmers in the Spodek arena.
I felt like I was playing at home.
The big impact on fans had on our game, Finland's captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland was already losing in 0-2 but won in 3-2.
In the fourth installment, Finland performed a miracle behind six points.
Cuba already led the race from 16 to 10, but then the Finns got a charm.
