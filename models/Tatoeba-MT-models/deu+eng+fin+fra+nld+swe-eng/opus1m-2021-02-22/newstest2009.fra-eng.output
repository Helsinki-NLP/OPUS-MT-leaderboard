At the end of the trade, the Prague Stock Exchange went down in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange repeated its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ actions reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchange, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed with its fall the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall of the shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the US House of Representatives vote, which refused to adopt the stabilization plan for the US financial sector, is thus also perceptible to us.
Action drop in Asia
The Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although during the day the indices managed to eliminate some of the losses.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost four percent during the trade, but later it eliminated some of the losses and reduced the decline to almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Hong Kong stock market movement lost 3.8 per cent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney stock market shares lost more than five percent, but ultimately losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about rescue action in the United States will affect financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its own monetary policy, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should soon resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it would be likely that other countries would be affected.
The bloodbath of American actions
Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the proposed financial system support, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (near 12 trillion of Kč).
The legislators thus denied the appeal to the support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. shares lived on Monday, a bloodbath, and the main indices of shares experienced the greatest fall over the past 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced such a fall for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress passed: the U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
US legislators made a decisive move in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance of $700 billion (about 12 trillion) granted to the U.S. financial system.
Success is not so sure.
Before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be reviewed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Says Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, Chair of the Chamber's Banking and Financial Regulation Committee.
According to sources, as early as Wednesday, the plan should be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor for revitalizing financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market support can be effective, a "disillusionment" will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We resolved our diverging views on the form that the package of measures for market stabilization should have," told the Bloomberg Agency, Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
According to her, the final vote could be taken on Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with the American finance minister Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
The company should buy from financial companies the insellable real estate assets that cause financial companies to lose significantly and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to reach agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
This recovery plan still needs to be pursued, but I think we are in it," Paulson says.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has considerable implications for falling stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, Harry Reid did not escape, the legislators are making the Congress final on Sunday.
They thus wish to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first hour zone, where Congress's decision could affect Monday's trade.
For the time being, it is impossible to clarify with certainty when the two chambers of Congress of the United States are going to vote, or if negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by a particular problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will still be subject to many changes.
The total amount to be used by the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if the Congress feels that the program does not fulfil its function, it has the opportunity to block the grant of the remaining amount, following two steps: firstly additional $100 billion and then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may take his or her stand on this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put him or her in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining finance for the buy-back of bad real estate, including the value chuta, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto stated that Mr. Bush was happy with the progress made Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limit of golden parachutes
The Chair of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors from losses, the discount agreement, the progress of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for the limitation of gold parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to monitor the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will walk and be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, who have problems to pay.
The government should negotiate new advances in the case of mortgages that it will buy, while reducing debtors' monthly bills and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance's chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we are unaware of what will be the mechanism and the price of the buy-back of problematic assets.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," says Marek this week at the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is to be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not so important, according to Marek.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, as early as this week, that they support this plan and that they devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological meaning of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is most important at the moment," said Marek.
An intense struggle at the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you on how to choose
While virtually all mobiles know how to read MP3 files, no MP3 drives know to call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
There are sufficient reasons to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end cheap grimophone to put the new album by Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
If there are vinyl discs in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a grimophone.
The same applies to music during travel, i.e. compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
There are also categories depending on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, the same way that a Pink Floyd fan would have trouble supporting listeners bought for twenty crowns in the market.
There are two extremes, among which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is broad.
Battery life is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than simply playing music, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary functions, phone calls and text messages, it is able to read music and movies, record them, it has a variable quality camera and can, for example, be used for navigation.
And if you take Smartphones and communicators into account, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no fridge can grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are practically seeing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The greater the number of functions you use, the smaller the interval between the two reloads.
And reading music is one of the most important energy bowls.
There are few mobiles who are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this number is significantly lower.
In this respect, music players (especially the rudimentary music players) are significantly more performing.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you can call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second reload for the work - this being valid even for the more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players who are capable of continuous operation for at least 9 hours, including the least performing, following reloading.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be connected directly to the computer, without any special software.
Of course, you can save music directly on the memory card, but few card players know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobiles.
As far as readers are concerned, you do not need, except for the iPod, any software.
Just fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the style, or then the judgement of the user.
Some devices only display an index with tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iliver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a specific device, be particularly interested in the battery life, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you will only have any mobile reading the MP3.
Almost all mobiles are able to do so today.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to music formats that the mobile or player is able to read.
Everyone can read the MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will precisely have this format.
It is one of the most common formats and apart from it, the vast majority of the devices can also read WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
Just visit the corresponding web pages of the operator (or of another supplier) from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason for acquiring a musical mobile.
The supply of operators is unfortunately miserable and, in most cases, is limited to fast-made radio tubes.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (either by GSM, the Internet or the wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobility on their own.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get out of your pocket's mobile, while you forgot your MP3 drive at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones on you or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use built-in enclosures, which almost all mobile devices have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical movements is their price.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, you can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also equipped with an input for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Really anyone can order the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest ones (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or of a Gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a random connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose from
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an exchangeable memory card slot (M2, microSD type, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models usually support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones get rid of it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose more specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the control ease approaches that of an independent MP3 drive.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 drives sold separately, is the one that went the longest in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by an MP3 drive produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force traditional operators to lower prices.
Maybe he won't be missed for a long time.
We have already mentioned on many occasions on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The Czech Telecommunications Agency (ČTū), which said that the price of a text message was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the area of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of the Czech mobile operators cheaper than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this respect, Pavel Dvo the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who repeatedly stated that there was no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, is chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network apparently has only a lot of luck (there would be only a few frequencies now).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a significant fall in prices, which was subsequently to be responded to by traditional operators.
However, before even the market entry of the hordes such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, voices similar to those heard at home today were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual Mobilking operator.
In only six months, this operator has managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and become the country's fifth operator.
In addition, behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which includes the Czech U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need much less customers than a traditional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
For example, in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages, which is often offset by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers at least twice as much SMS as its competitors in Britain.
However, as illustrated by Mobilking's example in Poland, relying on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity shot.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator that they like and can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept could also work with us.
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesman for Vodafone, in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which is based most virtual operators.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of service provision."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project successfully, but negotiations in the Czech Republic are not very encouraging.
Mobilking's launch will take place rather in other countries in our area," said Jana Studničková, spokesman for the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were not in any way in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that a potential competitor cannot appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the business customer sector, has not, for a long time, hidden its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We want much to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile services.
And the sooner will be the better.
We have already had negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
Together with some, we managed to make progress in the negotiations," said the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl group.
The future may therefore be promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we might already be able to host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for the moment, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At the moment, we do not estimate that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific ones.
For the time being, no topic with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Srše the Press Department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile Spokesperson Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not registered for the moment a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is virtually impossible for a virtual operator to appear on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate within such a limited time frame, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone instead directs his attention to the completion of the requests for his own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared charges and infrastructure.
This, in our view, means the most input from the customers' perspective.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to discover a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile Internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a fall in prices and therefore a fall in profits.
What is the point of facilitating the emergence of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to agree as if they were going to show. Chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also bears witness to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČTū, during the creation of the U:fon, was that exercised by T-Mobile.
Evidence of this is evidence of publicly available information from the ČTū web pages.
Now, today, the U:fon is willing to serve as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "Competition on the mobile market has also been recently amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and especially its services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disappointing.
However, it is not just the attitude of the ČTū, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (EYOHS).
However, the latter adopted its typical position in the face of this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not been of sufficient interest to conventional operators in the past," said Kristián Chapoplo in response to our question from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
A statement made in this way would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care that no one benefits from its position on the market, such a declaration is more than misleading.
Especially since Kristián Chapau added: "Where virtual operators are normally present abroad, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a fall in prices of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure towards an honest functioning of the market and a fall in prices appear not to be part of the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which derives from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, naturally arises.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to the random and hard fight against competition.
"The Office did not find signs of anticompetitive behaviour in this regard, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore none of them has an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools necessary for the opening of the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even from the telecoms regulator," said Chaloupa.
Interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTū, according to which telecommunications is, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts have a different view: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must always be obtained.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
Thus he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least of concern to the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are doing so in a similar way.
However, complaints from many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Relapsing responsibility on the ČTū is a fairly common turn in communications, through which the ÚOHS washes hands of the case.
We have already met this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to bring about the innovation of the Telecommunications Act, recently adopted, an expansion of the powers of the ČTū in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised to improve the situation.
This is something the representatives of the OOHS must know very well, but their interests seem to be elsewhere.
When nobody looks, it can work
However, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but these are only partially public.
In most cases, there are firms involved in multi-level marketing.
Special mobile telephone services are offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms generally only reach elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company does in front of the operator is a classic business client, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it receives special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you are talking about were to happen, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions that we would consider, which could lead to a cessation of collaboration with the company in question," answered our question on this problem, Martina Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that such an activity would not have reached the managers of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, they may be thousands of customers.
However, the operator does not take a decision against such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring significant benefits, and at the same time, contrary to the real virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators."
That is precisely what should seem strange to the ČTū.
In addition, there is another question to ask at the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to reveal such an activity, and if it does not wish to confine itself to the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the dearest country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought about a significant fall in the price of services.
However, almost in all the countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators tried, sometimes more or less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were almost the same - a market too small, or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in the developed countries have intervened, which did not defend the interests of mobile operators, but of their customers.
Both through formal measures and through informal pressure, they eventually got the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory agencies deal with this issue in the form of a hot potato that is released by passing it on to a near target.
As a result of our experience, we can only get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But don't throw the handle after the cog.
If the background information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear, the Czech mobile market may be moving.
If one operator has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will be difficult to maintain in the face of the rejection (to discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Citizenship Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The hymn was once again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji the Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kn theková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremi, Jaroslav Krček, is the author of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to the Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of the solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"Since the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, have a good saying, so that we understand the words well, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
Kde domov můj recorded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (The Theatre of States) in Fidlovacka (Kermesse des savetiers), Czech original piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škrup.
It became popular and people spontaneously adapted it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
He remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How sounds the "new" hymn
Pragic public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday
On Wednesday 1st October 2008 will be recorded in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Prague Transportation Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will go up in the metro, trams and buses, who instead of having a paper ticket, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon.
At the moment, the card is available for about 100 thousand people, owners of the Opencard chip card.
Passengers may buy a coupon of 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have it registered on their smart card in the information points and offices of Dopravní podnik (the Transportation Agency), located in the metro stations of Muzeum, Můstek, Nádra the Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Latviany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday there is also the possibility of buying coupons via internet on the Dopravní podnik web pages: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who start using the online store can permanently forget the windows in metro stations, where they have so far had to walk impatiently in long tails in order to obtain paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon via internet and they will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is at the disposal of passengers a window with trained personnel, which will help the interested parties with the purchase by internet and, in addition, will record the coupon they bought on their card," says the spokesperson of the Martin Opatrný project.
Next to the libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminding the machines to compost the tickets and the passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
An automaton will check the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and the coupon previously purchased will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
It is known in the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transports from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the Filip Drápal tickets of the Ropid organization, which design the schedules of the Prague public transport.
Periurban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's body.
During boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the indicated location on the side of the body.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"If the passenger would need to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing more simple than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal completed.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and will not remember the date on which the validity of their coupon expires may rejoin the automatic distributors, initially used to record the coupons on the map.
Here, on the camera screen, the information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Sudetes were calling for a referendum in the United States
In 1945, the Germans of the South demanded that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This follows from a letter filed in the collections of Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Southern Bohemian Scientific Library).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of South African Germans were allegedly addressed to the President of the United States with such a desire.
This derives, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
In the letter, Germans from Český Krumlov asked the US President not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region in southern Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have well understood the situation and want to be sure that the words proclaiming that the American troops come on German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, to whom the fate of the Šumava is at heart".
Since the rally in Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only with brutality, unrespectable attitudes, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter pray the American President to take in his hands the protectorate of the Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppressed and destroyed minorities and which in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of millions of inhabitants," is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech Oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sudetes of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to realize that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them had such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to gain some form of autonomy for the South.
Others thought they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chapau, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When, at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to learn Czech.
"They thought that once they returned home, the Czech Republic would benefit them," said Chapau.
According to him, none of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don’t think about it.
An Emotional Campaign Will Attack Drivers
Action for the most expensive road safety in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The Minister's office, Aleš  the Minister, believes that it will discourage drivers of dangerous driving behaviour.
This 150 million-dollar campaign will appear on television, on radio, on cinema, on the Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and from alcohol to the steering wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
She wants to get the awareness of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
The slogan "singing" of the whole campaign also bears witness to this:
You don’t think about it.
The phrase "You don't think" is written in capitals on the license plate.
Then, in a bloodflake, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
What must symbolize is that one can pay for life for a moment of carelessness.
The spots will "hanter" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen commonly with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
The Committee believes that this will lead to a fall in the accident rate and in the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whips against drivers
"What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks need to be brought back to the driver," says Martin Ko the transport psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
The signs indicating the danger to drivers are, in his view, already less effective.
"When a static panel warns against a danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice," Ko then said.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Provisional Government, supported the restitution of almost all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in return for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), if not all," said Olmert daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), because without that, peace will not take place," he added.
He agreed that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all, does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," said Olmert referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he later pointed out.
Retreat of Golan Heights
Olmert also supported Israel's retirement from the Golan Heights, which he felt was an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a Golan retreat," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to give up the constant support that they give to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Kaida (terrorist network), as well as that of jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Issues that arise after the accident: Are the drivers in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of the company Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether the drivers and passengers can travel within the coach during the journey.
"If we want to comply with the law in a strict and formal manner, the activity of a steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by a truck driver who crossed the bus road.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus may have an accident or even a sudden brake, even at the time when the flight driver serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is equipped with standing or not.
If this standing equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Long distance buses Student Agency do not have standing seats; what was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"It's a matter we've been dealing with with with the department and, at first, it forbids any travel of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got it that passengers can go to the toilets during the journey provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law doesn't know how to steer
"There is no unanimous legal interpretation of the steering role - no legal prescriptions are concerned with this role.
On the other hand, there is no legal requirement for the carrier to provide services either.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term "receiver of a vehicle; it does not define its rights and duties," adds Mr. Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, the director of the Department of Road Traffic, believes that the law deals with the problem adequately.
"All depends on the fact that the bus has permission to offer standing places in its approval.
It's all in there," he says.
The buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing seats and a maximum speed, long distance with standing seats and a higher authorized speed and long distance coach without standing seat with the highest authorized maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, said an expert
Jaroslav Hoñn, an expert at BESIP (Road Safety) in Transportation, does not see the flight of flight attendants as a major problem.
"Where there is regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared with that of the service in the aircraft.
Nor is it sure when there will be turbulence and the hostess of the air can tangle his head."
"But if the bus had stopped in a sudden way, the laws of physics would of course be valid.
In the same way as on an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the flight attendants by means of internal requirements," he says, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer the services of flight guides.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the Director does not consider their profession to be a risky profession.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I have the impression that this is a risky profession, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
This would also reduce costs," he said.
The safety concern is the reason given by the director of Asiana Alexeï Litvine, who, in comparison with SA, ensures a very small number of lines in his vehicles.
"We have no hostess. We have opposed it since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end up with a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, to Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy has arrived
A young hostess in the Plze, who had been working for society for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stopband without using a flash and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the latter to try to avoid it by means of a sudden manoeuvre, but he frustrated it on his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the Stewards rest were sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these spaces, they are blocked."
The company intends to complain against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the young girl's family, the Agency will not wait for the court's judgement, but in terms of financial compensation, it will also rely on the guilty party.
Any changes to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the movements of flight drivers on board the bus.
"But it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone on the wheel," said expert Hoñn.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the flight attendants to be something that would fundamentally jeopardise the safety of passengers," concludes the spokesman Hanzelka, stating that the control of the safety of the coaches is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The expectations of the Düsseldorfers are based on Frankfurt.
The key words were not missing in the letter from the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
From a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Deca-Bank de Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the Sparkasse financial group" could be constituted, according to the published letter Monday.
The WestLB would provide a "competence block" with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be a decisive boost to other concentrations in the banks sector of the Länder.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its capacity for action in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, wounded, is still under heavy pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Authority that, only recently, made it clear to the government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that the time was set to seek a future solution.
However, for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - it has been a matter of some form of relationship between Bank Deka, who knows Sparkasse's clients through their investment funds, and WestLB.
Although the head of Deta-Bank Franz Waas reported at the presentation of the figures for the end of August that he saw no meaning in the merger of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, whether it was Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Executive Board of the Deca, half of which is supported by Land banks and savings banks, instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
This could be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, they are said to be in the financial position.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, has one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial position, is playing a role in consolidating the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it was believed that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the Land of Palatinat and Hallab.
Nothing came out of this ternary bouquet, though.
They had hardly been made public that the Land of Hesse was opposed to Hellaba's participation in them.
The other two houses did not join either.
The bank of the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate Palatinat was attached to the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new leaflets on the consolidation of the Deca-Bank with banks of Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, however, opposed any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, there seems to be a growing sense that the consolidation of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria has passed, a BayernLB union with the Bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg could become a reality first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure on new mergers was to increase, the potential partners would gradually escape.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far been more resistant to the crisis than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
On the other hand, Hesse-Thuringe's group of savings and transfers, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, drew a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NorthLB would remain rigorously.
However, such geostrategic reflections reflect only one of the facets.
Another question is how the different commercial models of each bank can fit in.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely which commercial model should ensure the future capacity of the banks of the Länder, had not been resolved by the German group of savings and transfers.
In the end, a WestLb screening could take place, which is obviously not desired here.
This is also referred to in the letter of the Executive Committee in place: in any event, a comprehensive resolution would be required for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer party is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is accompanying her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a tonne of five litres of Kaiser beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival which deep sounds his gosier can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nueva station, four buses take off tonight at 23:45, `destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', expected to arrive at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travelling Brazilians exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, Marco Guarda explains, it's not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat of false fur and goggles with wide silver frames.
For the past five years, they have been going to the beer party, three of which have already been transferred only this year.
They went there by night, stayed the day at the party, and returned at 10:30.
It would involve unnecessary costs to spend the night, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and a head of the German speaking group - Marco has completed a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses run in the night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet in the bus, the travellers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates make yet another break shortly before Munich on Highway 8.
When, in the early morning, the Marco group finally arrives at six thirty as planned at the parking lot near Thérèse Square, almost 50 other buses across Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and others gather together, Marco gives a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First: cover with the small yellow cap.
Dessus is written on the left `Fête de la beer', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco `conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: `When the doors of the beer chapter are opened, one short', Marco shouts in the early morning.
`Curse!' Run and set aside places at the bottom of the tent.
`Be not in front, if not be blocked, and not all the yellow helmets on the same benches, they shall be divided into the room.'
The cup, Marco shouts, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instructions!
Show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they are gone!'
Third: `This evening, come back here at ten and a half hours!' Understand?
And that's where it went to the beer party.
On the road, someone ties yellow helmets to the trees to find the road, the signs and even an electoral poster from a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'week-end of the Italians'.
There are no specific figures; it is said that 50,000 people are getting on the road across the Alps and falling into the beer booth, 10 percent of the visitors would have come from Italy this weekend.
The police in Munich is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian Red Cross who carry out statistics on the countries where the Italians take the lead in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hoffräu brewery.
Nights of sleep for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word `relatively' and that he slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by crisis movements.
This was indeed happening this weekend.
The real estate financier of the Bavarian Hypo Real Estate (HRE), along with the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect itself from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid appropriations are being granted up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate is now expected to pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from private banks as well as from public-law banks.
In the background, it is the Depfa daughter company that supports the losses.
According to a newspaper article, state funding had been refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which was no longer possible since its lack of confidence in markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, while the own capital ratio had also slightly decreased from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net earnings from financial transactions were, compared to the same period of the previous year, at zero point, profits from the allocation of fixed claims and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen from more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it was only because of the significant profits from the reimbursement of the downstream accounting costs arising from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as the repayment of interest on the basis of the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Group companies that the profit deficit of about 16 per cent was moderated.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state-owned financial institution had initially misconjected on real-estate industrial loans, which were subsequently branched to the Aareal bank.
Because conventional state funding was not profitable enough, the Depfa had then become more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint private-state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified projects.
On the value of the daughter-in-law, the Hypo Real Estate is required to make depreciations that are expected to have an essential material effect on the group's earnings and losses, which is still rather unclear.
The fact is that the dividends were amputated.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated by two thirds.
Since the acquisition of the Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a major investor in state and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on inter-bank refinancing since it does not have a customer deposit.
With the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks has again become considerably tari, since banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate requires a part of all Depfa's credits of approximately EUR 50 billion per year for a short-term refinancing period.
According to a press release by the Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing need is met with medium-term credit and the protected company is influenced by the international financial markets that are largely out of reach.
Other sources say that funding would be provided through the funds up to the end of 2009.
On the other hand, the Chairman of the Executive Committee of HRE Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to use financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Institution (Bafin) are based on the principle that Hypo Real Group's market capacity is now assured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank only have to hope for it.
However, there is no certainty in view of the dynamics and importance of the crisis.
It is not unthinkable that funding should not be used throughout its scope.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest announcements, still at the gates of insolvency Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue for the least interim will not be able to reassure the spirits either.
The price of the project fell from 75 per cent to 3,30 euros.
The course of the obligations, on the other hand, is particularly good.
While the debt to the first head has barely moved, secondary loan prices are declining.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former daughter company Württemberg Hypo and those of course who have a life span beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate bank previously seemed to be an alternative speculation investment, their value must now be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself which led to the crisis entering the institution through the buy-back of the Depfa bank.
As long as emission agencies, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that arrears will be absorbed over time.
Or what no one dares to hope at the moment will happen - that the financial crisis can be overcome within the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that approached surreptitiousness has now become a simple hope founded.
This should reserve sleepless nights first and foremost for long-term creditors to decide whether to separate them from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn to constitute a carry-over of losses for the next few years on the automatically collected capital gains income tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop had to show up for the first day at the Tachibana High School, the girls started to laugh: the German was so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Log of Exchanges, she talks about Japan.
"On the first day of class in Japan.
What was I excited about?
Already the way to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to the Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way all by myself, fortunately I didn't lose myself.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be as strictly fixed as in us in Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after the other from eight hours, until nine hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I don't like talking in front of people at all, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I had not yet had the uniform of the school, I put an old skirt of my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue raised socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, therefore, I presented myself in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all made low Masses, laughed and made signs, and I have constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew him already thanks to my mangas.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable to the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "mignon, cho".
Then I quickly slipped to my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the gong was dissolved, I was attacked in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who was better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's hard enough to understand English.
During the break, they all went out of their Bento.
My host mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really different than the miserable German-cases.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sausages, a salad of cucumber and algae, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What is sure is that everything is really good.
All right, except maybe the salty plums are confidant, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento which she has prepared herself, and which is then especially carefully prepared - in the hope of being able to do a little better to the boy during the break.
I read that in my mangas.
I'm curious if I could watch him here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always answered:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading mangas is what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and the culture that is there, at some point I also started to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, us and customs.
And here we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cafard flees from danger, does that mean he also feels afraid?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we check that he feels the same when he behaves the same way we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe the animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as we cannot prove that the other human beings have a consciousness.
But in that case, at least it can be hoped that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or general consciousness, we enter hard-to-work terrain because the Hardware does not correspond.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he kills, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists draw a comparable subjective experience from it.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our experience subjective to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits associated with the human consciousness almost always include the pre-frontal side cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in management and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent from other beings.
At least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the pre-frontal Cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is different even from the other primates.
Another significant characteristic could be the linguistic nature of man: much of his existence is related to language, which often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever its way of being produced, would probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is so difficult to determine what other animals may be aware of.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular Hardware, analyze based on our own experience, then its observation poses us with major problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
The animal consciousness processes could be examined without regard to their content, and that is exactly what happened in short-term studies of primates memory, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the pre-frontal Cortex in the realization of visualisation.
But what is the result of the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a conscious brain of its own activity.
So what we disown as "pear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) accapare of living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely linked to the cortex regions that characterize the primates and especially the man.
Subtle degrees of feeling associated with our volubile nature emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others other than ourselves.
On the other hand, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that sensations from primitive activities arise in the regions of the body sensation of the Cortex and the brain trunk, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could be quite involved in cross-sectional sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe this is inexpressible.
Pankseep is concerned that what appears to be fear in both men and rats is probably also felt as such in both cases: however, how can we check whether rats and men feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroache runs from danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviours are not sufficient to prove identical experiences.
Certainly, nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, however, cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain trunk the cause of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this to man: how can we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is being made in the nervous field, since the same is true in rats and humans.
Because I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I don't know if they exist.
We might consider this to be in the short term, but I'd rather move on rather than constantly screwing myself against a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux to be a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European championships," announced Wasjunik.
"But it's not an amnesty for our country.
The work just started, and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both guests run after the deadlines.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA is constantly watching us."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish PAP press agency.
"We assured the President of UEFA in a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League were already convicted in the previous season for mandatory relegation manipulation; in the end, the beginning of the League was even delayed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant counter-attack
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her ex adult Dennis Quaid.
It flashes - and counter-attacks.
A late Rose war for the ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a dismal battle - in the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the marriage failure: "Dennis was long disloyal to me, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his qualification as an infidel husband was clear: it would be "Monstrous," he said to the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg once again spoils the history of our relationship and manipulation".
It would be more "reciprocal", that "the pain and the upheavals of divorce for each child are re-rejuvenated in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
While Ryan has been living alone since divorce, Quaid has remarried and soon becomes the father of twins.
Thus was his response to the blow: "My life, anyway, continues.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's doing the best."
Prices of airline tickets and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
Flight and hotel nights would have become more advantageous - this is the result of a study by the American Express financial services and travel provider.
The company analysed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and, after rising prices in the first quarter, established a net decrease in earnings in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, nights of hotels have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices rose by an average of 6.9 per cent in 41 of the 48 European cities examined in 2007 compared to 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was marked mainly in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low price of the dollar which led to a "descending desire for travel by American tourists".
Financial spaces such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by lower hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand with a 26.3 percent increase, the record in Europe.
As a result, the trend in flight prices was up in the first quarter:
As a result of the rise in kerosene prices, passengers in economic class paid an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights, which were very fuel-intensive, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of economic-class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, business-class and first-class, however, the price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more markedly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights have even been divided by two according to this study.
On the one hand, the reasons for this fall in prices would be declining economic growth, explains the firm.
The demand would pass out of the ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure for competition from the open air treaty which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of unprofitable journeys, as well as the high number of airlines that would have submitted the balance sheet in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines only in Europe.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With one goal and simple methods, SV Hamburg becomes the top ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find an 11 function.
De Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player returned to the game only late and his shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the cloakrooms of the Hamburg arena.
There was not much going on in the wardrobes, the half-time was over and most of them had rested instead.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received in strategic places.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol has acquired and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the chief coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Of which the orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The practice has failed.
"Not everything was very nice to see today," said Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would have "wanted also be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 in mid-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a head hit successful by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not harm the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Marin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate its 121th anniversary on Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional classification tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take back," said Marcell Jansen.
There is no doubt that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable nature of the first League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debauched from FC Bayern - certainly forms gently, but it does not shine yet.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
In Wall Street, fear is circulating.
The first news of the rescue plan's failure temporarily dropped the Dow Jones by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a bit.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock market index was 10,579 points, with a drop of a good five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock exchange index was at 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The most losing of the Dow Jones was on that American Express date, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No securities could return profits anymore.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs have declined by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilized to buy what is known as spoiled mortgages.
However, the amount must not be paid once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial corporation that may be exchanged in return for price changes in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.
The courses of actions taken in the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not address investors' concerns.
The price of the action of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and draws the Dax to the bottom.
The US Dow Jones index is falling despite the state's financial market rescue.
Spectacular decreases in the rates of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led to a deep deficit in the German index (Dax).
In spite of the federal government's rescue operation and private banks, Bavarian real-estate finance has at times lost three-quarters of its value, but Commerzbank has reported a fall of more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the important psychological bar of the 6,000 points and stood at 5.839 points with a deficit of 3.7 per cent.
The stock markets have fallen to the knees all over the world.
In New York, Wall Street opened with sensitive losses.
Investors feared that the US Government's $700 billion heavy rescue plan could not be sufficient to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809,25 points lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first opening hour.
The House of Representatives of the United States intended to vote on the rescue plan, and the vote in the Senate should follow on October 1.
The other European scholarships also had only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index accused a decline of 3.2 per cent at the moment, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, Nikkei's main Japanese index dropped to 11,743,61 points after an increase of 1.26 per cent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index dropped from 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506,43 points or 3.9 percent and closed to 12,595,75 points.
In the MDAX, the shares of Arcandor fell after the announcement of an increase in capital.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism multinational also indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences theft of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying into space.
Due to soon-frozen fuel conductions, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been a cause of disarray among researchers - the anomaly in gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvring of space probes, through which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, just like the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what surprises researchers for many years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of the way it is expected according to venerable laws of gravity.
Much more, irregularities occur at the speed level.
The probes become faster or slower unexpectedly.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized it with the anomaly of gravity support.
Some experts feared that the theory of Albert Einstein's general relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter due to the curvature of space, could not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the abnormal gravity support using what is known as the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also in the vicinity of the Earth," he writes.
Space scientists have known the existence of black matter only for about ten years.
It apparently originates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other heavenly bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese roamers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-liberation shooting, six hostages were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Negotiations for ransom would be already under way.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnappers' collimator.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently free.
That is what the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media have reported in concert.
The Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the newsletters of the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are moving well and are safe, announced the Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants in the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances around a shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: for example, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
The only thing left was to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" happened.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers had shot down six of the predators in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German woman to one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the article, the predators wanted to free the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be detained until the robbers found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law who threatened suicide
A court was informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, of Stithians in the Cornwalls, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight charges for indecent charges.
The High Court of Truro referred that he regularly read his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, from 5 to 7 years of age during his childhood.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and tied her up before forcing her to do sexual acts, while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornwalls.
Her daughter-in-law left for Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a volunteer of National Trust, was haunted by the abuses that had been imposed on her twice a week.
The Attorney General, Ramsey Quaife, told the court that some friends had said that Miss Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had seemed "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "had lost all hope in life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's beautiful father, who had also written a letter of confession, which ended with "I regularly attached him and bound him".
"I did not abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim should certainly be terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
"This embarrassing saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what is even more surprising is the fact that if she had not committed this act, her story would certainly never have ended in court."
He added: "I particularly stress, as his father and mother describe, the effects of your crime on Stéphanie for years.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet's ministerial officer, who had forgotten top secret documents in June on a train, will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, told the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious sentence of this act, without insinuation of criminal intent.
The BBC correspondent, Frank Gardner, stated that this episode had a lot of people from Whitehall.
"They will have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed shall be accused of a violation of section 8.1 of the act, i.e. of the clause which deals with the protection of information.
. The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of its work related to the Committee of the United Nations
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda and the security forces' resources in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning, and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies facing the bill B&B.
British building companies could have to pay an invoice of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million savers of Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies collecting money from savers, including 59 building companies.
The general manager of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it is "irritable" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are released.
But the interest that will increase at the same time, will be debited each year to the 700 financial companies that harvest the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It's annoying to see that institutions that had cautious behavior now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is stated that each company has to pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will rise to £450million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Building Company Trade Committee, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritable" to see that institutions that have had a cautious behaviour in resuming the real estate market now have to pay for far less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
"We need to look at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent building companies and their members from paying this dirty bill," Mr. Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the whole year, which could double.
Since the building companies are non-shared organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases by up to five pounds per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that it would increase the wholesale price of its milk, from five pounds to a litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows an increase of two pennys in February, and results from a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide whether they are going in turn, increasing prices to consumers.
. Prior to the increase in February, the bulk price of Jersey's milk had been changed for the last time in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a bail application to ex PM Sheikh Hasina, which could thus be arrested on his return to the country.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to grant her her bail because of her trial for extorting 50 million Taka from a business man ($729.000.00) when she was a PM.
This case is one of the many charges brought against it.
Khaleda Zia, the constant rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, demanded that the country's provisional military government first give him its full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of his release were contradictory because if he was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why he could not remain free when he returned to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request that she do not require a security deposit as she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the Supreme Court order"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this security to return to the country to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami party.
She was detained last year after the acting military government took power, but was released in June to look after herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, denied the charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan antipolio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent campaign to immunize against polio, as a result of Taliban-related violence, said the United Nations.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination campaign in all six provinces last week.
But she said she could not reach out to the children of the hazardous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located south.
A United Nations spokesperson said that this has happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the ITV court battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the ruling of the Competition Commission, which would oblige it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that MSkyB's involvement in the past had prevented competition and allowed it to influence ITV unfairly.
BSkyB acquired its shares in 2006 following an agreement in fact to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition by BSkyB of ITV's shares had cast doubt on the effectiveness of ITV's independence, thus inciting the Competition Commission to investigate:
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and the regulator Ofcom were all against this purchase.
BSkyB retorted that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and, on the contrary, was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just renounced its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorneys' case.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to verify the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
This was the result of the report of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, which criticised the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of officers of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Several unsubstantiated unsubstantiated criminal charges have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the withdrawal in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had declared that the prosecutors were dismissed for poor benefits.
But it then emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to attribute a political connotation to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
The U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute the judiciary for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be terminated for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ends up accused of being involved in this case of dismissal, and at the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales's role in this case, stating that he considered him "the first person responsible" for these redundancies, and ended up "abdicing" his role as a leader," remarkablely succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator, Karl Rove, have been criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's wife must be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honoured at the Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said to be "honored" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the hit of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The award ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a limited selection to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly went away.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was traded in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, ranking in the fifteenth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name- has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to heal his heart beat that became irregular, after having collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then he was found a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Sombre Street in the City, often forgotten, and may be soon on sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents do not know how to get to Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it resembles a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to renew Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbours, said to be charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the house paste.
But the Department of Conservation and Property Development of the city that manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighbourhood owner committees, city agency and Avalon Bay representatives developed a proposal to allow the building builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month," said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to return to the small street and install seats there, some would be used by a coffee to which the manufacturer will grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, the voicemail for Avalon Bay, said that although society wants to exploit the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner of it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to make this abandoned corridor open, and to make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city that suggested the sale to it."
Seth Donlin, a voice of the Conservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing, moreover, that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named since 1802, when the legacy of Philip Minthorne's great farm was divided, leaving aside this little piece of land, which has remained since abandoned.
The later entrance of the CBGB, a closed punk rock monument in 2006, has reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo in cover of the album of Ramones" Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
She was full of hardware, hails, barricades, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards the luxury of East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarety- a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be fucked in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who led a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Amerement Nostalgic on A City in the Extinction Process") related the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow ass, dark day and night, and bounded by the doors of a iron warehouse and blinds, full of newspapers of the past week flying along the gulls."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat agitatedly runs to the bottom of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffitis on the walls, a bottle of beer of 22 ounces empty, rests beside newspapers that have just been thrown away.
Some passers-by said that only rarely thought of Extra Place, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, on his side, said he thought that some understated the attraction of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "are taking place in dark, humid and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former California student, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as Good as You thought. Why middle classes should be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favors of the Afghan voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign points out that "Afro-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." is a true fact.
In order to combat these differences, Obama's education program supports in particular among so many other subjects, "transitional bilingual education" for those learning English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends instruction in non-English languages goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are in the vast majority of Spanish, and low income.
More than a third of students, made up of many new arrivals, study English.
Of the CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 state degree of maths expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students completed the English-language art exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to an ingredient other than that advanced by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, a constant capacity assessment, and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here's an example that Mr. Obama could copy, Linda Mikels, the head of Sixth Street, reports, this school has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total immersion in the English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without his class, you wouldn't have any chance of identifying him."
"It works, she observes, "it has worked for us"
Mr Obama should not take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in the other schools composed mostly of Spanish students learning English.
The excellent results of this school speak of them themselves; but policies on education within his party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and his enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama's response.
Although it is in favour of immigrants learning English, Mr Obama recently considered this an insignificant issue, when he proclaimed that we must all stop polemics on the wording of English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he said, "you must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, he should consider with care the models of education that work, rather than disdain them or consider them insignificant.
Oil Nette coup following the news of the world of economics
Oil prices fell significantly on Monday, as people fear that the rescue plan for the financial march will not be able to revive the economy.
The crude oil futures fell by 7 percent, reaching $99.80 per barrel. The Mercantile Stock Exchange in New York, during this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen by over $20 in barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street's financial turmoil, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having experienced an increase of $145.29 to the barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 to the barrel this month, before returning to the deep uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, investors are once again worried despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the biggest of history, concluded this week end by the leaders of Congress.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be prolonged.
In the very last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will purchase the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation," said the government on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have nationalized the European Financial Conglomerate, Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that the frenetic negotiations of this end week, concluded with the rescue agreement, "appeared to have failed to revive the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"the prospect of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a letter to their investors."
"We believe that raw materials cannot escape this contamination.
"With regard to raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand to which extent the American virus would spread globally and in particular, in China."
The analysts of the bank reduced their expectations for next year, given the decline in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, were therefore forced to fall by 20 percent, with oil and gas prices forecast for 2009.
The Party of the Second Time Determinant for the Improvement of Team Record.
After spending more time in the last eight seasons than anyone in Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he saw everything.
He looked at the second time when the jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like that before," said Ellis.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals have dirtyly played under dark clouds.
Then the back quarter Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a back corner fell and the second, 10 seconds from mid-time.
"I'm not out of my zone" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"it's a mediocre player"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played the catch, the defense fought the Cardinals' quarter back, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and scored 32 yards until touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the balloon escape because of Warner.
Last change, the loss of Bowens balloon, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking advantage of 34 to 0.
It was best the Jets could have scored in time.
"The Jet Coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "second time or third time?"
When they told him the two- the jets left 21 unquestionable points in the third time- Mangini said, "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time more than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, exceeds its world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of his title as the best racer of the century, after beating his own record of the world at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59 of an accommodation race on the stage, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26 in 27 seconds, last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or world record for any distance of 1600 meters from the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed Beijing's Olympic marathon, fearing that it might be exaggerated in today's eyes, that air pollution would increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
Under almost perfect sunny conditions, 48 degrees initially, 55 at arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track riders such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into bottom riders, have contributed to the decrease in the record of the marathon over the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that they suffered from cramps in the mole two weeks before, and that they missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain brilliant, but not rusted.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"It was perfect.
I returned last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end everything went for the best."
He was particularly accused of Kenya, where the African rival is from Ethiopia, where he had to orchestrate his races too much, avoiding the global marathon stars, actually counting on the hips as if they were in a track competition, and considering world records more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a background rider.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. to midway.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
At a little more than three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final ascent to leave Kwambai, which finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record by five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, surprised everyone to win the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing Games because of a bad hypothesis on her back, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She used a good strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan riders to take a nice advantage, then exceeding about 18miles 1⁄2 afterwards.
Ashkele Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Orgueil and the Tests of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its vast park, a few miles from the sun, the brilliant and giant Orlando, there is a small quiet town where pride and the complications of the Afro-American experience arise.
" Eatonville, the first fully black city to integrate, the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description it made in 1935, is no longer so easy to make today." The city at five lakes, three shorts of croquet, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
She has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival, which is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes- became touristic thanks to her inclusion in the Florida tourism guide edited by The Depression- your Federal Writers' Project- remains a place apart.
She is also independent, worthy, and private that she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the black rural population in Florida was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing us so little, doesn't know what he's losing".
Although it is the year of a black president's election, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the issue of race, remains very cautious about foreign affairs.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59-year-old, resident of the city, and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"It needs to be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of blacks taking power and a community of nearly 2400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point, but also an example of southern black rural culture- a few times defamed, other times acclamated- which reminds us of the birth of American slavery.
Which would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the whole world through sincere, dialectic books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which leads to chapter of black history and human tragedy.
Audacious like a big box in life as well as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"passing the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern public school brown and white, with its well-preserved gardens and playing areas, of which Howard Miller has always taken care, although he hardly knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as everything that can be used for people of passage.
Thus, in barely a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It was not, in fact, a portrait that everyone appreciated.
Zora well described the reality " said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's young girls that Hurston immortalized, quoting uncolored songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added, "some people didn't like it."
We still remember Hurston as a lively and eccentric person, who often came back after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on board a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told us, while many were mocking her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also adds, swinging in his chair of the posterior patio that gives to Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, nor plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or heritage she offered to the world," said Valérie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted a five-way highway to be passed to the city to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the community's main two-way street.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in his history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the race mix dispute led hatred to the gates of the community.
"At that time, a group of young whites came to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a lady died."
They launched a watermelon of their car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glorious of my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and undermined youth confidence.
"The black children used to be kissed- I remember it- we kissed our master in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, and Chief Director of the Safety of the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
It lasted, she added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white- I mean there's a line of cultural demarcation here," said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have allowed to create space for many other black Zora Neale Hurston writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as it, armed with joyful confidence and lines of conduct such as: "How can they deprive themselves of my company's pleasure!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's anonymous grave and began fighting to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, brought her back to American canons.
The highway project arrived just when Eatonville's most famous daughter found her attraction.
And this time, the old Hurston neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began to organize a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many came back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the motorway proposal.
"The five-way highway fiasco, extremely fast, a true civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summarized the reporter that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the motorway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has attended our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A mono theme library (of course named Hurston) will be working on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard in 2006.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: at six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a posterior back street during a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
( today there are 90 percent blacks)
The foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, his reason for being, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things - like the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a brave teacher who has a weakness for bright red, are still afraid that their island community is well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
In particular, young people tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston's entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, no better or worse, but also proud, creative, bulging, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is well of the sincere civic affection that we hear in the 18-year-old nephew of Mr. Franklin Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11 years old, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned the description Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, who pass through this area, will think:" Oh, this city has not compared anything to others" Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone is constantly talking about finance.
Despite everything, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosk and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they're in the cyclone's eye.
Never could they think only in the glass and nest offices above their teat, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York spend the worst "working day in the office" since the 1929 crack.
The delivery companies continue to flout on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
Latino always drags between residential buildings, such as mules, about 50 luxurious shirts hanging on a yoke set on its shoulders.
Office employees continue to pick up their morning sandwich to the ambulance merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. a week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the totally pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I was planning to work late in the afternoon, because I discovered my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, some twenty people who were tailing.
Not in front of the cashier's counters, or to withdraw from the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where the usual clients ordered their checkers, the tourists asked the management for the Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I'd later learn from Starr, my authorized personal banker, all tailed for the same reason I did.
Not in the same way, as they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They removed their money from the savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that only operate in a state, and that say treat clients like their families.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have been bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327-capital bank used the bankrupt trustee, and while the New Yorkers returned home for the weekend ending this Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and shop employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential problem, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, that is, the one that makes the most rescue in Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my Chinese local supermarket speaking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and of his skinny director general Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetables merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to risk it."
Profaned Muslim tombs while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organisation of "Citys against Islam" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs depicting red-striped mosques.
The Police accuses extreme right-wing extremists of having profaned an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the end week of the victory of the extreme Right-wing political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to the police, an organized action.
The offenders painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; the detectives however believe that this could have been done to disguise the feeling of hatred of extremists towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be in some way related to the elections.
A voice of the Islamic local community said to be "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this profanation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that touches its end.
Austria is seriously thinking about returning to its courage, following its oscillation to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two extreme right-wing parties, which have raised almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobes.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against the wearing of the scarf and the burkas, and even expressed his opposition to the food alaha.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter forbids travel abroad.
The courts banned the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed his intention to go to Spain through France to the authorities under his control.
Police in Kent had granted this travel ban last Thursday after proving to the magistrates Glitter's guilt for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, or by his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in the limited court of Ashford, but was nevertheless represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court-proceeding voice said "Thursday, 25 September at the Court of Ashford, the Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't present then."
Glitter, 64 years old, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be registered on the lists of accused of sexual abuse.
He or she must inform the authorities if he or she wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
In addition, he must inform the police seven days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve up to five years of imprisonment.
Kent's police said it would not discuss any specific cases or the potential displacements of Glitter in the story.
The Kent Police Department said, "The Kent Police will do all they can to protect our children like those from abroad.
"According to us, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, much more effectively.
"Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the most expensive intention for the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls, 10 and 11 years of age, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he declared that he was not feeling well, and refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him to passport control, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused to enter their territory, and were forced to leave Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on August 22, and, while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Limited Court of Justice, West London, for the registration of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom for the detention of images of abuse of children.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior stated that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travel to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let'
The essence of the great masters of the flamenco, released from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On one side the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers at intimate gestures and stolen gazes of artists who do not care to go on stage.
German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some productions with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less-known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes over the particular iconography of the flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... by captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a unique character.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the personality moments of the flamenco stars ".
With the festival "Chant populaire des Mines", Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a flat camera.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the equipment, evokes classical photography.
The implementation of various stylistic means breaks down with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of the flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
This is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the public with his art.
The search for essentials and magic has been the constant of this work presented today at the El Fotómata Gallery.
The flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project has turned into a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a collection of portraits exhibited in the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people, knowing them and being able to enter their lives for a moment more or less long.
I believe that in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You're in front of people, characters that sometimes you don't know or that just leave you a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas reality."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco called "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 on the rue de la Mata (a parallel street to the People of Hercules) which will be open until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true bold"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to making progress on the new project on which he is working, a novel that has as its main character Roger Cassant, an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in the Congo and has passed through the Amazon.
The favourite of the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it is "a true boldness" and that "all shows that it should not write it".
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the Festival for the Exchange of Ideas and Thoughts, which for four days saw scrolling in the city of the aqueduc about 100 writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award in the majority of the participants, made the theatre Juan Bravo a comfortable room.
The festival's presenter, Félix Romeo, was confronted with a fascinated audience who did not see the past time during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great amount of humour, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst for reading" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote of a "very methodical manner" thanks to an intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to deal with his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his novels.
Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it has "effects" and "in less like people", because the writers were asked "not to let go of the frivolity" and assume their vocation.
Bad weather spoils Pozoblanco's fair
The feast of the banders who finished the bull races of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse toreadors verified that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather has stuck to this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled bull race.
In the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the arena of Castilblanco
So only Friday's party took place
Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after having made movements of arms in front of the bull with taste and aesthetic.
The afternoon even Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banderilles planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered gradients applauded more than his fight in himself with the bull.
Worse still for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without trouble or glory.
During his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours less than 10 in the morning.
Euskadi Police Traffic Control (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Armiñan Community (Alava).
The police arrested two occupants of a van, and the latter two were fleeing.
Its loading, more than two tons of hachisch, from which to stop them.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupying officers, a 28-year-old man, identified as A. A. J., according to information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and document falsification.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle control on the N-1, at the border of the Army Commune.
They were preparing to stop a van to inspect him when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and control began.
The police began to pursue them until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further on the coast, where the two occupants came down to flee into a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The posterior part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish balls and then transferred to a police station for a comprehensive inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration plate had been "falsified" since it did not coincide with that written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with an offence of falsifying documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee, A. A. J., 28 years old, was warned against taking the various steps and will be tried within the following hours.
The actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effect of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place television series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw him do strange manoeuvres by trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, according to what a spokesman of the California Police patrol revealed in People magazine.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was deeply supporting the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and walking backwards several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who at first had not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and left her vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She seemed to be disoriented," that's why the agents drove her to the drug and alcohol center to carry out a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was eliminated from the beginning, although "according to the observation of the police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested being suspected of having led under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 19.00 hours and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was detained to treat herself with a nervous depression.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the Left Union to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator and Member of the Left Union, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Advisor in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing favors for members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the behaviour of the political party that he will have to adopt in the city council in Seville.
However, the Left Union leader asked that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "The Left Union has always defended such cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict codes of ethics for all civil servants".
" Sangre de Mayo", the ossified bet of Garcia
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci re-creates the famous Spanish battle against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker has tried "to portray the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" which he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film lasting more than two and a half hours, "Sangre de mayo" will be released in the cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
Great admirer of Galdós's literature, José Luis Garcia assures us that with this shooting "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago, to film a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrid, something he has always accepted when the story held on to national historical facts.
The EUR 15 million provided by the Community of Madrid constitute for Garcia a "one-time opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain who has deceived himself as the leader of the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Captaine Alatriste" or "The ghosts of Goya" - more than twice that obtained for "Sangre de mayo"-, because he could not shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated during almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of the actors, with whom he used to repeat before starting the shooting and to whom he did not make casting, since it seems to him "smooth" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four times the Oscar candidate (he won one), Garcia considers that the three films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, "Sangre de mayo", "Seven French billiard tables" and finally the winner, "The blind sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "that would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this film Garci doesn't expect a prize.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you're working only for prosperity, and now you're just making a movie in addition," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the skin of the sevillaine dancer Tórtola Valencia
A sevillan dancer will pay tribute to an equally sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and a Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three, will live in London with his family.
He was a free dance dancer and a specialist in eastern dances.
She had an exciting, pioneering life for the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and argued for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
This woman's life, which marked the history of the interwar dance in Europe, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered to interpret the sevillaian dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of the flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban popular dance and "the serpent dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers," she says.
The performance was made thanks to two outstanding contributions: the one by Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done at "La puerta aberata"; and the one by Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally well wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tórtola into a mature character.
I'm happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me."
The production also took place thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of such artists who were considered divas".
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who has exhibited herself in such distant places, especially at the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she was usually living in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it is these women who have tremendous influence in their times and now no one knows and highlights her work," Bayón says.
The show will start at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Trinity
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Recently Married Poet" in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Trenat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress which took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after having travelled to the different Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia has bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometime God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it".
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice", and illustrates the despair of American cinema and the whole of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar
He hasn't been running since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard shot for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels exceeds all expression, and now I've lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets were afraid, the American opinion fell very low, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, it remains to human beings only admiration and there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied an ideal of beauty and truth for everyone.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the advocate of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the drug fight created in honour of his deceased elder after an overdose and the creation of his own biofood brand.
It was a victory for a country that had difficulty imposing itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration sweeped Hollywood without paying attention to either nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He placed the bar on top of us," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who is trying to break through the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious private life and far from the goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle today.
But there is one who is trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom he was faithful even if the opportunities were not lacking for him not to be.
"But why should I eat a burger outside of my home, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"With all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as the devoted husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and philanthropist," he says.
Madrid in the race for the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, that could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors during the race, they would be the subject of an elimination note.
But let's look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Errors begin with the removal of dosards, which requires you to go ahead.
This is not bad but if they let you move it would be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for races).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the dosard (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the jersey (second error, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy small-sized jerseys with less fabric and less expensive?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait for more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults took place in the barracks.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be included in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which, I think, did not properly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect race, it would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O.
Microsoft looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emergent Technologies conference Microsoft was introduced a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move in the company campus) in response to what was requested during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remember which posts they occupy - and listen to and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them together according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person, but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and she tells her to answer her in a few moments.
All of this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things on which to focus, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and there will no longer be as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has continuously added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is Google’s first move to compete in Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary as this is the essential basis for the understanding of computer hardware and software.
He takes on the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear but the "death" of the operational system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
You just turn on the computer to spin Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who use half the applications provided with the system?
Which can be the least.
And Windows 7 will need to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, congested months, less complex.
For the time being, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, in fact, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article, was taken early this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the drink distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come out at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But being late for Android's launch and already in the market iPhone will cost them.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso put him on the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio carried one in the 'blood diamond' of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in 'The Sponsor' of Francis Ford Coppola and was part of the association of muscle gays.
And if we were to list all its apparitions, we could also mention this mustachu costaud that raised weights in an ambulatory circus.
It's not just a simple dress of men's body in cotton, molding and without sleeves.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as ' Marcel' - who has to deal with the sport since he takes the name, according to the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel ' s excellent cotton, its uniform cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (not yet recognisable) distinguish it from the other ones that the most famous body jerseys have in the neck.
But beware, because the Belgian brand not only produces top tanks.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothing designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mom; the candidate does not worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
It was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important awards of fashion that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have even created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we are very inspired by it for our collections.
I love walking around in town and watching women watch how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you are a very versatile woman: isn't it?
I think that yes but ultimately everything joins and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I liked it; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look into my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the park of attractions.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the actress role, when you put on the clothes, it's when you really put yourself in the character's skin.
So, it's all tied up.
You haven't had a long time 30 years: has it been hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are happy.
I think the woman is more mature, has more experience and tastes life with less problems.
I'm not afraid of the biological clock.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since I was little and that gave me a lot of internal happiness.
So, you think you're gonna be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to become a young mom; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
It's true, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I look forward to the films 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo'.
See what you'll think of it...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get up on the bridge to make the model.
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in a charity show in London for her association for the support of women and the clothes we're showing - I've exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold on auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a tender-hearted person.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things are not true.
In addition, this so good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to scroll for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make the poach, I would still have done it.
The important thing is to make life better for third-world women.
The alcohol recidivists on the wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcoholosis, to have a system in his vehicle that prevents the vehicle from starting in a state of drunkness, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now reflected in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its aim is the rehabilitation of the driver by offering road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State responsible for road safety, as well as the Directorate General for Road Safety and the Technological Institute for Motor Vehicle Safety Foundation, will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a drunk state, the car resumes.
Alcolock would avoid this, since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the throat and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's rate of alcohol is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is more than EUR 1,000 and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a 2007 study in the United States showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced the offences by up to 65% during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people each year.
This measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: dealing with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, but criminal reform requires a reform of the organic law.
The scheme is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one for experimental use.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install in school buses this system as it has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 1740 precise, official scheduled time, the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias travelled landed in the presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of the night to lie down but its rays still forced the hand as a visor to see the royal couple come down from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier, I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Oh, very well, so we can't go to the airport to take customers at this hour... are you from here or so...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years.
- Oh, good.
But the Mexican press knows very well who are the Princes of Asturias and knows the importance of the trip.
They are several to wait in the hangar of the airport near the red carpet and a military row consisting of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when to her, has hair in the wind, is dressed very sober and does not wear his usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told him that a storm threatened.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before going to the room where the official cortège awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the city's four largest hotels, a funny Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no place more appropriate in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is surely no designer living more extraordinary and good than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of the new talents of fashion.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the Mango window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried for emotion.
Of course, it is the second largest brand store in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1.335 square meters of surface area.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the designer Valentino, president of the competition jury, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at opera Garnier de Paris.
The presidential table prepared by Mango, with the extraordinary Chagals family as its neighboring table, seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and making against bad fortune a good heart, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a mango garment and some ELAH ornaments, which cut off the breath, and arms on top, arms under with her son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in her honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a galant man, and the Baron de Rotchil finished the evening without jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself at the store with a pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner was metamorphose by wearing a long sexy and black dress, moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of the ballet rehearsals and remembering the good old days, she seized one of the bars and she made the gesture of a 'big fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace dependencies, but she showed us photographs of her son on her cell phone before.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man who moves on the motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked in advance, that there are no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, here's life.
1001, anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to crown it all, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the libraries on September 30.
The morning wakes us up almost when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse when we think at agitated pace that we impose the present life.
The office is synonymous with tension and back pain.
Stress represents the evil of the twenty-first century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga, classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to each taste and time.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at the libraries directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain peace in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' is a denial of such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural revenues that help to relax.
If adrenaline does not run into your veins to restore your body's balance and if stress has become a problem, it's time to sit in the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking and Sleeping
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens can surprise you, but in reality it doesn't matter.
It is a blessed change in sleep called sleepiness.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one who talks during the night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadicly (for example, once in life associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other changes in sleep such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (pipi in bed) or somnambulism, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong fever, stress or overexcitement.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, whispers or, on the contrary, with screams, tears, long speeches ...
In the event that sleepiness becomes very common, it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check whether there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for the problem.
We have said that this is a blessed alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another change in sleep that can be treated (e.g., if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, seek quiet games and avoid more or less violent television programs or series.
With very nervous children who have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleepies appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he talks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not try to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because by sleeping, he's not conscious to be able to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so you pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can interview him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even kidding.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the path of victory on his field after a long period of diet.
Without a big game, the Yellows and Blacks created the greatest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for winning the game.
The rhythm was not very sustained during this encounter where the attackers had trouble expressing themselves.
After an initial attempt by the visiting captain Kaufmann who frustrated the lucarne on a shoot from a distance, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascending and turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn above, Romain from the end of the foot or Diebold came chattering the defense of Dannemarie.
On the other hand, we were in the middle of the ground and we just left him moving Riahi at the point of the attack.
The beginning of the second half of the time was going to be decisive with first two Riahi and Temporale signed occasions for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to take back a bullet pushed on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the Illhousian scorer will not be able to enjoy his happiness long and will be forced to return the vestibule a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose big problems to an Illhousian Eleven who just stepped back a little to "compact" his defense, apart from in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big crash, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy to meet angry fishermen
Before flying for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to make a detour through Brittany.
In the face of the demonstration of the strength of fishermen who severely disrupted the access of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit, which falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the upswing of diesel prices, which reached a record of more than EUR 1.14 per litre on average.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesperson, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses recover from competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing plugs of nearly 10 km.
The pleasure port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle Island did not stop.
A filtering dam was set in motion on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits in the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports in the Atlantic and Channel façade, such as the Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where trawlers have remained at docks, or in the Havre, where about twenty vessels have blocked the movement of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the major Total Donges refinery in the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" has to decide on Tuesday's follow-up to the movement and its participation in the planned interview with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go" and "do not want to move to Paris", for example, announced Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas oil taxes, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but believe that the profitability threshold for a vessel is only reached with a gas oil of less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Beautiful
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died from cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes praised the movie legend and the committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian airliner is on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the recession threats that are planning on the world economy.
The fourth global aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 delivered aircraft, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its President.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot of the Chinese market, especially for its planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider assigning more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have released, is considering transferring more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that has been advanced to it, according to the Dominical Edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its life insurance to the international and its retirement activity in the United States, specifies the newspaper which cites sources close to the file.
AIG's board of directors met Sunday in the evening to discuss possible cessations, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp. Air Leasing subsidiary, its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company, and its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity, add the FT.
No final decisions were taken on these divestments, continues the FT.
AIG must quickly achieve liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders.
Analysis Paris History of the session Morning Meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson Plan of Bank Rescue: Dow Jones lost 6,98%, which is an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9,14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.
The Nasdaq, a technologically dominant index, gave 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1.106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection by the Bank Rescue Plan Chamber of representatives to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, the representatives refused to the Secretary to the Treasury Henry Paulson the means he asked for.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market is counting on this," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days will be "too late".
"If the project is indeed moribund (...) then the relay will be quickly transferred to the Fed (the U.S. central bank, ndlr) and to the other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, economist at Global Insight.
And with more emphasis on the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, Mrs Piegza stressed.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities organized the buy-back of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, pushing for emergency responses to banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which show that markets face "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis", the analyst from FTN Financial added.
The bond market has grown sharply.
The yield of the Treasury bill to 10 years decreased to 3.632%, compared with 3.827% on Friday night, and the yield to 30 years to 4.161%, compared with 4.357% on the previous day.
Obama, winner at the points of the first duel
At the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House followed another to know who, John McCain or Barack Obama, took him away.
Not surprisingly, the Republican and Democrat campaign QGs proclaimed their own victory in this television duel, which would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, although honourable, was not sufficiently "glorious" to allow him to halt his decline in presidential five-week polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll was published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point advance (49% versus 44% in McCain), found that it was the Democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
Indecisive voters, who count, Obama was the winner for 39% of the pollers, while 25% of them gave McCain the win, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm its advance Thursday with the expected good performance of his co-author, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's got good instincts," however, Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The septuagénar McCain has been constantly highlighting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while underlining the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he also assured.
An attack angle tortured since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama pointed out that he represented the future.
Without dismounting, he proved to be concise and precise.
He has highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still did not understand, while Obama, if," retorted, this weekend, a Democrat spot reproaching the Republican for not taking all measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American street."
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama, yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered for an electoral meeting in North Carolina in a rainy rain.
He did not even say the words "average class" or "worker"." The financial drain clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans to be the most able to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The coming week could be a decisive turning point," said the influential Senator Democrat Charles Schumer yesterday.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would still be possible to reduce taxes by 95 per cent of Americans despite Wall Street's suicides, Senator de l'Illinois also pointed out that the realization of the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energies was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a 45 nuclear power plant park by 2030.
Prudents, the two candidates have raised questions regarding the financial rescue plan of $700 billion (EUR 470 billion) adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "You noticed there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents appeared on Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusns met on Sunday evening from the close of the polling stations on Minsk Central Square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Lukachenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they did not even vote: "What good, since they will do what they want from my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the good-looking regime for foreign observers with a view to re-establishing language with the European Union is ready to carry out a democratic turnaround.
Sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if those elections were considered by observers.
They have not been so according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the deployment," said Iouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is that it counts the voices, and here we are the executive.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and proposals for laws."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, comes into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, does not recognize the validity of the vote.
She stressed that the attendance figures appeared to be too high, and that the generalization of the advance vote (26% of voters in Minsk) had opened the vote to all manipulations.
"You noticed that there was an election, you?" asked social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five members of the opposition in parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night fell on the square of October.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
Interview - Blood back safe
Hema-Québec was celebrating the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to be happy because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public's confidence, which had been seriously shaken by the blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and the grailness of the public, the Government of Canada launched in February 1994 a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster to cease to occur.
While Judge Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan for a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, only 38% of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field during the following years have been made to regain public confidence," she proudly stated, saying that, at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile".
From its creation on September 28, 1998, Hema-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, were being reported in Europe, which has held the strength since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when one does not know it and a serious disease can result from it, namely Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by the degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death, exclusion measures were introduced.
As a result, in April 1999, the blood of people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
However, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted by blood.
This episode has shown us that the precautionary principle that has been applied makes sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV testing emerged on the market: nucleic acid tests (NATs) which allow the presence of the virus itself in donor blood to be detected directly and not that of antibodies to the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs were able to shorten the mute period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
This significantly reduced the risk that some donors will be infected without knowledge and that they will not be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, 1 in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, this will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that it is now convenient to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover from health," says Hema-Québec's Chief Executive Officer.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year appeared on the island of Réunion the Chikungunya virus, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Hema-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
"Requirements are increasing because the population is ageing.
Since anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often require recharge in red blood cells or platelets.
Population ageing also has consequences on the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
However, any healthy person, aged 18 and over, who meets the eligibility criteria, can give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria is present, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of donors as they age and can no longer give their blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but above all to hold them back and to encourage them to become a regular donor.
Since today's life is so horrified, there is rarely time to spend an hour giving her blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is filled with blood from stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample and plans to take more than a thousand of them annually.
We should start by proposing these for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed to be unable to access it," Hema-Québec is unable to offer this complex and expensive program in all the hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Half-Final Impact
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday at the second and decisive match of the quarter final series at the Stade Saputo.
The midfield Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After a first, aimless half on both sides, the midfield David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other nets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to defeat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
It should be remembered that during the first round of the round-back series on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, downtown Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the back game to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the half-final round 5-4 to total goals.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Victorious Purpose of Kovalev
The Canadian Number One trio is ready to begin the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 Canadian win against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the encounter, scored one goal, Plekanec raised two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to make too much of it in the first period," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He's had a nice ovation."
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the launch of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the General Council of the Liberal Party finished, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to elect himself on the occasion of today's partial election.
"Repussing the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the headlines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a sort of imaged Moulin.
Turned in loop, on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydro-electric dams, mining, from Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Major means, as well as in the election period.
On the press point, the Prime Minister refused to exclude him from the election this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "North Plan" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the recent Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, merely explained why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give a deadline, amounts of investment, or specific priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues to what could be further developed: in particular, hydropower, the forest, but above all the mining sector, baptized by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's list.
This "territory twice as large as France", "is home to us, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it at home, but it's within us," he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founder myth.
Quebec built a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press point.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat that position on behalf of the government," he said.
Furthermore, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said by talking about the north-west passage, which will open all year round due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupied territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP of Ungava) have already begun consultations with about 30 communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has played an important role.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerned, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal Prime Minister who preceded it.
"As the Liberals before us, we have thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Lesage, who made the revolution calm and the nationalization of hydropower, in Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party managed to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In the press, he referred to another Conservative reference to John Diefenbaker's Roads to the North programme, which was the prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest pointed out that it was planned for 2012.
"It remains there between us, but I expect to be there," he said to his activists, causing them applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably no election in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a vote this fall, as permitted by law.
He points out, however, that his schedule was filled, in particular by a mission from the Federation Council to China and a summit in Quebec-New York.
The General Council for the End of the Week provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ called in particular for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and that they would be entitled to veto the decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcomed the main lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
The Pequist Chief, Pauline Marois, noted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, had renounced its application.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutin who is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The DHQ expressed support for the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what we're hoping for is that it's not just a show," said the leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - Unhonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (Irony) in Harper's firm, who allowed herself last summer to say from Louise Arbour that she was a "hont" for Canada.
So reproach this woman who has waged a constant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration as much on the environment of the Prime Minister as on Stephen Harper himself.
We are faced with a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its national in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the events he was accused of.
The only government that, despite Canada's signature to the Geneva Convention, renounces its word and allows a child soldier to grow under inhuman conditions.
The only one who relies on a court order to assess the guilt of the accused.
It should be recalled that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, inter alia, advocate for the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to ensure that he enjoys a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are currently witnessing an iniquitous erosion of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', a word that Harper continues to brand and which sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morale anymore: one can malign, torture, arbitrary imprisonment of a Canadian citizen according to the will of a leader of a minority until now (whichever happens after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine.
In pursuit of a Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest aurior company has initiated a defamation charge of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the need for the aim of launching a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to lead to the ruin of anyone who dares to support a position contrary to their own?
No matter what the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable money to prepare their defences and to fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers backed by pockets almost without a bottom of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is also often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will shatter the opposition as well as scare anyone who dares to look at the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Unlike many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually through the exchange of ideas and not through battling.
It was therefore sufficient to open his books, his files and establish a real debate through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while ignoring the views of the same public.
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this word refers only to the fatly paid lawyers, not all Canadians; that's a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What doesn't - or doesn't want to - Barrick Gold is that the public supports Black Canada's authors and publishers because it rejects the brutal way of mining.
This audience is willing to hear and judge Barrick, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, not in the context of what several people perceive as a prosecution (as a result of the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed an appeal against the authors of Black Canada asking them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreptitious speech, Barrick Gold's pursuit is a direct attack on freedom of university research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in a block, the right to quote credible sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which constitute the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that bother the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under repeated prosecution, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has the right to reply.
The academic community to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's excessive prosecution clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time governments put in place mechanisms to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, have finally reached an agreement yesterday on the greatest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months is still to be endorsed by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by elected officials of its implementation, for new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, for new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default of payment, and for a right to look at the wages paid to the managers of the assisted enterprises.
The U.S. Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush Administration representative Henry Paulson.
"All has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis in Wall Street," explained the democrat.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not, trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to a sprint in the last few hours, fearing the effect of a new failure on the mood of investors.
The deadline was the opening of the markets this morning.
Together with the negotiations late, the two candidates for the US presidential election were more in favour of the agreement, but they did not fail to express their dissatisfied that it was necessary to reach this end.
Senator Democrat Barack Obama has attributed to the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including the provision to allow owners to keep their homes and the provision on the salary of government-backed business leaders.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no welcome.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American television waves.
Asked if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The broad lines I have read [show] that this is something that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of not doing anything is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan is designed to buy with taxpayers' money the suspicious, risky and insellable debts of US financial institutions.
After 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (subprimes) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (ACCPs) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and to the unbundling of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans who had the first draft agreement capped last week.
It is believed to be out of this deadlock since the Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round out the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to assume losses for five years with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover.
The new plan provides for the first instalment of 250 billion, to be added to 100 billion if the President deems it necessary.
Another 350 billion is expected to be approved by another Congress vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will receive shares in the saved companies that will pay him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the torment is over.
The federal government will have the option of delaying the housing seizure procedures for real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as setting limits on compensation and departure payments to managers of affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see him put to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green fire.
Indeed, votes continued yesterday against this project, both in the Republican camp and in the Democratic Party.
"Of course, Washington does not hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee to his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists of taking advantage of taxpayers".
The leader of a small group at the Congress called "the caucus of skeptics", the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to us, saying that the Congress is being asked not to press ahead and to carefully examine the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe once again demonstrated the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three countries of the Benélux announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had not acquired its competitor in the cold since it lost EUR 2 billion (US 2.9 billion) in the US crisis of risky real estate loans.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos.
In exchange, there is a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something that savers and households now appreciate that times are coming up uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be in the process of nationalising another bank that was misguided by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take back on its behalf all current loans to the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
Its beauty in the eyes of azur was long its card asset, of some will say its weakness.
Had he been released from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
Its impurity, sensitivity and talent, which flowed from a source, will also have removed it from the power register that bears the true sacred monsters.
But what a great racer!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday at 83 years of age from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of America's fast-growing cinema.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked and of which there was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of the freedom and blasphemy of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
Of these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate brand of quality.
For in him there was a whole country, drawn from the self-made man, from the fighter of the Pacific war, wounded to the battle, which in the early 1950s studied the dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theatre, on television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who fought for civic rights was also the car driver who finished second in the 24 hours of the Mans in 1979, doubled with a six symbol, although a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadows of this secret, discreet, committed star, allergic to the bursts of the show-business, which will not have been completely pierced by the enigma.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman brought dizziness to the filmmakers this weekend, while his major roles on the black screen of memories were intertwined.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual transformation parades through it.
Back to memory the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, an offender, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, taken back after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly malfrat in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
A bitter and venerable pool player in Robert Rossen's beautiful The Hustler (1961), he will take over the character on his return to Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 on nine appointments.
This face through the ages was him.
Again.
The ages are moving through its course.
Young people know him mostly through George Roy Hill's Slap Shot cultist (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of Coen brothers.
With a final role as sponsor of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.
In contrast to several of the movie legends that left the profession early, Newman will have remained on the loose for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its fasts and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, "as a living challenge to "subplaying" judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles fell all cooked long in the beak.
However, he less often played the first youths than the margins: nevros, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown facets of his true pudic sensitivity.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine portrait of female melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
His great friend and former partner Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sad: "His presence has made my life better and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrating features of the missing actor.
Beyond his career as a legend, there is also a great activist for civic rights, ecology, independent cinema, a challenger of Hollywood drifts.
We'll have seen a lot of his benet trolling on pots of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of enough taste, although gag initially.
However, the profits of these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, has been committed to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Citizen model, in sum and above.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company make in their invoice factory?
Next, on 8 October, hearings on the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of embezzlement, in the form of criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, which has caused particularly serious damage and other charges have been brought against them, such as for example, false and false.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and the municipalities, in total about 65 million HUF, went on the one hand in the caisses of the Fiatal Balloldal movement and on the other hand in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to receive money from the subsidies obtained by issuing invoices of fees, behind which no actual benefits were provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained bill books in the Józsefváros market, while making the caches in Kiskunhalas.
For the company names that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in northern Balaton Lake province, carried out by István Lados, at János Zuschlag's request.
According to the testimony of the latter, he had to identify pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they realized the other invoices they would introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as to the Municipality of Capital for access to grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and by his accomplice András  wateri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with writing the files necessary to obtain the subsidies.
During a "detection circuit", one of the choices of Lados was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this site restored a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for as many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up on behalf of the Jobb Jövőert Foundation, which will subsequently be named Együtt a Harmadik Evezredert, was a failure of form and substance.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three bedrooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
The issuers of invoices to the overflowing imagination also fell into excess when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither the name of Jobb Jövőért nor the name of the Hoppá appeared, according to the information given to the public prosecutor.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told the hvg.hu site that when the prosecutor called him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that these were false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He added: "In addition to the form, the fact that, according to the invoice, one hundred people have lived there, neither does it glue, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which have so much room.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
Nor did the issuers of zele invoices find out about the travel agencies in Budapest, which are part of their choice, but only organizing trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be settled in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
Moreover, as appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while the travel services, the destination of which is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up on behalf of the Hotel Revfölöp to the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's services do not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. Furthermore, the hotel's employees only issue printed invoices, while the false were written by hand.
The Public Prosecutor's investigation revealed that "issuers" also made errors by mentioning as a service the transport of goods by road, that the issuing company could not exercise the invoices, since its profile was the investment advice.
In addition, the invoices issued in the order of Együtt a Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyezület and Biztos Pont proved false, for defects in form, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps.
Just as in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehertó, which both deny to be the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The falsifiers also did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., located in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal at their home. According to our information, this is why the company's liquidator did not issue this invoice.
deliberately established invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has drawn up an invoice to the order of the foundation Együtt a Harmadik Evezredert, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the order of the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of about 5 million HUF, but behind which no benefits were actually provided.
Neither did any financial movement take place, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies avoided mentioning it in their accounts.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly linked to the accused.
For example, the managing director of Delta Trió Kft., managing the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipment was allegedly purchased by the cash investment company Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a Romanian man of origin, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of the Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt companies in Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány, and that he took their countervalue.
It is precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, which is explained by the accused's lack of work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the company's founding acts, he made invoices to their names, to the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov has provided agencies with a total of 15 invoices issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The public prosecutor thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices and VAT went into the Kubatov pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictional invoices which were used as part of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetseg a Modern Magyarszágért filed an application for a subsidy with the public utility organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this grant for an amount of twice 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this being known, five fictional invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will refer to the method of making the invoices, as they had already done before the prosecutor's office.
What could be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the least detail, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his best interest, or perhaps in that case, the socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would carry the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably vex, as applications for his residence under surveillance, on the basis of a relief of his detention conditions, constantly fall into the ear of a deaf one.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of unreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, await the end of the procedure at their own home. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of the auction: why do we spend more money?
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and overestimate the commodity.
New York University's neurology and economics researchers have been able to update the neurological and economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in Science magazine, human beings do not want to be dissociated during this type of competition, such as auctioning on eBay, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
These researches have attempted to create a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" by means of sales at experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played the loto, while the other group took part in a fun auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (IRMf) process, researchers analyzed the active brain domains of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction of which an essential element is the over-sell of a third party, the whole under the brain trunk, called striatum, was moving intensively when the part was lost.
This part of the brain, in addition to several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial oversight analyses.
In these cases, three groups were overburdening a partner in various circumstances.
They simply informed the group about the actual value of the product in question, and they did so.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15, in reward.
While the third group received the $15 prior to the auction, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is, in fact, that the emphasis was on victory, while the emphasis was on failure.
By proving the hypothesis of the neurologists, the players' team "against the failure" were prepared for higher bets than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any economic theory that already exists.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena observed at auctions only by the pleasure of winning and setting it at risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by leading, now, to a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated that one hundred miles of patients carrying the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles follow a treatment. This is because often the patients do not know that they are carrying the virus.
The hepatitis name is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and the diseases caused differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogen genes, are mainly spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. food or water contaminated), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses by blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, vaccination against viruses A and B is recommended anyway. There is no C vaccine.
Hepatitis A symptoms occur two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, generally accompanied by general poor condition, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then there is a visible yellowish on the skin and on the white of the eye, the legs become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Every year around the world, one million people die from the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know about the virus, because the pathogenic gene will gently destroy the liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as is regular testing.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently there are 200 million patients with C-type chronic hepatitis worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of contamination disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30th is the World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis caused by viruses, the causes of its development, and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does one who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph has published an article that researchers from the University of Oxford have carried out an interesting experience by analysing how much faith in God could influence tolerance to the pain of the human being.
As part of this least strange experience, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electrochocs, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it has also been discovered that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences in which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experiment takes place in the following way: an instrument that sparks sparks and spreads the electrochocs is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look steadily at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady at the Hermine painted by Léonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary would evoke a sort of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, was about its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, 20 electrochocs were received in four parts succeeding, while looking either at the painting with religious theme or the painting with more general theme.
The Catholics said that, in the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe," like someone who is "careed" and they "rested, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious theme, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonard's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that one can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in the atheists, provided that one finds the right photo.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican Bishop, praised the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change and, in many cases, actually change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, it is only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if one shows the believers a Madonna painted by Léonard or by a painter of the same size?
Would the view of a better quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You are what you reveal about you
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found at the bottom of the people's pocket as well as the sky above their head. He knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and which are their centers of interest.
Yet it is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, that is one of the influential people of society.
While the skeptics that parallel Orwell's horror vision do not see the essentials of the 2.0 web, they do not.
Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times a little while ago that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can meet their initial goal, which sounded as follows: "Let's collect in a system all the information of the world!".
According to Google's leader, after ten years of a world-wide struggle, they are always only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
To the question: what will there be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer such questions as "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the job that would do me best?". However, the software will not be able to answer such a question, simply at first sight, that the day they will know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear for all Internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search, and the pages then consulted by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and consult what they have been looking for, on what they have clicked. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to provide a much more personalized response, and will submit us products and services based on our previous declarations and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my work is? Ask users, who are worried about Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can provoke fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or possibly revolt against power that can provoke a counter-reaction among Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases they are passed on to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of the Internet users.
The most striking example of recent years is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information he had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing an identification.
The human rights-sensitive Internet users were able to push a relief sigh last May, when Google, with the EFF electronic legal protection agency below, proved its right right to court before the FBI. According to the judgement handed down in the future, Google may still not be obliged by any of the constitutional points to disclose information on the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won over the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years earlier. However, it ultimately fails to obtain lists of searches of private users, nor the full list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is fraught with those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that we manifest against the proud multinational societies of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its "sauvageons" bringing together the enthusiasts, activists and users of the computer who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of large companies, the "connected corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, even though both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its ID users, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and package of programs, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, against the practice of the official giant of the software.
The reason may also be that geeks see the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what the web 2.0, the most proclaimed key word in recent years, is right behind it.
Indeed, Web 2.0 does not concern anything but collaboration, that the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use communication channels at our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential thing remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A youth, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and it can even link them to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, it can link them to a prosecution system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These youth can also hold blogs, in which their most recent photo galleries appear automatically on Flickr or Picasa.
While you can see many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands the pictures of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his infidel friend spent the evening, or that of the company that laid off one of his employees, only for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, you can be on one thing: the term privacy is totally to reconsider today.
The one who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and that is how the principle behind the behaviour of today's young people can be defined.
He wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, can do so (beginning, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. Google's services, through the processing of text to image processing, to reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge servers and which do not assemble our best profile, having existed to date.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding itself, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM (140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola (110 billion).AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten advertising agencies' turnover, while benefits introduced at an increasing rate cause serious migraines not only in Microsoft, but in many other computer program creators.
However, critical observers find, alongside all of this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the company's top management has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it doubled the price of the company's kindergarten and after the company considered it too expensive the daily multiple restoration, taken at any time. All of this seems derisory beside the fact that already in 2006, Google acquired before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are not announced only when they can be used. What's on is that in the next few months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's project to scan and archive books and magazines takes so important dimensions that the company will soon be faced with the Supreme Court of the United States, others are shaking in front of its health system, because in it we can build a complete medical benefit from our previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction writers. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-tons of Orwellians, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a fearsome way only through Google data.
Two minors helped to remove the traces of the double homicide of Ózd
"The police called two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double homicide of Ózd. According to substantiated suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the department police department of Borsod.
The young people have recognized the facts that are blamed for them, and they are accused of complicity for the moment.
The two minors, who, according to the information provided by MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency), are young girls, defend themselves freely.
The complicity of murder can lead to a detention period of up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ózd, a 23-year-old young man, was placed in pretrial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it became apparent that the 23-year-old man was owed a large amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt, and it is for this reason that he attracted his creditor last Wednesday to a site of Ózd where he killed him, as well as that man's young girl, who was nine years old.
According to the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden at the scene of the crime is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange proposes the acquisition of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed EUR 2100 million, some SEK 5 billion, for the purchase of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange's share package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the President of the Warsaw Securities Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish have made despite the fact that, in the past, the Czechs have excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months' time.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the least good owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be between SEK 5 billion and SEK 10 billion by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the paper would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, with approximately 25 percent of holdings, followed by the 14.7% of the Ceská Sporitelna Bank and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from a European press point of view
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, increasing from day to day, the leading newspapers of the European press are already referring to a "second 11 September".
"The global financial disaster owes it to the American President" - accuses Rome's daily life, La Repubblica. "The President was not even able to block his own party behind a bill, improvised to the west, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire Warren Buffett referred to, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo's daily vision, the political leadership's shortcomings led the world economy to collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is growing every day, and the whole world is going to pay for it.
Bush's plan was far from being perfect, however, on the basis of the Congress vote, a real danger, the one Washington is not proposing a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the vacuum, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations is taking place in the history of capitalism.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer - stresses the Geneva Day Indicator.
Some states can still send a life-suck to their qualifying financial agencies, and with the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks grow up like dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union to do little about their national selfishness, and to centralise control over the divided financial markets.
Only Monday's weakened financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the daily daily newspaper Der Standard in Vienna, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands on the pockets, very deeply, in a way similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent on its own.
The "saviors" should not burn a hundred billion euros right away, on the other hand, it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the bourdon
What better method would be used to develop suitable technologies to avoid an obstacle, unless it is the imitation of an existing obstacle detector already in nature?
For example, that of bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, which takes place in Japan, the bees gave the strategic idea of starting with the engineers at Nissan, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robotic car, a bio-inspired self-robotized system of BR23C type, which he has equipped with bees qualities, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During his flights, each bee forms its own oval-shaped space, which in reality resembles our secure protective shell - explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the department of research and development and the brand's public technological relations.
The face-to-face bee eye plays a vital role, as it is capable of seeing in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the face-to-face eye, the engineers addressed the idea of laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance manoeuvre immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movement of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from a sufficient angle to avoid the collision.
Contrary to any current system, this avoidance manoeuvre takes place entirely instinctively.
"If this was not the case, the mini auto robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratoire Mobility and robotized car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the protective envelope, a layer where the collision is currently considered inevitable.
All this process must reflect what bees do to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference can not go up, down or in diagonal, it can be only two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid the other bees, in our case, only the rotating movement, acceleration and slowing as manoeuvres available to the mini auto robot could be used.
BR23C uses lighter, lighter lithium-polymer batteries with a higher energy concentration, making their life span longer than in the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only address and respond to a few incoming signals per second.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on the data of the previous manoeuvres. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don't need memory of a giga-byte capacity, or even mega-byte capacity.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology for instant avoidance. Nissan estimates that this system will enter series-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, intended to buy suspicious bank credits, and to be used several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that in the course of further discussions lasting until after midnight, Saturday, the local time of the east coast, the leaders of Congress agreed on the controversy that has existed for days and days around the rescue plan totalling $700 billion.
"We have made a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the American Chamber of Representatives' Democratic President, who said that it is only left to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The U.S. Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, commented by commenting on the compromise that the program will work and be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a question here of saving Wall Street, but rather of turning the economy around in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8 p.m., Washington local time (i.e. Monday morning at 2 p.m., according to the local time of Central Europe), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock exchanges.
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill on behalf of the emergency economic stabilization law of 2008. Then it will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress made this night, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy" - said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House.
Furthermore, the diverging programme of the Bush administration's initial proposal, which mentioned that the $700 billion needed to be spent at one time, was to be used for the buy-back of suspicious credit securities.
From now on, a maximum of half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury to buy suspicious bank receivables, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congress decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase suspicious receivables, suspicious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" receivables.
Competent persons in the department stated that buy-backs may take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees the tools that cause concern, for which companies have paid a premium equivalent to foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to provide $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it involves the extensive redemption of suspicious debts, their insurance, or the risk of seeing the system collapse from one major financial institution or another.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to apply the law as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders in bad positions and waiting for state aid can expect their retirement benefits, simply called gold parachute overseas, to be capped by the government.
The cap on wages is only mentioned in specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat proposes its support to the company.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury secretariat buys out as part of an auction, they will collect an extra tax on the gold parachute, unless the discretionary bank president retires.
Immediately after the acquisition of suspicious receivables, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to leaders is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it is nevertheless necessary to add that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling only concerns new contracts, this in order to motivate participation in the plan.
It is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force for the appointments of directors general - commented the chairman of the committee responsible for the financial benefits of the House of Deputies, the Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can even be a winner in the business as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks fall back on their feet.
The bill mentions that within the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to Congress on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were of course those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
This is not why American citizens have mandated us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of Parliament of California, Darrell Issa.
Mary Kaptur, her Democrat colleague in Ohio, believes it is the same thing to press for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the manufacturing sector of products and chemicals (1.6 per cent).
The result was a deflation in the oil processing (1.4 per cent), machinery and electrical equipment manufacturing (0.9 per cent), and a minimal increase in wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
The other industries in the processing industry experienced an increase of 0.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent.
In the sectors of supply of electricity, gas, steam and water, representing a significant weight in the national industrial operation, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the price of gas introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account domestic sales of the processing sectors, the prices of the oil processing sector have experienced the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the metallurgy sector, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important food, beverage and tobacco sector, prices increased by 11 per cent.

Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa exemption agreement will enter into force by 12 January. That is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now everything will depend only on the time when the overseas electronic systems of entry and control will be put into service".
However, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be negotiating from today, in Washington.
He will meet the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will give the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
Sunday, Barack Obama as well as John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, secured their support for the government's $700 billion rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary to the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, Congress and Administration finally announced, on Sunday at dawn, that they had reached agreement in principle on the bank rescue plan.
This financing plan, which aims to ease the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain, each and every one more fit to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, with the release of economic issues, Obama again managed to get a little bit ahead. McCain's advance, obtained with Sarah Palin's appointment as a colossal just after the Republican Convention, has melted.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed its hope to see Congress rapidly vote the life plan law of 700 billion.
He stressed that the proposal contained the consumer protection passages that he also supported.
"Now we have to act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain's economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with the ABC channel, McCain said, "We will all find it difficult to do it (...) but doing nothing is not a possible way."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal mentions the creation of a Treasury Board and the ceiling on the retirement benefits of senior managers, and that he was personally very committed to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill by Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more conscious - this is how the Der Spiegel, the CSU's low score in the Bavarian country, refers to.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
The mirror (mirror.de)
In the online edition of the German left-wing information magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of CSU's dramatic defeat in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this well-known politician, the erosion of the CSU began well before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took up his duties.
The Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs.
This change of era is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to have been completed just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party was completed.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU picked up 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, at the time of Stoiber.
The case may be imputed to the "preferential" modernization in the region established by the CSU.
It has been 40 years since sociologists announced this, but they have been very wrong about the rhythm. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans from North and East in the Bavaria region, in full development, could not remain without consequence on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that, in recent weeks, it has been precisely the groups of classic citizens who have been rather far away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, artisans, bacians and graduates of higher education.
In these groups, support for the CSU fell below 40 per cent.
The press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who ? With whom ? The party presidents stand on the reservation to the questions of the coalition", the Conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the ÖVP Conservatives.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from getting involved in its internal affairs.
The populist party BZÖ is open for negotiations. Greens do not want to agree on the coalition yet.
The elections have taken place, now all around the coalition; during debates on public television, party leaders have barely allowed to see their cards.
Werner Faymann, SPÖ president, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that the collaboration of the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open from Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is beyond question.
Molterer carefully responded to the red proposals.
As he has already said, a collaboration will certainly be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the election of the opposition or the entry into the coalition is for the moment a completely open question, and these points must be discussed in the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, the President of the BZÖ, was once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities" - said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, has begun as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary, as one of the main spokesmen of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, European People's Party Member of the European Parliament, drew attention to the segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects Roma children the most, and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Mr Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Mr Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People's Party Group, Járóka warned that apart from the distinctions found during the hires, the Roma disappeared from the labour market, first of all, as a result of their low qualifications.
"A overwhelming majority of Roma young people do not have high school degrees, and as a result of poor basic education, only a small part has the opportunity to get a higher education diploma."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in promoting other fundamental rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economy of EU Member States.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
The sooner a Roma child starts school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market, and the taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"By virtue of their nationality from the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low quality and sectarian education." - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the Member of Parliament, cooperation by the European Union towards an objective and action is needed to speed up the process of de-gregation of schools immediately and to this end respect for the existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, the opportunities offered by democracy must be given to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens with full rights in the future of Europe" - Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the objective of the Summit on Equal Opportunities in Europe, held each year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: grace for a transition period
The decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken in October
Despite this pitiful election failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been adjourned.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. Is the question of how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, which has suffered a catastrophic vote loss of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the extraordinary party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
In any case, members of this highly criticized pair felt that they did not hold their seats specifically.
Thanks to this, they used to calm the furious members of the fraction and base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - that is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the only sovereign of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives always have a strong position in this southern region, of key importance to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced on the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal redevelopment of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates discussions with the Liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Libres Electors, who are formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange nose foot of fate was that with the help of the list of Libres Electors, entering into the legislation Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stroiber has served as an opportunity to push through by the duo Huber-Beckstein, and then to treat the very ambitious municipal political woman without any effort.
Now the CSU's leaders are putting all their energy to stabilize, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far pulled the strings in the back, will also receive an active role. On September 28, the former head of regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed the most bitter day of his political career.
Monday, Huber launched a few bitter remarks towards the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be lucky again if they restore one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of ground of the CSU will not adversely affect the grand coalition of Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democrats always lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivals : 110 - 0
No member of the opposition has joined the Belarusian parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which provides him with prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the illegalities committed during the polls.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognise the elections.
Although the law of 110 people in this country of 10 million people has been very much opposed for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Nations Democratic Forces (ODSZ) had seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate as President for the fourth time in questionable elections, on the traces of the change of the constitution in 2006, would "permit" this time the presence of some members of the opposition in parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ abandoned its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where, because of the Belarusian political order which is described as an anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry visas, was one of the opposition's expectations. Belarus had to take credit because of the decline in imports of Russian natural gas, which is becoming more expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines across the country, passed into the hands of Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the ban on the nomination of a third of the opposition candidates, referred to a pre-retirement.
However, the Monday OSCE press release already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when voting was being held.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize the South Ossetia and the separate Abazia from Georgia. However, Russia with whom Belarus forms a paper confederation, has been considering the two independent territories for a month already.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU" - said Alexandre Milinkevich to our newspaper.
According to the 2006 presidential election opposition candidate, it is desirable that this remain so, despite the fact that "the power was afraid of this Parliament, which has no weight, to bring in even one opponent".
The opposition does not provide for actions of protest in the light of the results; rather, it tries to convey its message about the need for economic reform among voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concern about this side: we have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, local authorities put sticks in the wheels for dissemination, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly" - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported pensioners does not consider it to be really appropriate.
"Because of the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'revoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time" - Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Serguei Lebedev, in charge of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." In this way, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never before, in the history of the Chigi Palace, no aircraft had rotating doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from today on, this new measure is in effect against the little villains, against whom points and then drinks the coffee at the bar during the hours of work.
The anti-fainting novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The turning doors--telling Brunetta--are an instrument for better working, with more productivity, more presences and more services," the Minister said.
Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
"It's reformism" also stresses Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No employee resistance was recorded, the Secretary-General assures us: "it is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all".
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or croissant.
Promised by Brunetta, who suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
"In three months' time, public employees' absences of illness were reduced by 50%, or 60 million more workers in one year."
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "of which wage dynamics- explains the Minister- over the past 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and much more than inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined forces to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Order using the Codacons.
"But the Minister of Public Function today spreads data on the decline of absenteeism in the workplace due to written illness-the association of consumers-the people of "active pests" continues to increase.
In fact, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive Public Administration employees gathered to declare war against the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, there is a challenge to the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity for service; the extension of the schedules of permanent residential hours of the sick worker, during which checks are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Each day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirmed that white deaths were around 1,200.
Figures that demonstrate the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, the social forces and the media to this dramatic aspect, Anmil is celebrating today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Accident Victims on Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data transmitted by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention at the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the continuing associative effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and the raising of public awareness.
"Of course indignant, everyone has hit a hand to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, arouse the call of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are particularly important for a more direct awareness of young people entering the labour market.
It is our duty, to keep our attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm on social gravity, to implement and improve legislative standards.
For its part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us and requires all the institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data from accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths being still impressive," the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli later stressed.
"We do not wish that this "tendance to discount" actually translates into minor attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes, that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, it is not enough to contrast the occurrence of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"In our view, Mercandelli has emphasized that more controls and inspections are needed, as is a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this from school."
- He added: "We need to make another effort with regard to communication and awareness-raising of public opinion.
"But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for the protection of the compensation provided for victims of work" and "the drift of assistance towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance – he added – so that the fate of the person who has an accident should not depend on the spontaneousity or the enlargement of the legislature"
Mp3 player pointed to the finger, they put hearing at risk.
Listening to full volume music for a prolonged period of time using portable musical instruments such as Mp3 players can cause permanent damage to the hearing.
This is what the European Commission has announced, which, in a communiqué published in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the recently identified and unforeseen health risks (Csrseri) of the EU published today.
"of this scientific report-read us in the note- it turns out that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full volume music using portable musical instruments, for more than one hour per day and per week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data - pursues the responsible Ue- it is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies"
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"The scientists-concluded executive confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents against noise exposure from portable and similar musical instruments.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100Db, but concern is increasing about hearing damage that might result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to effectively limit these data using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices, who listen to music in full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those listening to music under such conditions for prolonged periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to about 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Alemanno has ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we end, in June we will pull the money.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning, at the new seat, behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission components will be drawing up the directives for Rome.
In March when they have finished, the Committee and the Community Council will evaluate the analyses and projects so as to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitole and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it- it would like to stress Alemanno- it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which can be used by political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Community Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, she will have finished her duties and will then disappear, as this experience must have a precise temporal duration.
In June-announced the Mayor- we will present the strategic plan derived from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied:" Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overshadowed by the day-to-day and emergency management that manifests itself from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look forward, and further on, to a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome would like to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or bureaucratic body: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman cities, and will be used to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "a draft strategic reference is needed, neither firm nor immobile, in order to enable our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit," .
A future which, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but will look further" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A famous American politician who wants to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who apart from his decisions destroyed the US economy and had reports (as he always has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks against Obama are increasing as election time approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is really clumsy: he believes he will win the highest function of a nation that counts in total, two governors and five black senators!"
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; these are, of course, racial attacks, and do not answer the question of all voters: will it be a good chairman? We also have the polls, which all declare that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it's still someone who talks to the heart, not the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the southern US wrote an article: once in the ballot box, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
This is how an aspect of American mentality emerges, kept secret until the end.
"Whatever you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross, on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Never be revealed so far, to the point that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 per cent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was returned to her home by foot to the buttocks.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives, and Americans have not been forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq has been, for the most part, Bush's weakness.
Who will take George W's place will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even by journalists: in the press, it's the hour of deletions. And many accuse the Internet, this "killing" of newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are today pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly state to the information officers, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the deletions in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on the assembly of newspapers, are a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the general public hears it is wanted to be reduced accordingly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a bad path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web goes.
The largest publishing houses were moving to the Internet, perceived by many as the "killer" of the newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to putting on the technology hoping that she "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest accent in American journalism lies among those who run the newsrooms – the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level this percentage is down to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "work safety".
Directors who think they're losing their job in 3 years' space are 47% at the national level.
With regard to journalists, we are going to 30%.
The one of the "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on contract.
In an immense nation like the Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a question to take or leave.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 thousand a month, in addition to retirement and payment of insurance.
As for holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, have passed a number of years.
But according to their revelations, American journalists are often "bad" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTEE A GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the agency of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had requested permission to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for road banking in the context of the Unipol-Bnl climbing instruction.
During the trial, last week, he had obtained the home release transformed into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent be able to travel through the city to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which the PM did not grant) would allow it to influence its society and to have access to the evidence that accuses it.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the rescue plan of $700 billion approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times yesterday that confirms it to us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared between its cautious East Coast soul, favouring federal institutions as well as the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the Washingtons" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the central and southern states.
The soul, precisely, which was made to feel despotic with the vote I was talking to you about at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just an example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake is predicting or is already making: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and can be not only here.
In the United States as well as in Europe, the crisis seems to have accelerated the phenomena that have been covered in recent times, to the point that, in the new climate, they are solidifying and manifesting themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updating, extraordinary revival, of the dual category of sovereign state, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with foreign countries, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for whom it is governed: that is to say, to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically, it is almost national.
Political internationalisation does not seem to be at stake, nor does it have much to say: the obvious proof is provided by the European Union, which, as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, fails to decide any common policy line.
And so, it is the government of each state that everyone is waiting for intervention, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a provision of credits: when we go through a difficult period, there is only the States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things in place.
They also have the means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements of which neither a market nor an international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new phase of the state-nation crisis is also in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor that is quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, indeed, when we were convinced that we have now entered the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at once that our future will have to deal more and more with rather less material things such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but are absolutely connected to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more maps than he who is not, that is, he who has the evil chance of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now arrive at the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably said Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis appears to produce two convergent phenomena.
On one side, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take control of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discretion for existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadows.
And moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inappropriateness, a sense of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus even more the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far to their apogee, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have at the same time, and to be always more alien to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, fuelled in an underground way, a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised "revolts" of elections or indeed, in the changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative ascent in Bavaria Austria, to the fall of the workers in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressists against Bush (and it might well be that the right in Italy did not happen by chance).
It seems that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say someone, have more and more difficulty, which does not date from today, to understand and thus to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and agitates potentially disproportionately.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, seems frankly exaggerated.
But it's said well, keep your eyes wide open, it's not without reason.
Supercollege to walk on the walls.
Conquer the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded in this.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to keep a body of 100 kilograms glued on a vertical wall.
The ETUDE- American Science magazine has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti." Explain Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired themselves from the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that allow to ensure the animal, a perfect adhesion.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "is easily detached from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
MARCHER ON MURS? –" this material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Could be to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are drivers of heat and electric current.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering.
For now, no super heroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article from the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented a microfibre-like adhesive that self-cleans dust during movement on an area to ensure a perfect and constant adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juices.
Beware of grapefruit juice, orange and apple.
These beverages, consumed mainly in summer because they are disruptive and rich in vitamins, if associated with some vital drugs, affect the absorption amplifying or decreasing as appropriate, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices being, in box or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: only a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple, to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, cancelling their beneficial effects and risking the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice has already been severely criticized for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antistamulinal and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
Medicines at Risk- It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what one drinks, if one takes medicines such as Diazepam or Méthadone.
NOT THAT THE PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Longue is the list of active principles inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the Public University of Milan, called: "These discoveries are generally reported immediately to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the informative notes of the drugs as needed.
It is always appropriate to read the illustrious papers of the medicines taken, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to be addressed clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert pointed out to the Assa agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of Bush administration's foreign economic and political solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prognosis that took off many polemics, and was accused of the economist for years, but which now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron's collapse or Worldcom's collapse disappeared from the attention of the public," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist" but also a very aggressive publisher, particularly critical of the excesses of the Bush administration's liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity that aims to reach ever more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost one year, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is presented to the general public with various innovations: from the welcome screen, and the interface re-examined and became less austere, to other more important ones, such as compatibility born for the operating system Apple Mac OS X, and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version ISO.
Open Office paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are certain functions specific to certain modules, such as reducing the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF threads into the graphic development module, retaining the original aspect of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that unite the typical Adobe format chart with elements of a calculation sheet or a text editor.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts about changes, in the drafting of texts, because each employee is assigned a color of comment for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is in addition to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available as usual for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be shipped to home or work.
And if the theme of free speech can be a way to spread it in the homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office's suite is trying the big challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Apart from the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also be opened up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the equivalent writing video of Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival presentations of PowerPoint;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the planned figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positiveness at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, third qualified, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At the age of 26, Kohl was the fourth successful cyclist in the third generation Cera, after the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests on Kohl samples are part of the blood tests carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positiveness of the Cera, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will have to predict two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positiveness to the Third Generation Epo, was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, notified the positiveness to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus culminating the pea jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES APPLICATION IF ITALIE IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigration has recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reticence.
Would it turn the Beautiful Country into a nation of racists? That's what the New York Times is about, which dedicated a long article on the subject of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are both those where we register" more integration and more work", but also "an anti-immigrant feeling the strongest in the country and the most important support for the Northern Lega"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new Lega legislation intended to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
Trend emphasized by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market does not know of a crisis
According to the Sunia's latest survey, the tenant's union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects in order to exclude entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin have to support- explains the head of Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong demand from students has distorted the market so much that a general increase process has begun for the residents themselves.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered contracts, without rent limit, sub-rents.
For Sunia, extraordinary intervention through the revision of the tax is necessary to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from a minimum of 650 euros (the Bande Nere zone), to an average of 800 euros (the Lambite zone, the Udine zone, and the Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 euros (the Vittoria zone)
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, 250/280 euros are required for a double bed, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are requested for a single, 450 for a double bed.
Smallly lower values (550 euros for a simple) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can only save money if you travel in peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 euros for a single one in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, expenditure from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vandero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for a bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are in absolute terms lower, but they are of major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rents are often taken by extra-Community students, have a subsequent anomaly: the rent requested to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Good-bye old Paradiso cinema, the cities elect the historic halls.
The historic cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the outskirts of the large multi-rooms, and the death of consummation of the mono-rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seems inextricable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often historical places loaded with memory, "it's as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we have shared a bit of the road and so many emotions," observes the director of Nuovo Paradiso cinema, a film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the juror of Cannes, and which told the poetry of a provincial room, and nostalgia in a way to live the cinema, lost can be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the halls of the main cities that paid mainly for them: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closure, the Emilie Romaine is in the lead with 82 single-room cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-salt cinemas: 195 screens more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exploitation has developed in an irrational way" observed Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those who already exist, because when a room is closed in a city, these visitors are not necessarily all willing to go to the multiplex.
Not to mention the missing debate on credit for traders: the government's past debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame that, from a ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million per year would be needed.
We note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, concerned with these closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, to defend and promote the mono-room cinemas of the historical centres and on the outskirts.
Among the normative measures, there are measures of tax relief for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators can enter the limited traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and in some car parks.
"It's an initiative that pleases me," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna setting up other measures.
It is clear, however, that in contrast to the superpower of multiplex, traditional rooms must also improve the sound and image quality, as today's public is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradiso cinema" which I thought for ten years already.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, I turn from the other side not to see the blackboards through the dust.
Links between politics and “ndrangheta”, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices made by the Mayor to the interests of the Piromodelle clan."
heavy charges are being brought by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiplane, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The manettes also for Gioacchino Piromalla, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his little son, a lawyer, homonym of the boss, already convicted for association of mafia-type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to the legal and moral norms, and above all the common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local authorities had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalla.
"So it would have been granted to the clan -writing the judges- to enter officially within the mayors facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and orientation of the public administration"
The president of the regional committee calabrais Agazio Loeero, does not hide only "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is greater than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressure of the Andrangheta, heroes who are honest"
This morning's arrests follow the arrests of last July, following which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalla clan.
As early as the end of April, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always because of alleged conditioning between organized crime and local government, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the city.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a right centre coalition, after the promulgation of May 2006.
He shouted at the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the council.
He accused the interior deputy minister, Marco Minniti, of having managed the whole thing for a political issue, but in view of the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromodelle clan had even succeeded in requesting the variation of the A3 project.
Based on the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm writes, emerged "the availability to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more known group, near the Piromodelle, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born of waves, now the bigs are starting.
This is an expansive deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the major global energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossians like Chevron have been looking, and now try to put their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmentalists and the new increase in oil give the sector a big boost.
In 2007, the World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by offshore power systems.
This amount would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides.
Colosses under attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy was the Enersis, which signed an agreement in 2005 to build an installation in Northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, a real revolutionary step would have been said.
Two years from this, more and more of these companies have always been dedicated to traditional marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies-- said the spokesman of a company associated with the American oil colossus, the Wall Street Journal, and it evaluates the possibilities for cooperation with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the U.S. Committee on Energy, which is necessary to give rise to a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if we consider that, in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travel through the sea's energy route, and the money invested to date, although their details are not known, according to observers, indicates an increasing interest.
Tecnology to develop.
The experts talk about a technology still in its early stages, on the other hand, that marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
Currently, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create a major problem for the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technologies with a higher environmental impact must be used.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a buoy system linked to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which causes the mud to move up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine which, in turn, feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
For the time being, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, already produces energy for a commercial centre and a car park using six marine turbines from the East River in New York.
The movement of water during the tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced to have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permissions to extract energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electrical Energy, deserves the potential of tides at the moment.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from the wind, from the sun, or from the waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on the energy of tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others, look to the coast, invested $7 million and half of 2008 and forecast investments up to $35 million in 2009.
