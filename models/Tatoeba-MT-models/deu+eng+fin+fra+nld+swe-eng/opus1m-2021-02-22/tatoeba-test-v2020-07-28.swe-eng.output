I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom teaches.
She's done too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never agree.
It is uncertain whether the letter ever came out or not.
We haven't done anything.
You lost your pen.
You're gonna lie in bed all day, aren't you?
That's not how Tom can do it.
Tom crawled under wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really going to do that?
Give this to Tom.

Then try it.
It didn't really affect us.
Did Tom vote?
I'm going like a penguin.
Have I forgotten anything?
You're longer than me.
Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech dragged me out.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do as Tom suggests, unless someone else has a better proposal.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only speak for myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom hit Mary.
You should have liked it.
I've got a few more.
I'm using the computer.
Sex was invited, the boy included.
Kate's cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There is no doubt who will be elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep myself motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read the Saga about the ring trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
She advocated gender equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
Say hello, Guild Brother.

I was just teasing.
Stay down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.

I need an answer.
I hate my computer.
He lost control of the car in the curve.
I hope you find Tom.

We're different.
Come back in the van.
She helped the old man along the way.
Nobody's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom fooled me.
Tom's helping.
One morning, he saw a pretty girl.
This tree is not even close to being the highest in the socks.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up, please leave your essays.
My father's healthy.
We can save a lot of lives.
If you don't have any money, you'll be fine without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Helen's words suddenly filled me with new power.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He'd have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy caught the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of anyone?
I'd like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He's gonna fall for the temptation.
The TV doesn't work.
I can explain that.
She behaves like a child.
How does it look?
Mary thinks she has super powers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but you can at least accept that there are people who have different opinions than you?
Tom put the book down.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't imagine seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I pay for my Internet dependency.
I never thought it would be so hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down in town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it down?
Tom blinked with the whole light.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone says they did.
There's no one here called that.
It's time to go.
All three men lied.
Come sit down.
It's got to be enough.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My chainsaw is broken.
You think she's pretty, what?
He lived a simple life.
This is gonna take years.
I spelled it wrong.
I don't like this book.
An octopus has ten arms.
She didn't show up before two.
I am.
That was very good.
Come and talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
Never would I have seen such a peaceful vision.
Tom's fast.
About 4.9 per cent of Finns are Finnish Swedish, i.e. people with Swedish as their native language.
Unfortunately, Tom sat down.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She attached a photo.
The walls of the old house weren't straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the wheel to the right.
I'm in the attic.
Tom said he doesn't eat meat.

Not really.

I've let the tailor sew a new suit for me.
I thought it was a joke.
Tom and I, we both miss you very much.
Please.
Tell me why she's crying.
It's an old manuscript.
You wouldn't enjoy it.
I'm talking to the principal.

What did they think?
He dried the sweat off his face.
Wash your face.
When I got home, I discovered I had lost my wallet.

Tom must have hit his head.
Tom was cheating on a nurse while he was in the hospital.
How big will it be?
He acted quickly and extinguished the fire.

You have to repay your debts.
It's okay with me.
I'll go to work at 7:00.
I'm happy.
What's so funny?
