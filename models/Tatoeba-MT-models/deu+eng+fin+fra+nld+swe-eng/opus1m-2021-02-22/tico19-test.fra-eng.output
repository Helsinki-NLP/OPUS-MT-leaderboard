Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of Coronavirus disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar development in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming and, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak of patients with VID-19 requiring care, in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a benign condition, i.e., respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of whom heal.
In approximately 14% of the cases, COVID-19 results in a more severe condition requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a serious form of the disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to VID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution experienced by the Hubei province in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the momentum of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is currently following that of that country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that VID-19 is a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 among people from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA and United Kingdom (UK) countries with 39,768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths between 31 December 2019 and that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy only.
Accumulated number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CEPCM), the number of cases of VID-19 reported in each country worldwide, obtained only from official sources such as the ministries of health, the national and regional health authorities of the different countries and the WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare it with Italy's experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country by 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. with the data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
The cumulative 14-day incidence of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of the Hubei province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of VID-19 began to increase around 21 February before experiencing a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This trend was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom reported a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to the data of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
At 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of VID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy indicated that approximately 10% of patients with IOC-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of cases of VID-19 to hospitals and/or in intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (undisclosed data).
However, a systematic collection is needed to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of cases reported and deaths.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100 000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate beds per 100,000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios related to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a risk > 90% of the excess capacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECPCM rapid risk assessment for COVID-19.
Since the cases were so far grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and that hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, data on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing within the EU/EEA and in the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community-based transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of patients with VID-19 requiring care, in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As noted in the recent rapid risk assessment of CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, from a restraint to a mitigation approach, since the rapid and early increase in the number of cases might not allow sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
Rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window in which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Without that, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will have to deal with a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 people in China and around the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
As its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which produced thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissive and affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this growing research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still await answers, we hope that this review will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Festival of Spring, 25 January 2020, has forever marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain closed for the entire duration of the gold week and for long other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV), which caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003; therefore it was baptized SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout China before expanding to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "the public enemy number one", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 work has been published on COVID-19, particularly in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020 presenting the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this new subject.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and will address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common rums 4.
However, over the course of this century we have experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third epidemic of recent history coronavirus.
As presented in Fig. Fig.1.1,1 pneumonia outbreaks of unknown origin were first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission in Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was unveiled.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic had spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health care professionals had been infected, suggesting interhuman transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the town of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO called the global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of writing this report, the disease had already spread to all China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhda).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but more predominantly in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7 per cent) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 had a greater incidence of men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was growing in homes, mainly in the Hubei province and on the outskirts.
The mean time between symptoms occurred and the diagnosis of VID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95 per cent CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincided with the massive displacements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 percent, and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for VID-19 were gender (male), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a simple brin RNA.
They can be classified in four genera, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect humans belonging to alpha and beta genera.
Spike glycoprotein (S) in the envelope is bound to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cellular receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane fusion occurs.
Viral RNA genome is released into cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genome RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98 % genetic identity between 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the epidemic, the seafood market of Huanan in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using electronic transmission microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was identified as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by Orf3b and a secreted protein coded by Orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 Orf3b could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, Orf8 does not contain known areas or functional grounds.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the cryo-ME structure of the complete human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the carrier of amino acids B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original host and intermediate host
It was established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were derived from bats and that they were transmitted to man via civets and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the barrier of species to infect the human remains unknown, and the transmission route is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., suggested that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to man by snakes, which would involve homologous recombinant in the S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers from Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long-meal mammal nourishing ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if assessed by genetic homology at 99% between a found coronavirus in pangolin and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference between two genomes is a significant difference; it is therefore appropriate to expect conclusive results to establish concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and for up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could have very good similar properties.
It appears that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75 %, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally devoid of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by its innate immune system through molecular (PRR) recognition receptors, including Type C lectine receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLR), NOD-type receptors (NLR) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell ripening and type I interferon synthesis (NIF) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of the viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, especially CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Aid T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronavirus may inhibit T cell functions by inducering their apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a restored patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious lung and other organ damage and, in the worst scenario, to a multiviscal failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterised by an outbreak in the household, is more likely to affect elderly people with co-morbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, but more generally 3-7 days from a study conducted in the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average, for a range of 0-24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded a 4.8-day incubation period (3.0-7.2) based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective duration of the quarantine after as precise a period of incubation as possible, in order to avoid that people infected but asymptomatic do not transmit the virus.
People exposed to, or infected with, the virus are usually quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of VID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients have had dyspnea and/ or hypoxaemia one week after the onset of the disease.
Regarding severe cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest radiography abnormalities, should be tested for the virus in order to allow an early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that the patients had a fever of 98%, a dry cough of 76%, a dyspnoea of 55% and a diarrhoea of 3%; 8% of patients required ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies on a family and a home emerging from the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than patients with VID-19, which is consistent with a higher LDN compared to VID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
Regarding SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99 per cent to 100 per cent), dry cough (29 per cent to 75 per cent), dyspnoea (40 per cent to 42 per cent), diarrhoea (20 per cent to 25 per cent) and sore throat (13 per cent to 25 per cent), and ventilatory assistance was required for approximately 14 to 20 per cent of patients.
As of February 14, the mortality rate of VID-19 was 2 per cent, with 66,576 confirmed cases globally.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For the MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37 per cent for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2-4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is far more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it has been for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or in a gathering or a vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often travelled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks before the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals can carry the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks and that restored patients can carry the virus again, which underlines the need to increase the quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a number of white cells < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, and a high rate of aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had high levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the D-dimer rate, a blood fibrin degradation product, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Occurrence of chest X-rays is observed in most patients with VID-19, characterized by uneven bilateral shadows or depolished glass opaqueness at lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumonocytes results in a decrease in hypersensitivity and an increase in superficial tension, reducing the capacity of the lungs to inflate and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapsus.
Therefore, the most worrying chest tests often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumon dequamation, the formation of hyalin membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA and is similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via a polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for the diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for SARS diagnosis.
For example, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang described a protocol for the use of SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which identifies synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive tape in less than one hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens is conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide supportive care to patients with VID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2.2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, restored patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even restored patient plasma was proposed for treatment.
The pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and virus vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 focuses on lungs at first and probably also to a lesser extent on other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threats for patients, and the main cause of death.
This includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporal oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiac derivation technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory failure.
Furthermore, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, and protecting vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
An excessive response of the immune system has been found to cause cytokine shock in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFN the IFN and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multi-visceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, particularly in serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressants for cytokine shocks include modulation of immune response by T cells, blocking of IFN-, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAKs, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 reporting suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, taking high dose steroids did not have any beneficial effects on severe pulmonary lesions in SARS and VID-19 patients.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including avian osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, careful use of short cycles of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses has been recommended in patients with severe COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir has also demonstrated a potential inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including the MERS and SARS.
In view of these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir combination and ribavirin have been developed as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver injury and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Patients restored plasma and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have cured from a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from that disease is an ancestral practice.
Indeed, restored patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize and directly neutralize unique molecules in pathogens.
Plasma was thus extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, combined with reduced inflammation, reduced viral load, and increased blood oxygen saturation.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to be able to propose this method for large-scale use until any specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, it is appropriate to carefully examine some of the disadvantages associated with plasma.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially fatal.
The levels of antibodies in the blood are generally low, and plasma demand for treatment of severely ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes coding the relevant antibodies or to seek effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would allow for a rapid increase in antibody production.
MTC has been used for thousands of years in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis, based on MTC theories.
Most effective components remain little or not at all known as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective treatment for VID-19, MTC is one of the major alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in severe disease remission.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been shown to be effective in the treatment of VID-19.
The best cure rates for VID-19 were observed in Chinese provinces using MTC for 87% of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7%), Ningxia Region (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei Province, which used only 30% of patients with VID-19, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this comparison is rather approximate as many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, need to be taken into account for the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing a treatment using Western medicine (MO) only with a combination of MO and MTC.
It appeared that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to disappear symptoms and the length of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
More impressively, the rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%); similarly, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM remains to be specified through more comprehensive and more central controlled trials.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel very concerned about this highly contagious and fatal disease, and those in quarantine also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early stages of SARS, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, acute confusional state and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact and quarantine research, as part of the response of public health services to the VID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and cause some guilt for the effects of contamination, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
For example, mental health care should be provided to patients with VID-19, individuals identified as likely cases, people in contact with these populations, and any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support must include the training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid any close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the chain of transmission of animals and human beings infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines to produce powerful neutralizing antibodies in the long term and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and on models subject to lethal provocation and their protection from zoonotic virus infection remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and that no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, cases and sporadic outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein sub-units, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the large period (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
To the extent that this is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just starting its clinical development through thousands of patients.
In most cases, the sick gradually recover without consequences.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognosis model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies conducted so far, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with VID-19 are the following (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for SARS prognosis, and this also appears to be the case for VID-19.
The COVID-19 mainly affects individuals between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% over 50 years of age, according to a study conducted in 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have underlying co-morbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for patients with VID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to the positive cholangiocytes of ACE2, which may lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with one another.
Abnormal laboratory results: the C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury; it has been advanced as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between the CRP rate and severity and the prognosis of VID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also participate in prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, including the heart and liver, and are released in the event of tissue injury.
They are therefore traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: the results of chest radiography and the temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in conjunction with other elements for the determination of prognostics and complications of VID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since the high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in severe SARS cases, many survivors experienced avian osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, the administration of steroids to patients with VID-19 should be limited to a low dose and short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has led to a large number of exceptional cases of stress, often with long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty, and death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and regain normal life.
According to demographic studies carried out so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tracts, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tracts and causes no or no symptoms in the first phase of infection, like coronaviruses that cause common colds.
As a result, recently infected or incubated individuals can produce a large amount of viruses during their day-to-day activities, which significantly impedes the control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV was considered to be transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current outbreak of COVID-19 is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than that of SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the containment of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost all the population to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as on other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decline will last from 3-4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., felt that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, would not end up in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the sampling of the mean nasal cornet and the throat of patients recovered 2 weeks after they left the hospital indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to the flu.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the gradual decrease in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to the original forecasts, the Ebola virus was expected to cause up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, thanks to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
As with SARS-CoV, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectivity in order to eventually stop or evolve into a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
A comparison of the VID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough or sneezing, and possibly also by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in cells, revealing a new possibility of fecooral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients revealed that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with prior disease and 40 health professionals.
It is therefore appropriate to take precautionary measures to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even anyone who is likely to be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) is involved in controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces, where they could be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions capable of full penetration; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, as both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to cross five surgical masks stacked on one another, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care professionals need to wear adjusted insulation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor turned out to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have penetrated its organism by eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, health care professionals must also wear transparent visors or protective glasses to contact patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash hands with soap that disinfects more often than usual, to stay contained as much as possible and to limit contact with potentially infected persons.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of one meter with the sick.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new human virus, its high level of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in high warning state after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population by claiming that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited interhuman transmission and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a remarkable release, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies need to learn from them and take the necessary measures.
For example, these agencies (1) need to be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and may affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) show greater sensitivity and responsiveness to unusual clinical data rather than wait for formal reports from physicians or official bodies; (3) show more restrictiveness in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginnings rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) carry out more targeted and relevant exercises to raise awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to test and improve the society's response system on a regular basis.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of drafting this report, it has spread to the whole of China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also similar to those of SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic is seen as a pre-existing impression.
However, there are significant differences between VID-19 and SARS, which should be considered in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
The COVID-19 affects older persons more than young people and men more than women; the severity and mortality rate is also greater among older people.
SARS has more mortality than VID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44%).
Transmission of the virus from VID-19 is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by patients with severe illness; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the spread of VID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 has spread much faster and much more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection tests may be negative for some patients with VID-19.
On the other hand, restored patients may be positive for the virus again.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid progress in research on VID-19, several critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to establish with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from chiroptes.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the initial host virus, e.g. bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt transmission, and the epidemic may resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how does the virus penetrate exactly into the cells of the respiratory tract, and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically developing during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like flu?
It is essential, even if it can take time, to get answers to all these questions as well as many others.
However, regardless of the expenditure that this entails, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only few immunocompromised patients have experienced severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
Apart from the super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could produce approximately two secondary cases with a period of incubation between 4 and 7 days, the peak viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false tests of hepatic function and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in cases of SARS suspicion.
Frequent alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation and macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tracts, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, the liver and the kidney, may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which may be fatal in particular in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a child aged 7 months in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolite is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sampling of an 8-month-old pneumoniad boy in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present throughout the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called a croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a man who was 71 years hospitalized due to pneumonia and broncholiitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of the MERS are similar to those of SARS and characterized by acute, evolutionary pneumonia.
Contrary to SARS, many patients suffering from MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS in relation to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high death rate, or 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most fatal human viruses.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the remaining six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of VID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in cell samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and long-term distribution after transmission to humans, will have an influence on the ultimate fate of the current epidemic of COVID-19.
The four community HCoVs causing moderate symptoms have been well adapted to man.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient proportion to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for the restriction factors of the host.
With this in mind, the greater the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 disease and the greater the number of people infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by about 40 or other control measures for infections.
For many years, the four covs acquired in the community have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, have not been well adapted to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain themselves and spread in their zoonotic tanks and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate and amplifier hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and to the four community HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-based HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-Cov.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among them without an animal host reservoir or intermediate.
Before discussing the animal origins of the HCoV, we will be well advised to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolving, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of the HCoV.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of an HCoV if it is home to a near ascending that shares high homology in the nucleotide sequence.
The original virus has often adapted well and is not pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a reservoir host houses the HCoV in a continuous and long-term manner.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, given that 80% of the Guangzhou market animals have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals can also serve as amplifying intermediate hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies laid the foundations for a new concept that bats host emerging human pathogens.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that the WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate host of SARS-CoV.
Therefore bats cannot be the intermediate host of the MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that the dromadaires are seropositive to the specific antibodies neutralizing the MERS-CoV, as are camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only by respiratory means, but also by fecal means, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even smaller than that which separates beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in beta-CoV evolution.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could both be derived from bat CoV, whereas the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of HCoV-229E inter-species transmission is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of bats near HCoV-229E were found.
First of all, unlike the alpagas, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with the alpagas.
Then the alpha-CoV of bats related to HCoV-229E are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpha-CoV of the alpaga has caused a respiratory disease epidemic in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga was not found in wild animals.
In reality bats are the direct source of human pathogen viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to man.
Another possibility, while bat alpha-CoVs serve as HCoV-229E genetic reservoirs, alpagas and dromadaires could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromadaires and from dromadaires to man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV found in bats is known thanks to its initial identification and has also been enhanced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromadaires for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels that have passed from intermediate host to stable natural host reservoirs.
Contrary to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several inter-species transmission possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 of animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats via removal or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the removal and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have taken place in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research on animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is under way.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated VOC mutation rates could be considered to be "moderate" at "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per site per year, depending on the adaptation phase of the VOC to new hosts.
Nevertheless, VOC transfer rates are about one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the rate of change is often high when the CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the change rate for SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It can be assumed that he has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to the dromadaires.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, VOCs randomly and frequently change models during NRA replication through a unique "copy-copying" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for animal covs such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction associated with transmission
Beyond these three viral factors indicated above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
Recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive evidence of selection during inter-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in adapting the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein means that the association affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, an electronic cryomicroscopy study indicates a 10-20-fold greater affinity of this link than that observed between the human ACE2 and the S protein SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptide N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylic acid for HCoV-OC43.
The difference in host proteins between humans and HCoV natural reservoirs, such as bats, dromadaries and rodents, could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergence of new HCoV: return to check-out
The diversity of bat covs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat covs are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among SARS-CoV secondary proteins, the ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, since bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated but coded divergent ORF8 proteins.
This removal splits the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is urgent as an adaptive change that promotes host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced recombination episodes between different lines, which have occurred in dromadaries in Saudi Arabia.
While ORF4 could be seen in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a delay in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their host reservoirs.
Asymptomatic or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with covs, indicating a mutual adaptation between covs and bats.
It seemed that bats had adapted well to the cov from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by covs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both remove the replication of CoV and affect the "rereading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and lead to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
It is here that the secrets of asymptomatic carrier observation and the cause of cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy to dissociate immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment with SARS-CoV-2.
For example, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 in bats is failing.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a beta-CoV of bat sharing 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Beta-CoVs of the pangolin significantly similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that the pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that the pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CoVs returned under the fire of the ramp due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromadary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as has been done in the wild animals markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic covs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat covs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity to contagion.
Continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of covs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses tanks.
First, if bats transmit a parent virus from SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans come into contact with bats should be determined.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Whether a bat, pangolin or other mammal should be identified, SARS-CoV-2 or the near-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. the mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause diseases) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause diseases.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and the reduction in the infant mortality rate during home delivery.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as hand washing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the major IRAs, is the first cause of death in children under five years of age, which causes nearly 1.8 million deaths a year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia lead to the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor harmful effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing a skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to hand-level eczema or dermatitis, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
Deparasite twice a year, associated with daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and to increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic substances of the soil, are hardly soluble in the water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of antiseptics or recommended disinfectants can target organisms that are resistant to antibiotics in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as predicted.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) that regulate pH, benzoic acid, having antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon Public Health School indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as the carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a humidant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the assuring effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRRAs and ERVs), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectants for hands or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to wet well or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace hand washing unless you have no water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The alcohol-absorbing effect may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients produced significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydroalcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic substances present in the hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, disinfectants for the hands are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for non-alcoholic hands depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas that use benzolkonium chloride have shown sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after administration, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease instead of inhibiting it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make any difference).
Put a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubming one against the other, not forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap eliminates the germs of the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frozen for at least 20 seconds.
The action to rub creates friction, which helps eliminate the germs of the skin, and rub longer remove more germs.
Rinse abundantly with running water.
rinsing in a stagnant watershed may lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and wet hands recover more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and underneath the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can accommodate microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available, such as pouring water from a can or cane that is suspended and pierced and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are alternatives to saving water, such as "tippy-steps" and other economic options.
A tippy tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended crucible using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is discussed.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric dryers often found in toilets.
After hand washing and drying in hot air, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194 per cent on the finger pulp and 25 per cent on the palms.
Drying of the air-jet air-jet resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After hand drying, the following variations in the bacterial count were observed:
There are many different dryer manufacturers, and the dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
hand washing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
The medical hand washing must last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to grind and rub each part of the hands.
Hands must be rubbed against each other, passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The goal of hand washing in health structures is to remove and prevent pathogens ("germs").
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When flushing, water on the forearms should be avoided from falling to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after dealing with a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20 per cent of the wash, and that very few additional benefits were available to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35 per cent.
Further research is needed to identify the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be due to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the campaigns to promote the hygiene of hands that are being carried out in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Hand Wash Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that claims to promote behavioural change.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of a hand wash emoji.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetid smells called miasmes.
For example, in Germany posters depicting "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.

Because it's the flu season
It should also be stressed that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in virus genomes, which are most likely to result from the pressures of selection, particularly through the host immune system.
For example, the loss of complete ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain is due to two nucleotides.
While ORF4 could be seen in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a delay in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their host reservoirs.
Asymptomatic or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with covs, indicating a mutual adaptation between covs and bats.
It seemed that bats had adapted well to the cov from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by covs.
In addition, the activity of natural killing cells in bats is eliminated by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting the natural killing cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low level of expression of the molecules of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DROs) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both remove the replication of CoV and affect the "rereading" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and lead to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged over the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
It is here that the secrets of asymptomatic carrier observation and the cause of cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of the CoV.
The same strategy to dissociate immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment with SARS-CoV-2.
Interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
For example, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 in bats is failing.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a beta-CoV of bat sharing 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat sharing 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals on the market have been discovered as carriers of viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Beta-CoVs of the pangolin significantly similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that the pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that the pangolin beta-CoV could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, either voluntarily or accidentally.
The CoVs returned under the fire of the ramp due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of covs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Many evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and are transmitted to man by intermediate hosts.
Since the SARS-CoV infection comes from the contact between humans and civets on the markets, the closure of fresh product markets and the slaughter of civets on the market could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
Based on the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from fresh product markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, taking into account the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to man by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how such transmission occurs will remain to be determined in the following studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromadary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as has been done in the wild animals markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic covs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat covs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The opportunities are not lacking for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombin, causing the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or mortal CoVs in the future.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in certain regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the ravages caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity to contagion.
Although bats have many characteristics that support the spread of viruses, man's likelihood of being in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are aware of the need to stay away.
Continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of covs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the animal to humans and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonoses tanks.
Not all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parent virus from SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans come into contact with bats should be determined.
Thirdly, if a third mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether a bat, pangolin or other mammal should be identified, SARS-CoV-2 or the near-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will elucidate the evolving path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of VID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for the "suspect" and "confirmed" cases of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team issued a Rapid Recommendation Directive for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus 2019 infection (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic globally.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge are progressing gradually on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspect case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute coronavirus 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO qualified PID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research February 06, 2020.
It has attracted much attention since its publication.
Please note, however, that VID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are progressing slowly on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People ' s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) had seven editions in total between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which had been substantially modified.
Since our directive received a comment from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We welcome their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest Guidelines for Diagnostics and Treatment of VID-19 (Seventh Version Test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), confirmation of a suspect case must combine one of the elements of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to form a complete analysis, or correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the City of Wuhan and in neighbouring areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-COV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the City of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a confirmed case cluster (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in a 2 week space in a reduced area such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with the characteristics of an infection with COVID-19; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count from the beginning of the symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case must be based on the suspected case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the whole viral genome with strong homogeneity with known new coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG IgG; or modification of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from negative to positive or increase of title ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic blood sampling was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020) and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal kit for detection of nucleic acids for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood collection, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the addition of the positive result of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, increasing evidence reminds us of caution with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphical representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified individuals with no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
To conclude, we hope to develop more direct evidence and ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and follow the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new COVID-19-related deaths, a daily record
Yesterday Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to VID-19 in one day.
The country thus recorded a mortality record due to the virus within one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladeshi Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered infected persons included 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
The transportation of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still authorized.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded the million in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Mayor of Moscow, extended the constriction of the city until May 1.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Sonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics reversed the trend to reveal to what extent an HCoV infection could be devastating and potentially fatal.
Most HCoVs come from bats in whom they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Study of cov-host interactions in animals could also help to better understand cov in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, the CoVs are classified into four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV).The genus of Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoV) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The remaining five beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of the HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of the crossing of the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search of the tank, intermediate and amplifier host(s) of SARS-CoV-2, with significant implications for the prevention of future contamination.
Animal covs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tracts of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in pulmonary cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had classical cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and throat, with fever and cough observed in 10 to 20% of cases.
The HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present around the world and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter, in temperate climate countries.
Shops in Australia reduce limit of toilet paper by purchase
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian Woolworths and Coles stores reduced their purchase restrictions to two toilet paper and one package per purchase in all national stores, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit of a package.
These limits were displayed in the form of messages to the caisses and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers apparently collected reserves for fear of VID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, stated that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still in stock out of stock within the hour of delivery," and described the request as "unprecedented," while CIDA, in a Facebook release on Tuesday, described it as "unexpected".
Sales experienced a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the authorized quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce shortages, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while CIDA made stocks available earlier for a scheduled promotion Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult to do so.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are unable to honour the Wednesday promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr.Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector of the University of Technology of Queensland, explained that stores resupply stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper is a voluminous article, resulting in stocks of a small amount that, once exhausted, leave large empty spaces in rays, strengthening the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic," said Russell Zimmerman to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were breaking stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent paper, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate vendors offered free toilet paper at the first auction in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were organized because the buyers were on leave during the long weekend of the Labour Festival.
NT News' Thursday edition, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia in which they announced that they were not planning to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hygiene products for hands and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday evening that the British online supermarket Okado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization refers to pandemic VID-19
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current outbreak of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the pandemic's SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus).
Although the word “pandemic” refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO has indicated the need to push governments into action:
“All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries travel, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO.
"We are deeply concerned not only about the alarming levels of spread and gravity, but also about the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.
He stated, in a statement issued by CNN in February, that "except for influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been observed since its emergence until its continued spread worldwide."
Ghebreyes expressed a similar opinion, saying that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
What he added: "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: "To be brief, the situation will get worse."
Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an epidemic of coronavirus disease since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The lethality rate is estimated to be 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
There are no known vaccines or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and support therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth to cough, keeping away from other people, and monitoring and confiding suspected people to be infected.
The authorities around the world have responded by imposing restrictions on movement, quarantine, cover fires, workplace risk controls and establishment closures.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic disruptions, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as the widespread shortages compounded by panic shopping.
Schools and universities have shut down nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has been distributed over the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of origin and appearance from East and South-East Asia, as well as other people from many virus-related regions.
As a result of reduced travel and closures in the heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions were reduced.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the Hubei province) reported an unknown cause pneumonia outbreak on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most cases were related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and are therefore thought to be zoonotic.
The virus that caused the epidemic is known as SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person with symptoms had fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no apparent link to the subsequent home of the fresh produce market.
Two thirds of cases of the first home reported in December 2019 were found to be market related.
On March 13, 2020, an unaudited report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could go back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old person in the Hubei province. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases appeared to be declining in China but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, particularly among those with blessed symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, 19-year-olds and under 2.4 per cent of the world's cases. The UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance said that 60 per cent of the British population had to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of individuals who have been tested at VID-19, and whose testing has been confirmed in accordance with official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those who had only blessed symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that up to January 23, China estimated 86% of undetected VID-19 infections, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March found that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with VID-19 heal.
For those who do not heal, the time between symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years old, and 75 per cent were suffering from pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official counts of deaths related to the VID-19 pandemic usually refer to the deceased who were tested positive to VID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of VID-19 could be much higher, since it might not include untested deceased people - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy indicate that the mortality rates during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count for the deaths of the VID.
A spokesperson from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is underestimated," a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the underassessment in the United States. Such an underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the 2009 outbreak of swine flu H1N1 The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy, other than mainland China.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time spent since the onset of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global death report is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) to April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, case-death estimates decreased by 17.3% (for symptoms occurring between January 1 and 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for symptoms occurring after February 1, 2020). The other indicators are the rate of lethality (the rate of lethality), which represents the percentage of diagnosed people who fall victim to a disease, and the rate of infection (the rate of infection), which is the percentage of contaminated (the rate of diagnosed and undiagnosed) who fall victim to a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination after the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall rate of pandemic infection is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomised tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of tests on lethality estimates.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni from Pennsylvania State University said: "Uncontrollable, the infectious epidemics generally stabilize and then begin to decline when the disease comes to lack of available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant forecasts at the moment this happens."
China's Chief Medical Adviser Zhong Nanshan stated that "this could be completed by June" if all countries manage to mobilize to follow the WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two".
According to a study conducted by Neil Ferguson at Imperial College, physical distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (perhaps 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—as it is transmitted very easily—is completely disappearing" and that it could "be transformed into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year".
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes rather nonspecific and people infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO claims that about one in six people are severely ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as persistent difficulty breathing, pain or chest pressure, sudden confusion, severe alarms, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present. Further development of the disease may result in severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicaemia, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, so researchers have issued recommendations that individuals who have had close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between contamination and onset of symptoms) oscillates between one and 14 days; it is more often than five days. A good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost the smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly through close contact and through fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; this close contact corresponding to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by fine droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be projected by talking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected at expiry, notably by talking, although the virus is generally not flown.
Postillons can land in the mouth or nose of other people next door or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as incubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore cause air spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some are concerned that it can be transmitted by seals, this risk is considered to be low.
The Government of China has excluded the possibility of fecooral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of the symptoms, however the spread may be possible before the symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive for disease up to three days prior to symptoms suggesting transmission is possible prior to the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact searches.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if one does not yet know exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on the humidity and temperature. Domestic and other animals were tested positive at VID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the UK authorities recommend that they wash their hands after they have touched animals, as if they had been in contact with surfaces other than infected persons.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three pneumonia-related patients with Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the coronavirus related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think he'd be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis found that coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (lignage B) associated with two strains from bats.
It is 96% identical to the whole genome of another bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) sample.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acid in some parts of the genome sequences between the viruses from pangolins and those from humans.
The comparison of the whole genome to date has revealed a maximum of 92% common genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolin is the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however, the final confirmation is performed by reverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected or scanner secretions.
A study comparing the PCR with the Wuhan scanner suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, though less precise, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "the scanner should not be used to detect or as a first-intentional test to diagnose VID-19".
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on 17 January.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours or days.
Usually this test is performed on a sampling of rhinopharynx but one can also use a sampling of throat. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved to be reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The imaging elements characteristic of radiographics and tomodensitometry (scanners) for people with symptoms include asymmetrical depolious glass opacities and absence of pleural application.
The Italian Radiology Company is currently an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to cross-section with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed PCR imaging is limited to detect VID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of the chest scanners to the PCR and demonstrated that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its use as a screening tool in the epidemic areas.
Convolutive neurones networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in imaging both on X-rays and scanners.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a tissue and then throwing the tissue directly into a trash bag.
Those who were previously contaminated were recommended to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission, and many Governments have banned or denied all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in vast areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads to communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how it has been contaminated. Health care professionals are advised to take the usual precautions and contact precautions and wear protective glasses. The search for contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments in this regard has raised confidentiality issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communication calling for limitations to such monitoring.
Various mobile applications were launched or proposed on a voluntary basis, and from 7 April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the presence of a user near other mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positively at the COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, to rinse your nose and to gargarage with mouth bath is not effective.
There is no VID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are currently working to develop one vaccine.
It is advisable to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after they have been in the toilets or when the hands are apparently dirty; before eating; and after they have passed, sunk, or sneeze.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by soap cleaning, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using a disinfectant for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be decontamination in several ways (in a minute of exposure to disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62-71%, isopropanol at 50-100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5%, and iodized povidone at 0.2-7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzolkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of VID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a creche, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors used by sick persons, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and noses with their foldd elbow or handkerchief when they are coughing or sneezing, and to throw away any handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by projected postmen by speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Bring a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hygiene of the hands."The use of masks has also been recommended to those who care for a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended wearing masks for healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they are caring for a patient with VID-19, even if they recognize that wearing the mask can help people not touch the face.
Several countries have begun to encourage their population to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical tissue masks. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially in cases of proximity (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transportation or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to make face masks at home and to clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public exits without a mask or other means of covering their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone would protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government ordered that everyone entering a supermarket wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a public mask.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the wearing of the mask on passengers of long-distance trains and buses on 1 April.
Panama has made the wearing of a mask mandatory for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of a artisanal mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes measures to control infections to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
The methods of social distancing can be applied by staying at home, limiting his travels, avoiding crowds, welcoming himself without contact and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social distance in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by the U.S. government and health agencies has been reduced rapidly by 250 people (if there is no known VID-19 presence in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness and complications. Thus, they were invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began replacing the term "social distance" with "physical distance" to clarify the objective of reducing physical contact by preserving social links, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social distance" meant that there was a need for complete social isolation, rather than encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means. Some authorities published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with someone with whom one lives, who does not have the virus or who does not have the symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for individuals diagnosed positive to COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to individuals in the most at-risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a patient with VID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where transmission is very important were invited to be quarantined for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
Epidemiology control strategies are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
Detention is carried out during the first phases of the epidemic and is intended to monitor and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are turning to mitigation: measures are being taken to slow this spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Restraint and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The removal requires more extreme measures, in order to affect the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of an epidemic of infectious disease is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overburdening health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantine; public measures of social distance such as closure of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage the acceptance and participation of such interventions; and environmental actions such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures to reduce the epidemic have been taken in China as the severity of the epidemic becomes apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued alerts on the displacement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to people who have been quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has sanctioned the possession of medical supplies. Simulations for the United Kingdom and the United States show that mitigation (the slow but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and elimination (returning the development of the epidemic) face important challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the demand for health care by 2/3 and death by half, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
Elimination can be preferred, but should continue for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it occurs first), because otherwise, transmission quickly recurs upon release of the measures.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for VID-19, but development efforts are under way, including existing treatments testing.
Taking drugs without prescription against cold or drinking drinks and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can exacerbate the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of VID-19.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" can ease the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care for patients with VID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for primary health care hospitals and services to redeploy resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to the testing of VID-19, cancelling emergency response wherever possible, separating and isolateing patients tested positive to VID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories regarding the place of origin of the first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could go back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province in China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has increased gradually.
They are generally linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which was also selling live animals. According to a theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia home was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the hospital of the Hubei province, which informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan's central hospital warned their colleagues of a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public opinion on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub as well as a major railway correspondence.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States exceeded China and Italy by showing the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted movements and introduced border controls.
National responses included containment measures such as quarantine (also called home, shelter or containment orders) and cover fire. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are subject to a form of containment in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million to South Africa and 1.3 billion to India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people in the world experienced a form of containment, with a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the very first case would go back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a outbreak of unknown cause pneumonia on December 26, of which she informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on December 27.
Initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public opinion was issued by the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan on 31 December.
WHO was informed the same day.
The doctors in Wuhan received a warning that they had "promote rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no " manifest evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine of human history", a sanitary cordon was announced on January 23 to stop travel from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other facilities to Wuhan, such as congress and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to stem the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health reports for travellers and the extension of Spring holidays.
The country ' s universities and schools have also been closed down.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote labour measures have been introduced in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport was changed and museums in China were temporarily closed.
The control of population displacement has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have had some form of displacement restriction. After the epidemic entered the world in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day set-aside for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had moved within the country within the previous five days, in this case via a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang stated that the spread of cases transmitted within the country was essentially blocked, and that the epidemic was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the start of the detention. On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28, without specifying when this policy would end.

All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after three soldiers were tested positive to the virus.
The hours of the airlines have also been reached and have therefore been changed. South Korea has introduced what was considered the largest and best organized programme in the world to test the virus population, and isolate all infected persons, as well as follow and quarantine those who have been in contact with them.
Screening methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via mobile application, virus screening drives delivering results the following day, and increased test capacity to allow testing of nearly 20,000 people each day.
South Korea's programme is seen as a success in controlling the epidemic, although it did not put entire cities into quarantine. South Korea's society was initially divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be charged with mismanagement of the epidemic on the part of the government or, on the contrary, to praise its response.

CNN reports indicated that the combination of the large elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all people with the virus to date could have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first appeared to be one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK Government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass measurement on its citizens.
Therefore, the government was criticized for its manifest lack of reactivity and vitality in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, disapprove of all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting that people work at home if possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and showrooms.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure facilities such as pubs and gyms should close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages, within the £2,500 per month limit, to avoid the unemployment associated with the crisis.

On January 28, 2020, the Centre for Disease Control, the main public health institute of the U.S. government, announced that it had developed its own screening kit.
Despite this, the United States has taken time to start testing, which has obscured the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
The tests were affected by defective testing kits produced by the federal government in February, the federal government's lack of approval for non-governmental screening kits (universities, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria to qualify for a test until early March (order of a mandatory physician later).
On 27 February, The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been carried out in the United States.

On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in the regions of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the management and containment of the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of dissimulation, which hindered efforts to prevent and arrest, and the current crisis, where the central government "has provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the Moon Year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea pointed out that although it was not "certainly a WHO recommendation", it was a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and it referred to a fact "unprecedented in the history of public health." On 30 January, following the confirmation of interhuman transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO stated that the epidemic was an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the measure was invoked during the pandemic influenza A in 2009.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom stated that USPPI was due to the "risk of global spread, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros said: "there is no reason for measures to interfere unnecessarily with international trade and travel" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel".
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to support strategic preparedness in low-income countries, calling for the urgent need to support those countries that “don't have the systems to detect those who contracted the virus, even if it was about to appear”.
Tedros then said that we were "as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow." On February 11, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was called COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the “force of the entire United Nations system into the response”.
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team has been activated to coordinate the overall United Nations response, which, according to WHO, will enable them to “focus on the health response while other agencies will be able to provide their expertise in managing the wider social, economic and development implications of the epidemic”.
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated in China to dispatch international and WHO experts to China to support national management and assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with key national institutions and conducting field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including in urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of coronavirus", indicating that although it is too early to speak of a pandemic, each country should nevertheless enter the "preparation" phase.
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint on-site mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives stated that the global threat assessment for coronavirus had gone from "high" to "very high", its highest level of risk warning and assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the go and you should be ready," adding that the right response measures could help the world to avoid "the worst."
Ryan then indicated that current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we accept in absolute that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus".
On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronavirus epidemic could be described as a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was “extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction.” WHO faced significant criticisms about its management of the pandemic, which was considered inadequate, including due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition that encouraged WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts focused on respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone was entitled to relief and that this was the responsibility of the government.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never serve as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
The experts emphasized that each individual had the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are responsible for the economic and social impacts of the crisis in COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on political responses in different countries of the world, as well as views and advice.
Between policies for strengthening health systems and the global economy and responses to the effects of containment and displacement restrictions, the digital platform includes a Country Policy Tracker tool to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response to the Coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the British minister of the office of Michael Gove and the son of the president of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several Chinese Communist Party provincial administrators (CCP) were noted as a result of their 40-year-old management in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political leaders to the epidemic in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger in relation to the coronavirus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, e.g., Zhao Lijian, rejected the first idea that the coronavirus epidemic had begun in Wuhan in favour of conspiracyist theories that COVID-19 would hold its origins from the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump described the coronavirus as "China virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying that in China "censorship has super-fooded a virus that has become a global pandemic", which was subsequently taxed by some opponents and intended to "vert the attention of its administration's inability to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government outlining the main lines of a communication strategy that apparently emerged from the National Security Council, whose strategy is as follows: "It all comes from China.
We are asked to try to communicate this message in every possible way, including at press conferences and appearances on television." Press agencies such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg stated that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus were part of a push for propaganda to gain influence at the global level.
EU Head of Foreign Policy Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "a policy of generosity".
Borrell also stated that “China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, China is a responsible and reliable partner”.
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while prioritising its assistance to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma in Cuba were blocked by US sanctions on April 3.
The U.S. authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own countries.
Other mask-related conflicts have also been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of respirators for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that "only China had responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity".
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high political source" which indicated that 80 percent of Russian aid was "not even useful to Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of "geopolitical and diplomatic charm".
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft for medical assistance to the United States.
The spokesman for the Kremlin Dmitri Peskov stated that "by offering his American colleagues his help, [Poutine] is based on the principle that once American equipment and medical equipment manufacturers have gained momentum, they will be able to give them the same if necessary".
The scale of NATO's "Defender 2020" military exercise planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO manoeuvre since the end of the cold war, will be reduced.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of American troops and many participating European countries, but also those of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government was heavily affected by the virus, with about 20 members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen other former or current political figures.
Iran President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for assistance on 14 March 2020, indicating that his country had difficulty fighting the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to the United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic triggered calls on the United States to adopt common social policies for other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal child care programme, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to adversely affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election during the presidential election in 2020. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambigus and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine on government-designated sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially divided about the response to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be charged with mismanagement of the epidemic on the part of the government or on the contrary to praise its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to authorize Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule until further notice, to suspend the parliament and the elections, and to punish anyone who would have been accused of disseminating false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus epidemic has been accused of a number of supply disruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and a disruption in the operation of factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Agency for Food and Drug Products has issued warnings regarding the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have led to the disappearance of essential commodities, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, leading to shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has warned of delays in the shipment of electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for individual protective equipment has been multiplied by 100.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to 20 times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and WHO warns that this will put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for the Daigous to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of baby milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that followed, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products were a real success, avoiding the serious food shortages that had been planned in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its large agricultural production, Northern Italy did not see a significant decrease, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the town of Wuhan, while Chinese government members released pork reserves to ensure adequate livelihoods for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy to ensure that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.
The negative effects on the global economy were felt in China: According to a media report of March 16, the Chinese economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the government to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5 per cent.
Since mainland China was an important economic and manufacturing centre, it was found that the viral epidemic was a major destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit expected that markets would remain unstable until a clearer image emerges on potential outputs.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed that of the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004.
An expert estimate from Washington University in St.Louis reported an impact of over $300 billion on the global logistics chain that could last for up to two years.
The Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) would have “bleached” after a sharp fall in oil prices due to the decline in demand in China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February as a result of a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing concern about the coronavirus epidemic, several US stock market indices including the NASDAQ-100, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have shown their brightest falls since 2008, with a Dow Jones down to 1,191 points, the largest decline in one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with a fall of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign debt rating, but maintained a negative perspective.
The actions declined again due to concerns about coronavirus, with the largest decrease observed on 16 March.
Many believe that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures put in place by central banks and states.
Central banks react faster than they did at the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to a decrease in demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe failed.
The impact on the cruise sector has reached a level that has never been seen before.
Several stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's annual celebrations, and private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions independently, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the Lunar New Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including Beijing's Prohibited City and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, by requiring most workplaces not to reopen before that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of its exports.
Hong Kong has gone to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and declared an emergency situation, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with cuts in opening hours for shops or temporary closures.
Commercial visits to Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders experienced a 50-60% decrease.
This also led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic in commercial centres in March compared with February.
Operators of commercial centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as the increase in cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control customer temperature and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional people in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the approximately 300 million rural migrant workers were locked up in domestic provinces or stuck in the Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, according to estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The containment in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) with unemployment. The Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44 per cent of Canadian households had experienced a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the containment imposed in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Almost half a million German companies have switched their employees to a partially subsidised scheme of activity by the government called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time work compensation scheme was adopted by France and the United Kingdom.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations and individuals, both employed and independent, globally.
The arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often funded by the government) to provide access to the community's cultural heritage, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, all over the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions were closed to new orders and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which took place the last week of the period of Christian Lent of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live or television, while others propose to practice their worship as "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels and the Square of St. Peter, which has drained itself from all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies have also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday's prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the largest interruption in the world sports calendar since the Second World War.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 Champions League, the English Football Championship 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The outbreak disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Games, which were initially scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but by the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gaming institutions around the world closed and the live poker tournaments were either postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The world of the show has also been affected, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concerts.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway theatres, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in place of traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online "festivals" created for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their works.
On-line, many Internet members on the subject of coronavirus have spread because many prefer humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist sentiments expressed in different groups around the world, according to which the Chinese deserved the virus or received justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to the Chinese, whether online or offline, and to the residents of the virus-affected areas.
As a result of the spread of the epidemic to new sensitive countries, Italians, who live in the first European country to suffer a severe epidemic of COVID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have initially signed petitions to prohibit Chinese entry into their country in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been furious on Twitter.
The Chinese as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump faced the criticism that he described the coronavirus as "Chinese virus", a term considered by his detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, and students in major Indian cities, reportedly suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the unit of the Western Bengal of the Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them".
The remarks were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which calls them "false".In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese people were attracted by the pandemic, while foreigners were described as "foreign waste" that should be "eliminated".
Many paid-access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the free access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory screening of coronavirus 2019 respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for the detection of the virus and the detection of antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibodies (serology) can be used for both population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibodies show how many people contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too light to be reported or people with asymptomatic symptoms.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As at 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported lethality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimate in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, such as nasopharyngeal or exploration samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out from pharyngeal hides is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus can disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In the infected subjects tested during the second week, a sample can also be taken in deep respiratory tracts by aspiration catheter, or a crust (expectoration) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 with the help of reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on January 23, 2020.Kogenebiotech, South Korea, developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the Chinese National Medical Administration emergency use authorization for a PCR-CoV-2-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their RT-PCR diagnostic device in real-time for new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the old versions of the test kits, one in three genetic test achieved unconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of tests at the Atlanta CDCs. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only at this time that federal and local laboratories were authorized to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.The U.S. commercial laboratories started testing early in March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of the national IOC-19-based RT-PCR-based testing.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed tests of VID-19 nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced. Sample collection and processing shall be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Centre for Virology and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a test for the detection of infection at COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the FDA for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing as well as a device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorisation (EAA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA EA for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses the nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of the PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using monoclonal antibodies that specifically binds to the protein of the new coronavirus (protein N) is being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that it can provide results within 15-20 minutes, such as a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 bibliographical study concluded that "pulmonary X-rays have low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of the TDM [tomodensitometry] can be conclusive before even symptoms occur."
Typical symptoms on the TDM include multi-lobary bilateral depolious glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
A subpleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and a consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing the PCR with the TDM in Wuhan, at the origin of the current pandemic, suggested that the TDM is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, several of its imaging results coincide with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommends that "the TDM should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose VID-19."In March 2020, the CDCs recommend the PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals from about 7 days after symptoms occur, to determine immunity and population monitoring.Tests can be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or by test at the patient's back (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The automated high-speed systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, a single peripheral blood sample is generally used, although standard samples may be used to monitor immune response.
For PoCT, a single sample of blood is usually taken by skin punctuation.
Unlike the PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the Agency and which are therefore now able to distribute their antibody screening tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples within a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were sufficiently effective to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan that allows suspicious cases to remain in their homes, "the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients spit inside, return it and later receive the test result.The British NHS has announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient will infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use.In the context of the VID-19 test for suspected cases, a health professional will take a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The drive centres allowed South Korea to perform one of the fastest and most comprehensive screenings in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians stated on March 2 that it had the capacity to perform approximately 12,000 daily tests in an ambulance facility, and that 10,700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
Costs are borne by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive tests were available in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to week 12/2020, and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) achieved a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, Technion and Rambam hospital researchers developed and tested a 64 patient sample analysis method at a time, combining the samples and testing only if the combined sample was positive.In Wuhan, an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2,000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese: "Eye of Fire" in French) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, and can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
Thanks to its construction in 5 days supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, modelling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capacity.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Free, multiplexed models developed by Origami Assays were published to test up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without a liquid robot.
In March, insufficient shortages and quantities of reagents became a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to examine protocols for the preparation of samples that involve heating the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes in order to continue the screening.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now the country testing the majority of its population per capita for Coronavirus, and was in the process of intensifying the screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were obtained through a combination of drive-test capability and the purchase of a population-wide broadband laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to be able to operate outside China.
Various test forms targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for making kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was published only on January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and testing recommendations of health specialists.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the Government of South Korea.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of screening programs as the best way to slow down the development of the VOC pandemic-19.The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to hundreds of thousands of tests being delayed in private laboratories in the United States, and the reserves of scavengers and chemical reagents have exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported issues related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the U.S., the test kits developed by CDCs were "defects", and the government eliminated bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing.Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that incorrect results could be related to the inability to collect samples or properly use kits.
The Spanish ministry stated that it would remove the kits that had given the wrong results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased in China by the Czech Republic provided false results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits in China which proved to be unsuccessful.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested to throw them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey stated that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them." The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced at the beginning of April 2020 that they were unusable.
The screening, followed by 40 of those who achieved a positive result and the tracking of people who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, produced positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place of the first death related to the COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests for the entire population of about 3,400 people, approximately ten days apart.
Almost half of those who achieved a positive outcome did not have symptoms, and all the discovered cases were quarantined.
With the restriction of movement in the municipality, this measure has completely eliminated the new infections.
As a result of aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much less quickly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened at the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracking, travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containment, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are more capable of detecting people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and national laboratories have limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories to carry out confirmation tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive % Tests" column depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only those admitted to hospital will have a positive value as a percentage of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
The washing of hands, also known as hand hygiene, corresponds to cleaning of hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal means.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. the mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after the defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing the layers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
If you have no water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands at ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the layers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after sinking or casting/sterning;
after touching an animal, animal food or animal waste;
Hand hygiene in medical settings refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering drugs or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause diseases) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and the reduction in the infant mortality rate during home delivery.
According to a 2013 study, improving hand hygiene practices could result in a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50%.
The introduction of actions to promote hand washing could reduce diarrhoea episodes by about a third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing soap hands reduces diarrhoea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and cost-effective means of preventing diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). This is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major IRAs, is the first cause of death in children under five years of age, which causes nearly 1.8 million deaths a year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia lead to the death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce death from diarrhoea by almost half and death from acute respiratory infections by one quarter.
Hand washing is generally associated with other sanitary measures under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor harmful effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing a skin dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to hand-level eczema or dermatitis, characterized by squamous skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash hands with soap at five key times of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of the diseases: before and after using the toilets (miction, defamation), after cleaning the buttocks of a baby (or changing its layers), before feeding a child, before and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw poultry.
Hands should also be properly washed to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after treating a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or sinking, after touching animal waste or handling animals and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand-cleaning with soap is low.
According to a survey conducted in 2015 with 54 countries on hand hygiene, 38.7 per cent of households averaged their hands with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate (97%), the United States was in the middle of the table (77%), and China had the lowest rate (23 %). There are now several methods to change behaviour and democratize the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day. In developing countries, it is possible, in particular, to propose to schoolchildren to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day to make children a habit of doing so.
For example, the Department of Philipinne Education has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote the health and education of children.
Deparasite twice a year, associated with daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing of teeth with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles to the solution and to increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin since lipids and proteins, which are organic substances of the soil, are hardly soluble in the water.
An adequate water flow, however, facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria were washed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) nevertheless states that "automatic liquid soap distributors are preferable".
Antibacterial knowledge was strongly recommended to people concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of antiseptics or recommended disinfectants can target organisms that are resistant to antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as predicted.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protective agent, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) that regulate pH, benzoic acid, having antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon Public Health School indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water to eliminate natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or antiseptic for hands is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-aqueous alcohol-based hygiene products (probably referred to as hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or disinfectants for hands) began to become popular.
Most are formulated based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thickening agent such as the carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a humidant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the assuring effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide strengthens antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRRAs and ERVs), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 log equivalent to 35 decibels) of hand-held bacteria 30 seconds after application and 99.99% (reduction of 4-5 log) of hand-held bacteria 1 minute after application.Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectants for hands or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to wet well or cover both hands.
The palm and back of the two hands and the interstices between the fingers and nails should be fronted for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or dry gel is present.
The tip of the fingers should also be cleaned by rutting them, palm against palm.The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are apparently dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace hand washing unless you have no water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or skin moisturizing agents.
The alcohol-absorbing effect may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients produced significantly less irritation and skin dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydroalcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritant contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than hand washing with water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not eliminate the organic substances present in the hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, disinfectants for the hands are not as effective as soap and water to avoid the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectants for non-alcoholic hands depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas that use benzolkonium chloride have shown sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after administration, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many do not have the means to buy soap, rather using ash or land.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease instead of inhibiting it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends proper hand washing to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make any difference).
Put a generous amount of soap on your hands by rubming one against the other, not forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap eliminates the germs of the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frozen for at least 20 seconds.
The action to rub creates friction, which helps eliminate the germs of the skin, and rub longer remove more germs.
Rinse abundantly with running water.
rinsing in a stagnant watershed may lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and wet hands recover more easily.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and underneath the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can accommodate microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to washing hands when tap water and/or soap are not available, such as pouring water from a can or cane that is suspended and pierced and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are alternatives to saving water, such as "tippy-steps" and other economic options.
A tippy tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended crucible using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is discussed.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric dryers often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the whole paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air dryers and more modern air jet dryers.
After hand washing and drying in hot air, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194 per cent on the finger pulp and 25 per cent on the palms.
Drying of the air-jet air-jet resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After hand washing and drying with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the finger pulp and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was cross contamination potential with other toilet users and the toilet environment according to each drying method.
The air-jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the device at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of ejecting micro-organisms from the hands and the device and possibly contaminating other users of the toilet as well as the toilet environment within a range of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air dryer allows the diffusion of microorganisms at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in the bacterial count were observed:
There are many different dryer manufacturers, and the dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
hand washing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
The washing of hands in a medical environment became compulsory soon after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
The medical hand washing must last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to grind and rub each part of the hands.
Hands must be rubbed against each other, passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hairbrush to remove them.
Since the germs present in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This helps to avoid retaliating hands to the contact of the surfaces.
The goal of hand washing in health structures is to remove and prevent pathogens ("germs").
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical establishments, with many doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before reaching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, washing hands correctly and following other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood infections related to catheters by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure to be followed to wash and rub hands in the area of health.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines prepared by the Organization may also be consulted on the website to collect comments from the Internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and certify hand hygiene if compliance with the regulations is demonstrated.
The World Health Organization defines "five indications" for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (such as "medicinal" or "antimicrobial") gives the hand washing agent an action to destroy the germs.
It is desirable to eliminate these germs before performing a surgical operation or in environments where antibiotic resistant organisms are very widespread. In order to "frotter" the hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine-based wash product, sterile towels to dry the hands after washing them, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When flushing, water on the forearms should be avoided from falling to the hands.
Once the hands have been washed, the hands should be dried using a sterile cloth and a surgical case.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is preferable to wash hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after dealing with a sick person.
Regarding the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20 per cent of the wash, and that very few additional benefits were available to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35 per cent.
By comparing hand washing with a common soap with an antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing hand cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, the first reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A (H1N1) virus and severe Clostridium spores present on the hands. In order to improve the hygiene of the hands in health care institutions, it is possible, inter alia, to train staff in hand washing, make more alcohol-based products available to the hand and to provide written and verbal reminders on this subject.
Further research is needed to identify the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered to be a low-cost and essential tool for maintaining health and even for proper feeding.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find taps to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be due to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
The promotion of soap hands and awareness-raising activities can influence policy decisions, publicize the benefits of soap hands and lead to a change in long-term behaviour within the population.
In order to achieve this, monitoring and evaluation activities need to be carried out.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of hand washing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to promoting hand washing in schools, the example of UNICEF's "Three-Star Approach", which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules, is cited.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the campaigns to promote the hygiene of hands that are being carried out in order to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Hand Wash Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that claims to promote behavioural change.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of a hand wash emoji.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the number of years of healthy living gained (i.e. avoided DALY).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have just given birth or injured soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetid smells called miasmes.
In the 1980s, food-borne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more actively hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the VID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany posters depicting "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It is derived from a biblical verse by Matthew in which Ponce Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth's Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth is trying to wash her hands compulsively to try to clean up an imaginary spot, a symbol of her misconception of the crimes she committed and that she encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also noted that some individuals, after remembering that they have committed or planned to commit acts contrary to ethics, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to give more value to hand washing devices.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had such thoughts are less inclined to engage in other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe washing hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is part of the rituals of washing hands promoted in many religions, including Bahaism and Hinduism, Tevilah immersion and ritual bleeding of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, lavabo in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe washing hands for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is compulsory to wash hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
Risk controls of VID-19 at the workplace
The workplace risk controls of COVID-19 refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Controls of appropriate risks at the workplace vary depending on the workplace and the tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the individual risk factors of workers who may be vulnerable to an infection with VID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, lower risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic anti-infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory labeling, and maintaining a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium exposure risk jobs include those who require frequent or close contact with persons without suspected or known COVID-19 but who may be infected by ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and certain large-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic glass and the provision of individual protective equipment in case of encounter with a person with COVID-19.
OHSA considers health and funeral workers exposed to individuals with suspected or known COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, at a very high risk if they perform procedures that produce aerosols or sampling or handling of individuals with suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment adapted to the task.
VID-19 epidemics can have several effects at the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, have to take care of others or fear possible exposure.
Commercial models may change, both in terms of the goods requested and the means to acquire them (including shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of articles from geographic areas severely affected by VOC-19 may be interrupted. A plan for the preparation and response to infectious diseases may be used as a guide for protective measures.
Plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, family and community risk factors and individual risk factors for workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also provide the necessary controls to deal with these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Plans to prepare and respond to infectious diseases may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
The disease response objectives include reducing staff transmission, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The risk control hierarchy provides a comprehensive framework for occupational health and safety in order to group risk controls by efficiency.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and personal protective equipment.
Technical checks mean that employees are isolated from work-related risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers. They can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls refer to changes in labour policies or procedures that require action by the worker or the employer.
Individual protective equipment (EPI) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPIs must be selected according to the worker's risk, appropriately adapted to the needs (e.g., respiratory masks), worn properly and systematically, inspected regularly, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or re-assigned to prevent contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, low-exposure jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
Basic measures to prevent the recommended infection for all workplaces include frequent and careful hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, the respiratory label, including covering their mouth and nose to cough and sneeze, providing handkerchiefs and trash, preparing for teleworking or working hours staggered as necessary, deterring workers from using the tools and equipment of others, and maintaining the routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms stay at home until they have no more fever, signs of fever or any other symptom for at least 24 hours without the use of fevers or other medicines acting on the symptoms. They also recommend applying flexible disease leave policies, allowing employees to stay at home to take care of a member of the sick family and informing employees of these policies.
According to OHSA, medium-risk jobs include those requiring frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), of persons without suspected or known COVID-19 but who may be infected with SARS-COV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to a region with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes workers in contact with the general public in particular in schools, high-density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly efficient air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygiene windows and the installation of a drive window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of personal meetings by virtual communications, the setting up of phased working hours, the interruption of non-essential travel to regions with COVID-19 active epidemics, the development of emergency communication plans, including a forum to respond to workers' concerns, the provision of information and training on the risks of COVID-19 working hours, the interruption of non-essential travel to regions with COVID-19 active epidemics, the development of emergency communication plans to respond to the concerns of workers, the provision of up-to-date training on the risk factors of traffic control, the control of traffic and the control of traffic, and the control of traffic of traffic, and the management of traffic, and the management of traffic, and the management of traffic of traffic, and the management of traffic, and the management of traffic, and the management of traffic, and the management of traffic, and the management of transport and the management of the management of transport and the management of transport and the equipment, and the management of transport, the equipment, and the equipment of transport, and the equipment, the equipment, and the equipment, and the equipment, and the, and the equipment, and the equipment, and the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, and the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, and the control, of of the equipment, of the equipment and the safety of of of of of of of of the safety, of of of of of of the equipment, of, of, of the equipment, of, of, of transport, of transport, and the equipment, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of the,, of the equipment, of, of,, of the equipment,, of of of,, of, and of of of, of, of, of of the, and of the, and of of of of of the transport, of the transport and of the transport, of, of, of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, of,,,,,,,,,, of, of, of,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, of, of, and of, of the, of the, of the, the, of the, of the, of the, the, the, of the, the of the, the, and the, and the of the of the, the, the, the, and, the, the, the, the, and of the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, and of, the, the of the of the of the of the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, and of the, and of the was of the, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and of the, the was of the was was was, and of, and, and, and of, and, and of, and of, and, and, and, of the, and, of, and, of, of, and, of, of, of, and, of, of, of, of, and of, of, of of, of, and of, of of of, and, and of, of, and of, of, of, of the, the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the, the, the, the, the, the, the, and of of of of of of, of of of, of of of, of of of, of of of, of of of, of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of the, the, of, and, of, of the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the of the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the of the of the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the and of, the, the and the and the and of, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and, and of, and, the, the, and, of, and of, of, and the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the of the of the of the of the of the of the of
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include: separating the patient from the other person by a distance of 6 feet; assigning a crew member to care for the patient and providing a protective mask to the patient or asking him or her to cover his or her mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when dealing with a sick passenger or with organic liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
The gloves and other disposable items must be put back in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, the risk controls include the delay of travel in case of illness, as well as the self-insulation and immediate information of the on-board medical centre if a fever or other symptoms are developed once on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up must be carried out in the isolated person's cabin. For schools and childcare, CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has travelled to a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the case of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distance strategies may be implemented, such as cancellation of educational exits, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir courses or canteen meals, increasing space between offices, staggering arrival and exit hours, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with flu symptoms.
In case of significant transmission to the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, an extension of school holidays can be considered. For law enforcement personnel performing routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by CDCs.
The law enforcement personnel who have to contact persons with COVID-19 suspected or confirmed must follow the same guidelines as ambulances, including the wearing of adequate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belts before re-use using a linen or spray cleanser and follow the standard procedures for the containment and re-start of used EPIs, as well as the containment and washing of clothing.
OHSA regards certain health and funeral workers as belonging to categories of high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at high risk of exposure if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling of patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include incubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling of samples.
High-risk funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of bodies with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of death; they are at a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including in the implementation of procedures producing aerosols.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral settings.
Samples shall be handled using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other IPRs, OHA recommends respiratory masks for people working less than 6 feet from patients with a suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and those performing procedures that produce aerosols.
In the United States, N95 respiratory filtration masks approved by NIOSH or higher must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide the worker with superior protection and comfort. WHO does not recommend combinations, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
WHO only recommends the wearing of a surgical mask by screening personnel at the point of entry.
For those who collect, support or carry patients in the absence of aerosol procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses or facial screens, blouses and gloves.
In the event of a procedure producing aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Given the lack of global supply of IPRs, WHO recommends limiting the need for IPRs through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a patient-occupied location COVID-19 to persons directly involved in its care, the use of IPRs for the specific task only, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the care of several patients with the same diagnosis, the monitoring and coordination of the IPR supply chain and the deterrence of the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

OBJECT: [Covid-19] Easy load and prepare for the future
DATE OF REVISION: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE : CC0 : No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community strengthening at the heart of this organization at the global level.
The peership and kindness we have seen among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I could no longer be grateful and proud to have all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone told me his gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipédia at the moment, and the strong symbol of the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs information from Wikipédia, now more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we are doing, but also how we are doing, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make substantial adjustments to the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and our time jobs
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team met last night to discuss our approach and our use of time in the coming days and months.
During this discussion, we considered what would be an appropriate response to the situation we face and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
First and foremost, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don't worry.
To all staff, subcontractors and contractors:
Our daily working time target will be approximately 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, shopping or consulting a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we say so.
No sick leave or paid leave required: just warn your superior and help your team to review the schedules and jobs of time to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive at COVID-19, please inform Bryan of the T&amp;C Ops department that T&amp;C will help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from management).
The hourly staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities towards our subcontractors and colleagues in the hourly workforce.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual hours of work under normal conditions.
This is true if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means of evacuating the stress of the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in periods like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things that we must continue to do.
SRE teams, Ops HR, Security and Fund-raising (among others) carry out critical work that might require reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most necessary projects.
Slow down now will not hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice as much to catch up with lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to do overtime to respect now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set new goals and timetables as appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working time targets, we plan to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to prepare a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, take care of them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their working hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as confirmed.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office by excessive caution.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol that uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork location, which shared with us and all Washington DC based staff its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As some of our New York colleagues know, we also discussed the idea of renting a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are continuing but may be adjourned.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to working at a distance are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the length of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider distributing them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and online exchanges.
Place a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take a collective note).
Send an e-mail to the technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your well-being rebate for snacks.
Join the channel #remotions on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations Team is studying ergonomic guidelines based on webinars to support the increase in the distribution of work within the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel the public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized for delay or modification of these objectives.
Next week we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sad in the face of the shift and relief from clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the future, the CRT is working on the creation of a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite issues related to VID-19
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
By then, you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all the other essential information related to the COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all information at the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, a major workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and to ensure the necessary liaison.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of Global International Operations HR.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, it is a question of recognizing that at present our work and obligations are likely to have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps that we think are necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to offer the world the service on which everyone can count.
Our planned work will be there to wait for the moment to come.
For the moment, it is time to help and prepare for the important work that will happen in the weeks and perhaps the months to come.
We need each of you to achieve this, which is why you need to preserve yourself and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself the time that comes.
Finally, please, wash your hands and do not touch your face!

b'Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme is an enzyme linked to the external face (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of certain coronaviruses.
Human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a metalloenzyme containing zinc on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a C-terminal amino acid carrier collective.
ACE2 is a unique type I membrane protein, the active domain of which is exposed to the surface of the lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleavage from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is related to the cellular membrane mainly cells of type II pulmonary alveoles, enterocytes of the intestinal tract, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and artery cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also present in the brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain trunk.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate ACE.
The ACE enlivens angiotensin I hormone in vasoconstrictive angiotensin II.
The ACE2 in turn clives the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylamine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and the vasodilating angiotensin hydrolysis (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also cling to several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghréline.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the SLC6A19 neutral amino acid carrier and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main point of entry into the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes VID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 spy protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 to the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and in the translocation of both virus and enzyme into the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of S protein by host serum protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard treatment with ACE and BRA inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34% in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with an ACE inhibitor who have a higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less likely than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The human recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme (rhACE2) is an innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the action time is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS) or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. rhACE2 by infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracing of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of individuals ("contacts") who may be in contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the government in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, particularly those based on tracking the geographical location of users of applications, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature that will support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to verify that they have been in contact with people carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application called Tracetogether.
Developed by a local community of computer scientists, it was provided as an open source and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application to track exposure to potentially infected people and to communicate quickly with the health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technologies and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was pending approval by the Google Play Store and the App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are planning to implement applications on the Tracetogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a georepair application for patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis resident in Moscow, in order to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, raised several possible practical problems related to the use of applications-based systems, including false positives and lack of potential effectiveness if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" organizations or generally trusted organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists expressed concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the remote threat has been addressed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a declaration calling for such restrictions.
These organizations have provided for eight conditions to be met in the context of government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Extensions of control and monitoring should include extinction clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of the control of VID-19;
data security and anonymity should be protected in a demonstrable manner;
Digital surveillance should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalisation is avoided;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
Protections against abuse and remedies for citizens should be provided for in case of abuse;
The "important involvement" of all "stakeholders concerned" would be mandatory, including those of public health experts and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy concerns.
However, all systems based on central servers do not need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers solely for intercommunication purposes, allowing privacy to be respected (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, which they subsequently associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made localization information available to the public, which was allowed as a result of profound changes to the privacy laws of the information after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is publicly available through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have envisaged the use of centralized privacy systems.
Details had not yet been provided on April 6, 2020.
Privacy-friendly contacts tracking is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data in 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked on privacy-friendly solutions, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordinating effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preservation Proxy Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly named Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leaves the device and that all matchings are made on the device.
The MIT Media Lab's Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy technologies in the collection and use of location or contact data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a company developing privacy technologies initially based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups grouped around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a broad public.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would help preserve privacy and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology with a confidential cryptography.
They also published the basic technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to allow governments to create formal privacy-based coronavirus tracking applications
Direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to resolve problems of adoption of the solution and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through the update of the operating system and subsequently removing it in the same way once the remote threat.
Repositioning of a medicinal product (also referred to as reorientation, reprofiling, redeploying or changing therapeutic indication of a medicinal product) means the conversion of a medicinal product approved for a disease or for a medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments against VID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and plasma transfusion of convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 target proteins, each with several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides the realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral drug against the proteins of COVID-19.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-type protease, RNA dependent polymerase RNA, helicase, S protein and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an anti-palude medicine also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that New York State tests for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use authorisation (EAA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is permitted under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospital patients but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors indicated that they use this medicine "when there are no other options."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School conducts a test on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen stated that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average period of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them received favipiravir and half received umifenovire.
The Italian Medicines Agency has reminded the public that the evidence available in favour of the medicinal product is slim and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug in Japan for its reserves and that it would use the army to deliver the drug to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug can be less effective in serious cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to breed.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded "that no benefit was observed".
These drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would link to SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of specially developed drugs for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies prior to the trial suggest that redesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are under way, two of which are conducted by Cleveland university hospitals; one for people with moderate pathology and the other for those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with VID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The state of New York began testing for azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of alvesco (ciclesonide) of Teijin, a corticosteroid for inhalation used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is under way with 200 patients to be recruited from severe hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the efficacy of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate symptoms of VID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults 40 years and older who have been diagnosed positive to VID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women or women who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian Agency for Medicinal Products to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study of 300 patients and studying the use of enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Given that SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, many researchers focused on the repositioning of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as the SARS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of VID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as treatments for VID-19:
tocilizumab (anti-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also under way in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many development attempts are under way.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, a virus causing the disease, for at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were under phase I safety study.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic was reported around the world in 2020, generating significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the CEPI initiative's imperatives for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists indicated that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against VID-19.
The targets of the main platform for Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biology, adenoviral vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 other announced, but with little public information available (summary in the course of planning or design).
A Phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomised, controlled against placement and performed in several centres while determining more precise effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring the adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccine candidates confirmed at the beginning of April 2020, 74 were not yet in the human person assessment phase (all in "pre-clinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular brush vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that it had begun to work on a vaccine, the human testing of which is expected to begin in 2021.
Vaccination development projects were announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at Hong Kong University on January 28.
In the vicinity of January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started working on the development of a vaccine.

On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in accelerated procedures, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, reported developing a particle similar to coronavirus with the partial funding of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is being researched in the laboratory, with human testing planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "high amounts of money to benefit from exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine", which led to the protest of the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an RNA-based vaccine.
The BNT162 NRA-based vaccine candidate is currently in the preclinical test phase with the start of the clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have pre-clinical test results in April 2020 and that the test on the man of his final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemiological Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$ 4.9 million in a consortium for the research of a vaccine against COVID-19 including the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, thus bringing the total CEPI investment in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to US$ 29 million.
The other CEPI investment partners for the development of a VID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifier RNA vaccine against VID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of the sequence being sent by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against VID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian societies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Government of Canada announced the allocation of $192 million for the development of a VID-19 vaccine with projects to create a national "bank of vaccines" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh's Medical School reported that "the SARS-CoV-2 S1 micro-conductor vaccine subunits triggered an important response of the specific antigen antibodies [see mice] observed 2 weeks after immunisation."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, Waterloo University's pharmacy school announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with cloud-hosted computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they warn.
Another randomised trial in Australia includes 4,170 health professionals.
Developmental vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the effectiveness of a vaccine using animal models specific to COVID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicate a need for implementation of level 3 biosecurity containment measures for live virus handling, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there are no curative or protective vaccines against SARS that have demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There were no MERS tested vaccines.
When the SARS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs for a MRS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were in progress; all vaccines were viral, two adenomiral (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-MERS-S.
Social media publications disseminated a conspiracy theory that the virus that caused VID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents covering genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can oscillate between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause moderate symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have healed. The virus spreads mainly during close contact, often through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Since these droplets are produced upon expiry, they generally fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms occur, although it is possible before symptoms occur and in subsequent stages of the disease. The standard test method uses reverse transcription of polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
The recommendations regarding the wearing of the mask by the public generally vary, some authorities do not recommend its use, others recommend its use, and others still insist on its use.
There are currently no specific vaccines or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking, face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal flow or throat pain can be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in various proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some patients, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period of VID-19 is usually five to six days, but may last up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of non-sympathetic infected people is currently unknown and is currently being studied. Korean Disease Prevention and Control Centres (KCDCs) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; out of 166 infections observed today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both exploration and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking loudly frees more droplets than speaking normal.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and air collectors located in the corridor outside the patient chambers produced positive samples to viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as incubation and cardiopulmonary reanimation (CPR) may disperse respiratory secretions and thus cause air spread.
Although there are concerns about feces spreading, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread may be possible before symptoms occur, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if one does not yet know exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and four hours on copper at 99%.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which deactivates and eliminates the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzolkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the onset of hospitalisation.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was tested on the second day.
Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three patients with pneumonia associated with Wuhan’s acute respiratory disease.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronavirus related in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus reaches the host cells through the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) which is the most abundant in lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicle" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart lesions were reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan Hospital, China, and are more common when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be related to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and heart functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with VID-19 infections and may be associated with adverse prognostics. Autopsies of people who died from VID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism in respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE-2, severe COVID-19 patients have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
In particular, GM-CSF secretory T cells have been associated with the recruitment of IL6 secretory inflammatory monocytes and severe pulmonary disease in patients with VID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates have also been reported in autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, nasal or exploration sampling can also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours, or up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but they require two blood samples taken at two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independent chain polymerization reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (susceptible to detect active infections and a person's previous infection) were being developed, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed a precision of only 60 to 70 per cent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test near the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods of detection of infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobary bilateral depolitic glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Pleural dominance, crazy paving (interlobular septic thickening with variable alveolar complementation) and consolidation may occur with disease progression.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: crying, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia may be observed:
Moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffused alveolar damage (ADD) with diffused alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxaemia.
healing pneumonia: organisation of exudates in elveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Sang: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leucoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying home, avoiding cramped areas, frequent washing of hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding eye, nose or mouth contact with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends to cover the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and to use the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Correct hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered with a tissue in public places, in order to limit transmission in the case of asymptomatic individuals.The social distance strategies aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing displacement and cancelling important groups of people.
The distance guidelines also include a minimum 6 foot (1.8 m) distance between people.
There are no drugs known to be effective in preventing VID-19. Given that a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element of the management of VID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also referred to as "platting the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after they have been in the toilets or when the hands are apparently dirty; before eating; and after they have passed away, sunk, or sneeze.
It also recommends that a disinfectant solution be used for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available.
In these formulae, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is "not an active antiseptic substance for the hands".
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support from other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analysed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful in those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized individuals for COVID-19.
Restimating and pneumologist physicians in the United States have gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there was no specific treatment for VID-19.
With respect to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen on the front line.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly under conditions of care when procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health care professionals who are caring for people suffering from VID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in a isolation chamber suitable for air infection (IIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and air transmission precautions. The CDC stresses the guidelines for the use of individual protective equipment (IPS) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (facial masks) are preferred.
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorisation (EAA).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unidentified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial protection screens, or as a last resort, artisanal masks.
The majority of cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with respiratory failure associated with VID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized individuals. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided by using a high-flow nasal channel or positive pressure of double-level respiratory tracts.
It is not known whether either or both generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some physicians prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal channel. Serious cases are more common in older adults (more than 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to deal with a sudden peak in the number of cases of COVID-19 sufficiently serious to require hospitalization.
One study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with high pressure control and PEPE are required to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung damage associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
The high PEPE may not be available on older ventilation devices.
Research into potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs is being tested.
Remdesivir appears to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs are already approved in other indications and tests are already being developed.
An antiviral drug may be tried in people with severe illness.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in tests on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. FDA granted temporary authorization to plasma of convalescent individuals as experimental treatments in cases where the life of the individual is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not recommend only self-destructive, it also alerts local health authorities. The analytics of mass data from mobile telephones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected persons and persons with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data from suspected coronaviruses.
The purpose of the measure was to ensure that quarantine was respected and to protect those who might have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared aggregate telephone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said that he was informed by mobile telephone operators that “40% of people continue to travel”.
The German government has conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
The Estonian President, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for creative solutions at the global level to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC cited Rory O'Connor as saying, "Enhanced social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may develop moderately with little or no symptoms, similar to other common diseases of the respiratory tract such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19 based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are lacking. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADR) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-viscal failure.
Complications associated with VID-19 include septicaemia, coagulation disorders, and cardiac, renal and hepatic lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of hospitalized cases with VID-19, with renal impairment occurring in 4% of patients in this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the mean time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which had passed in hospital.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early study, the mean time between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem pulmonary samples show diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADS).
In 11.8 per cent of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had pre-existing pathologies, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region can also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the disease mortality rate vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The undernumber of moderate cases may result in an overestimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of VID-19 and are at a 2.4-fold higher risk of going to intensive care or dying compared to non-smokers. Concerns also emerged over long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital administration observed a 20-30% drop in respiratory capacity in some patients who were cured of the disease, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic damage.
This can also lead to post-healing post-healing post-healing syndrome.
In March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection provided effective long-term immunity in healthy individuals.
Immunity is considered likely, on the basis of behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of cured subjects of COVID-19 followed by positive tests of coronaviruses at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be aggravation of latent infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and of animal origin, by spread of infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively caused by a man-to-man transmission.
A study of the 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the oldest date of onset of symptoms dates back to December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary between regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time spent since the onset of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency disease codes CIM-10 U07.1 for laboratory confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for COVID-19 case deaths diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without infection in SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in laboratory. The death/case report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death/case ratio is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the rate of lethality (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die of the disease and the rate of infectious lethality (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed or not) who die of a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination after the disease.
Although not all infected individuals develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and not all deaths related to VID-19 may have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overrun.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to VID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different between men and women.
Human mortality is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among men 50 years of age, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors could be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and development in men of co-morbidities such as hypertension at a less advanced age than in women could have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men and 72% of the people who died from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data on the gender of VID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), an animal species or a group of individuals, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigma. The virus causing COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "VID-19 virus" and "VID-19 virus responsible" in its public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of the 2019-nCov provisional disease names and 2019-nCov acute respiratory disease for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limitations of the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as sinks and respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respiratory valve and the supplier could not supply it in due time, a local startup redesigned and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is capable of spreading the disease to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on VID-19 vaccines and drugs is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY test to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection with VID-19.
A second strategy, sub-unit vaccines, is aimed at creating a vaccine that raises the immune system awareness of certain virus sub-units.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these researches focus on the S-spic protein that helps the virus infiltrate into the ACE 2 receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new technique for vaccine creation).
Experimental vaccines from all of these strategies are expected to be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibodies-dependent activation was suggested as a potential challenge in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved treatment against malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reversed antiviral drugs make up the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on redesivir in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of vaccine candidates and drugs against COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggest the efficacy of redesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with co-administered redesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some are calling for an independent analysis of research.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan virology institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that twice that dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency-use authorisation at the discretion of physicians treating patients in COVID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin, or umifenavir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spy protein starting with serum 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have any known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinial shock may be a complications at subsequent stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine anti-choc properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is currently undergoing a phase 2 test that is not randomised at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Along with a blood test of serum ferritin to identify cytokine shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to cause the death of some affected individuals.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of anti-refractory cytokine enlargement syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of the SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of individuals who have cured from COVID-19 to those who need them is being studied as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralisation is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody-based treatment can generate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example by using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of convalescent human serum, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for a faster deployment.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a physician at Wuhan Central Hospital, who then contracted the VID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
