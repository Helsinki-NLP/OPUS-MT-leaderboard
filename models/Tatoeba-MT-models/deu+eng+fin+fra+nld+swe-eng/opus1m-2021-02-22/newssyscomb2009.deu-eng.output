Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, overall they reach 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties by the previous large coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led to the early parliamentary elections in Austria in the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously at stake, suffered particularly severe losses.
In contrast, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian Head of State Jörg Haider, is prepared for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to previous results, Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 per cent of the votes, but loses 5.5 per cent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially in the People's Party which had demanded the advance elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had resigned from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advantage over the SPÖ.
However, voters probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party president and former vice-chanzler Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party Executive Board.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. for a renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) received a provisional 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - the Social Democrats simultaneously expressed their fear that the year 1999 could repeat themselves when the People's Party had agreed with the populists (at that time, the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) with regard to a joint government, which had even brought about sanctions on the part of the European Union.
This development is clearly based on Jörg Haider, who already stated that he was willing to cooperate with each party and is starting from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal politics.
In addition, the Greens' party also moved into Parliament, but it suffered slight losses and dropped from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent charge and therefore did not enter Parliament either.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
In the view of Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, if it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India of the illegal collection of beetles, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations could occur.
This was emphasized by the New York minister after today's meeting with his Indian colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this doesn't work out, then surely it will come to a certain cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
After the talks, Mukherdshi said that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
In spite of everything, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from the charge and received a fine, the central government wanted with the local government in Darjiling, in whose case law the matter falls.
"His problem could be clarified," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of imprisonment, Mukherdshis believes it would be best if he were to go to appeal at a higher court.
He could ask for bail and wait in freedom for his sentence, says the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had just as expressed himself during the negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then there would be a pardon in question for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way that the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to offer "competent legal support" to the convicted, the Indian Minister pointed out.
At the same time, he said that such help would already be offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit this," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, he confirmed the importance of the Czech Republic in front of his partner.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
One answer to the question of whether he had received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter was from the minister.
"I have already been promised quite a lot," he simply stated.
A Czech overturns around the seabed
It arrives at an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosousso, who is part of the 30-member team of the UN Division for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His head, the divisional director, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it to and from.
Work and enthusiasm prevail here.
The seabed has so far been home to a little-known world rich in natural sources.
Oil is to be found here, in addition to ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also to date unknown living organisms, which bear, for example, the key to the development of a cancer medicine.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The neighbouring states today vehemently notified their claim to the new maritime areas.
According to a UN convention, they are making use of their rights, to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches a few hundred kilometres far from the shores of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simply expressed as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered to be a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It transcends the boundaries of the shoreline, often the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request made by the Member State concerned to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by an extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have had success," Mikulka adds.
A recent international echo was the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly enlarge its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, amounts to about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other countries will also be gradually submitting their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the Convention as "the common heritage of mankind".
There is then no state with a special position.
The right to promote in this area is granted to an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold graveland," says Mikulka, an exaggeration director, adding that "some areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It was given the status of a so-called "roadbreaking investor" by the 1991 Convention, as did the investors of a few other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"You can promote there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It reminds us of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the fantastic shem, which, according to legend, brought the Golem to life.
German specialists were at hostage liberation on site
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come into use.
In the circumstances of liberation eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are becoming more and more known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German specialists were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both specialists from the Bundeswehr and GSG 9 officials were the Fliegerstaffel der Bundespolizei, the Federal Criminal Office as well as logistics experts from the Technical Aid Agency at the site of the liberation.
However, as ministers’ spoke on Monday evenings reported, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government had accepted the assistance offered by Germany to engage it as support forces on the ground.
"Unfortunately it has not come to this," said a speaker from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The group of attackers kidnapped the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian, and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19th in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were dragged back and forth.
The identity of hostages remained unclear until the last time, as was the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The saviors have now arrived in Cairo well-kept.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not express any details of the release.
At first there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to the "image" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the specialists are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has barely failed the $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones got into the deep.
By 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority in favour of the programme to curb chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called for the agreement of Members, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or by 600 points.
There were concerns from investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure became known, fell again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizer records increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans' desire for travel remains unsettled in a study.
When booking for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the previous year's period, as reported by the Deutsche Reisverband (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK, the market research institute's survey shows that there are already increased book figures for the autumn months.
For example, the sales growth of travel agencies for October was about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
The basis for these results are figures from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and is highly calculated for the total market.
This includes travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, especially travel to the US was requested, the DRV reported.
Here, the increase in booking amounts to about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local communities of the Germans, were particularly sought after destinations.
In particular, vacation trips were high in the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs are "more predictable for the customer than for individually organised holidays".
Among other things, it could save consumers money through early-booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that there would be another increase in sales compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer made of liters and promises in designer dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television presenter and wears a tailor-made dindl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes on the meadow, the photographers fall on us and cut the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first meadow visit.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfil its purpose.
When Wiesn-Touri, and actually located north of the white stench, the feeling of well-being remained in the suit until that time.
But when you first arrive at the Theresienwiese, everything is half so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks face-to-face or embarrassingly touches - everything completely normal.
Strange views of the Schokobanan stand harvest only my dirndl spices.
A Munich woman draws my attention to the fact that I had wrongly bound the apron: "Lefts hoast frei, mid virgin, forgiven right, whistled behind."
I secretly frown the loop from back to left.
"Pass," said it and laughed.
Others make less effort to create subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch the naked back against an unbeloved one.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the October Festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn "oooooo".
He tells me that after he has escaped his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks he's a trasher.
So Bob's one of those infamous "Wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of the alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, nurses run in crowds over the festival square, which have to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the rudder - always four at a time drag a covered carry from tent to tent.
This works like with most Wiesn visitors: empty, full return.
You can't see who's under the plane in the promile sarg.
"These are the ones where goarnimmer pack," one of the paramedics called me on request and disappeared in the dust.
Name of victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female walker who died in the hospital after being driven by a vehicle in Essex was given.
Carole Paulson, residing at Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romeford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspicion that he was driving unintentionally.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey extends the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering deeply into Turkey's homeland.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial quest.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the tour guides tell you.
The building is mounted at the end of the railway platform with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is about to collapse
But once you're inside the curved ticket counter, there's no doubt about the grandeur of the project whose western access was that.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Gesellschaft.
Germany, which was a looter in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist plans paralyzed during World War I.
His rails were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable borders of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces withdrew from Egypt and forced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artistic roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly broken down, far passed from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a global new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian faction groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key dates of this new foreign policy, I climbed the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish Member of Parliament Suat Kiniglioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on track that produced the equanimity of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new global state project, to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish unity
This has caused some mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a specially designed, state-of-the-art stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a mid-right politician of almost every other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its homeland.
Today she has to look at the east and the west simultaneously.
There would not be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could at some point," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "will not have to take this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone with whom I spoke about here said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the transmitted sense, Europe as a whole can travel on that rail eastwards towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched this building build 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in Turkey's hands.
And when I was waiting for the ferry to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least there seemed to be no doubt about which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley (Nachruf on September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus the following year.
He was thought for teenagers until 21 years, but when the choir sang in 1979 for the last time, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any musical piece presented to it, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and consisted only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never left behind for years.
How often did death stop us from "let the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
Its manner of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never glorious, but never exuberant.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I have written about reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He abject conductors who, according to his words, simply "down with one or two well-known shepherds in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your follow-up to William Woodruff (25 September), you write that "he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman Research Grant in 1950 ... while studying at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a PhD degree.
This is a conclusion from an author's note in Woodruff's book "Jen Seits von Nab End", but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published in 1958 as "The British rubber industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 as part of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is unknown why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate, as they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows to find the magic moments."
Second round of excellent sale at Honda.
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large room limousine offers a much larger interior.
In addition, the technical subtleties that allow even more convenient driving and saving fuel are added.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made at this grand-limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the aim is to highlight the innovative design, the new spatial flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism.
However, before you start to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation has appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon affecting its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the release of jazz on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected figure is 10 000 cars, i.e. 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 jazz models since 2002, 6.7 % of its total sales to Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the release of the new Honda Jazz model makes it possible to cover up the downsizing of sales in Spain.
In reality, brand leaders hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22 000 models, which is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain (1.6%) to 1.8% compared to the previous year.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda relies on the emergence of a new model.
It's Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact 4.7-metre-long size, the Japanese company hopes to sell some 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remainder is distributed on the Old continent and Japan.
Insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimetres), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimetres) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it is 5 centimetres taller.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1,52 meters.
Together with increasing dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first-generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4-liter petrol engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk room with a 1.2-liter petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, apart from additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both versions have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 litres achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 min?1.
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, he now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`auto-biene' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan could be inspired this time by nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the oscillation of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the technical development center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own oval-shaped flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety sign.
But the most important thing is the facet eyes of the bee, which can see across an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows them to fly undisturbed in their personal airspace without interruption.
The technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF) to replicate the all-round perspective.
He notes obstacles that are located in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and are located in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a bordigen microprocessor, which is immediately translated into a signal for the prevention of collision
`At the moment that obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee fly and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to other arbitrary systems is that this avoidance manoeuvre takes place absolutely instinctively.
If not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, ' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither deviate upwards nor downwards; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and infinitely as the bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and braking functions, Nissan has used the rotation function to prevent collisions.
`This device only needs a couple of seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres performed, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology to introduce the Nissan into the series cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
A further possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite, in order to lead to the goal while driving, avoiding the obstacles on the way.
She's more of a shaker before being burdened with a mortgage.
One has to understand that the US Treasury has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, but is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid that the US citizens are involved in mortgage stories of supposedly payable banks, an entertaining and informative game for Internet surfers has been developed: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe the 'hotel of bad loans' or mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to consider one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And above all, where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but without details.
This is more a page for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen when the game is extended?
Well, if a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes her capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the start of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) in her company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a innovation that is due to a strong case of its exchange rate.
One week after a provisional agreement had been made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at a single price of 25.25 dollars, resulting in a total amount of three billion dollars.
The accepted price is below 19% of the price of the share of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure it a profit of 10% and can be resold at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be done on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, i.e., 28% above the current price value.
However, Morgan Stanley's share decreased by 6.79% to $23.07 against GMT 17.00.
`This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to a holding bank', said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley accepted this status last week, which is intended to enable him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Its connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan had simply declared that she would sell up to 20% of her shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
`A week ago', said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, `we thought that the participation would consist entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price MUFG will pay 7% below its price for their Morgan Stanley shares.
And the deal will go down by about 20% per share with a decrease in profit.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into common shares in one year, if the latter are exchanged within a given time limit to more than 50% above the sale value, i.e. to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the money delivered by MUFG will enable him to make use of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his sales.
However, a group press speaker refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance sheet has been `clear' since the end of August.
The last few weeks were hard for the group who had to look at how their stock exchange price dropped by half, while the price of insurance against incapacity for payment rose.
This price went down on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other `survivors' of the big investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Refound the Republic around the Socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
It was the third one who, following this Sunday, following the example of his like-minded and friends, elected the plan of a new constitution.
According to the 80% of voters, 64% of the voters voted 'yes'.
According to these results, 28% voted 'No', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were left empty.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, more than half of the votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls and a census of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for 'Yes' at the polls, 63% to 70% prophesy.
By the way, on the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The `constitution has triumphantly triumphed', he had insured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometres southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, held in silence in accordance with the American Organization of Organizations (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives to the greatest extent possible from oil production by foreign companies and foreign exchange, to send the displaced to the country.
The project, which is being promoted by Correa elected in 2006, also grants the Head of State greater power, which will be able to exercise up to two successive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce into this country 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
In the end, it also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will bring an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as the starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who were captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were brought back this Monday afternoon healthy and unharmed to the Egyptian capital.
In the morning they had been freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base al-Maza directly next to Cairo International Airport at around 3:30 p.m. on board a special plane.
They were taken directly to Maadi Hospital, an alien district of Cairo, on board a helicopter without being able to speak to the press to be investigated there.
They were all "best health" and the kidnappers were not paid a ransom," said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the roll field.
After she was captured at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya on September 19th, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from a hiding place by 35 unknown kidnappers.
These are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, one border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer stated that 30 members of the special units, on board two helicopters, launched the attack at night shortly before dawn.
`On both sides, shots fell, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said this responsible person, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commanders.
The head of Italian diplomats Franco Frattini told of Belgrade, where he is right now, about the role that secret agents and elements of the Italian special units have played.
`We must acknowledge that thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men, we have achieved this result from the intelligence services and from the special units,' he explained without further details.
He also argued that a ransom had been paid.
The night before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a field vehicle with a patrol in which the kidnappers were, of whom they killed six, including the leaders from Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were in connection with a rebel group from Darfur, the movement Libération du Sudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, immediately contested this movement.
letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is a key issue of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But an area of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the miserable sums that are granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historic places that are starving?
What politician will dare remind the Federal Government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing EUR 3.5 million only for the restoration of the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, by all members of parliament and by mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 historical societies strive to deal intensively with history, save the numerous private archives with a few large ones, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments state parts of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries want to take advantage of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been hit by the US financial crisis, with partial nationalisation: the three countries provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's Competition Authority representative.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the Bank could be precedentd.
In line with the decision made on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell part of its holdings, especially the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis started a steep valley trip last week, and in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios have already been distinguished.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too large for a fraud.
The securities of the institute fell by 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the Group's market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic according to the management.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion in expensive American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty on the markets is due to the valley of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the Bank's new Director-General.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interested party with a factual offer.
The Belgian government was, however, trying to calm down - no investor should shake for his money, it was called.
There has so far been no panic among the customers, the branches of the bank have not been disturbed.
In Hungary, Fortis has its own branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fuchs in the chicken stable
Because of a person's drug use, life and health insurance in America often refuses to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data to the consent of the data subject in any case.
These should be in an independent hand, otherwise we trust the fox to the chickens" - quoted the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance sets the fees and the payment in the event of damages depending on the health of the customer, and should the risk be overrated, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was only concluded in knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: Using the customer's identification number, he collects the data from the pharmacies for the last one and a half years, saying which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from what disease the customer suffers from and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol reducing drugs, it would be obvious that his blood fat level is untreatable, which would automatically bring him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be used for various purposes, such as for migraines and heat shields, but also for depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the Insurers' point of view, while the above ones are not.
For the query and processing of the data, own companies have formed which, before they obtain the data, ask the patient for his consent.
Meanwhile, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been made.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and connect them with the data on drug consumption, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a health data protection law of its own, its effect only extends to health service providers and insurance companies.
The draft law has already been presented to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realises that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the data subject may hardly be able to prohibit access to his or her data, as otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him or her.
And so the chickens are left to some sort of grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both leading trading partners of each other, this was the main theme in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit also takes place, where the main debate is on cooperation in the nuclear sector.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic power that should be given more votes and participation in international affairs, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase it to around EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this target is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that air transport will continue to be air transport.
By 2009, India would like to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to achieve a balance in the currently unbalanced EU-India relationship: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only nine among the EU's partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as the terrorism that both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also under way.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides blameed for failure.
The EU stressed that it is committed to its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India, along with the proposal to reach a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050, also agreed to this.
Food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement at a bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, however, orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion are expected for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be adopted at 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for rights acquisition.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects to host the current event of over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will distribute over 171.790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour of the event.
The Under-Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented at the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia".
A press conference near the room structure in exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair will follow this. On this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is reduced throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
Found back the billionaire Steve Fossett's small plane, which disappeared a year ago
Steve Fossett's small plane, a billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, was discovered on a flight over the Nevada desert.
The parts were found on a plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely dispels the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been localized and sent out a force. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the aircraft or its vicinity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (Ntsb) noted that a crew was sent out a few hours after the aircraft was sighted, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett started a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, also in California, near the border to Nevada, some of Fossett's personal items were found by a couple near their home on the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two cards with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned one month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history through a long sequence of records.
In 2002, in the sixth run, he was the first man to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later he circled the world in a single flight without a landing by plane.
Among his numerous records is also an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv, which falls out of the conventional scheme through its original design and special lines, the exhausting surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz tried to breathe new breath into the sector with this off-roader.
Due to its exceptional properties, the performance of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be on display in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from 17th October.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, to be carried out in various phases, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, by 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear as a three-dimensional model in its almost real dimensions.
Indeed, the car will appear so apparent from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details in different moments, in order to assemble again as a whole.
Without a doubt, it is Mercedes's concern to introduce a new type of author's complaint into this rather stereotyped field with this advertising.
But will it be possible to attract the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been travelling behind the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The sponsors come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These included other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militias appear: however, they were removed on Saturday in order to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria it came to a collision with a truly radical right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
Of the Figc, 144 cards had been made available to the Italian fans for the game: all had been issued on name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal as well: no one was on the way to Sofia with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Thank God.
But now, of course, there is fear of counterfeiters, who could follow these little more than 150.
"This fire must be immediately removed, and that will in no case give such behaviour the opportunity to justify it," it says from the Viminal.
Therefore, "Especially looking at the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, in Apulia there is a small core of the Italian ultras.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sports) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium force.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (explained without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of the Ultras Italia founded in 2002.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duke, but without a doubt the conduct of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist – add the number 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are committed in the country of their act.
So far, this group had been holding its feet, but now it has to be reconsidered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the whistles during the anthem Mamelis: even though this is not a crime, but allow them for me, there is no education ...".
