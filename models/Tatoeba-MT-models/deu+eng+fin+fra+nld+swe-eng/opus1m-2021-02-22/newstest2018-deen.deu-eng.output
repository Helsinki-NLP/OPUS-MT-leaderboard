Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city
Irrespective of where young people are supposed to meet today.
A pit chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now buried.
Small gardeners run the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying if maps aren't up to date.
Everyone who had to get excited about this is aware of this because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas, an offer from the state government's Geoportal Bayern, are anything but current - but that is precisely why they are very revealing.
Especially when comparing them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the distribution area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a flicker that you don't recognize as such.
For cities and municipalities more detailed maps, so-called origin sheets, were included in the large overview map.
According to the Bavarian Measurements Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from Bavaria's first measurement.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria in the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wished to have an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bayern map.
Elector Max IV Joseph continued to drive the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Survey Administration.
The original sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison Early/Today is most impressive on the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The Untersendlings houses are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered hallways from the so-called "source" from which the basic tax was derived.
Small plots no longer prove farmers there today - but small gardens of the plant "Land in Sun".
A large green area is distinguished north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the venue of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete waste.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original paper you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the top "On the air" in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people were once locked up with delusions.
There, in 1858/59, the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the axe of the so-called fools.
In addition, he has prohibited the use of force against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has been involved in an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients there had been space at first, and later 500 more places had been added.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular iron plant in Haar 1905.
Since 2006 there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments.
West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, eastern houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the Children's House "Casa Don Bosco" was built, inspired by the original building of the Irrenassanto, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in the case of bombings.
The Marienplatz was listed as the "Main Square" in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change brought the Second World War into the heart of Munich.
The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
A great one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a cave chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work was done and on 5 April 2017 the sparrowing for the second S-Bahn line was carried out.
With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial picture of today - and fill up the hole at Marienhof.
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People has issued a warning to colored people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls upon African-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention to travel through the state and to exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the Group's opinion says.
A recently adopted piece of Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination charges, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state, which are disproportionate towards minorities, prompted the group to release the travel warning, said NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten together or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during his trip through the state and was arrested by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Attorney General's Office of Missouri showing that black drivers in the state are stopped more often than whites 75 percent.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and that their families, friends and employees are informed about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared to bring bail or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program that rank the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Freedoms Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, following the adoption by states of immigration laws, requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration offences, which, in the view of ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have introduced the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidemann project is elemental
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.
The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac obtained an image on site.
At the legal graveyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU-Ortsverband met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.
Markus Schwedemann first gave insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and housed holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Schwarzwaldmilch" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaun project "essentially important".
I cannot make any profit in such steep areas.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, much work had to be done with the motor sensor.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," stressed Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parenting plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a bio-plant.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the Leader funding".
At a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this will allow the reforestation of the areas to be pulled out for a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on operating," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised for their support.
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced through the pasture funding.
The surface area of the site is 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71 500 euros, half were funded through Leader, one quarter by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of pasture.
"The great advantage is the longevity of fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it's not possible".
Peter Weiß also said: "Best foods are produced here".
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) in Baden-Württemberg enables the state to promote pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The presence of a promotional backdrop as defined by the LPR is a prerequisite.
In addition, the fenced area must not be less manageable (more than 35%) and must therefore be threatened by the foresting.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently being submitted by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The area of open space corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump adopts the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key ideologists, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN's Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Freedom.
To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lied to him if he had.
But he seized their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base.
When Miller Acosta denounced, "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was later added and is not part of the original statue of freedom."
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance on the disturbing words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your distressed masses, who long to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "leap waste" could be seen better on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump's USA are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who were committed to placing their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were doing a high-political act.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical image.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of Exilants.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativeism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the statue of freedom does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the night-old world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States."
It's pretty unusual that Limbaugh hit something here.
The significance of the statue is quite a question of perception.
The great fantastic act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And of course that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to recognize.
Their torch shall not light the way, but the hatred which is their only source of power.
2017 World Championship: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team
Neil Black, the performance director of athletics of the United Kingdom, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship framework "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special in Scotland" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will carry it on until we find out," said Black.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m course, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team as team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or wherever they were living or training, left the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally was great."
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete at the 400 m World Championships at their fifth World Championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship so far was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The medium-distance runner Muir is heading this way and has set five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another shot you should watch after a great season, which included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers their first world championships when the only other shooter in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "very proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also participate in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to go up on podiums.
What about my speech as Captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just mentioned that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a home-world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics via Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
I'm sure he was a critic.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said: "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb and mute, we are led to slaughter like the sheep."
This takes me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Freedoms Union sued him for that at the beginning of this week.
The staff of the Governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict respect for the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his constituents and playing to debut his hairless head for chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the Governor's side - who is a public forum that is officially called and of employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chase, defended the Governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, M.D., was not full of hate, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comment section of the "The Post" news broadcast.
"I don't like this idea, either, if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the Governor's employees described as "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "intercession".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if you had done the same thing, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of Loudoun County's board of supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous correspondents struck his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
According to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project, petitions that criticised his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overcame his office.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort in the next three days, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian is organizing the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led left next door to Archerfield until the final round last year, before losing against Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how it reaches its glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from its best side, it is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job fixing this place.
He is a zealous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels special," said Southport-based player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the program in the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year here.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action at home.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to make it good, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I am glad how it went so far."
With the trio in the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are in the team.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, the car park costs £ 5 per car with one occupant and £ 10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer deaths from passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from passive smoking of lung cancer.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this result in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he started his own study on this subject of 1994.
At that time there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in the Villener Straße are in full swing and "are in some way in time", says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of home connections, the situation was more complicated than expected, as much is hidden in the underground, which was not included in the plans.
The traffic, which constantly hinders construction work, poses a major problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of the motorists in front of red traffic lights and parking grids is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road was closed and only the buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But luckily, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the chilled clove is removed and swallowed with eggy, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing clothes with turbid water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 pm," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders should vote for the occupation troops by means of a public survey.
An existing movement of independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5 hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated roofs converted by rust into various yellow brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuan honored a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively hand woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"In the past, we had only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a state-of-the-art province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has mined 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper.
Papua also has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papua, which ensures that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a stifling presence.
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gooses and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua Tribal Highland in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" is said in a 2016 report of the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which contains reports of the horrors of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia's Human Rights Watch researcher.
The screws have increased, as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic change is taking place because Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan warning canteens sell fried chicken and Gado Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people fight to stay here.
"The migrants have begun selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to Jayapura provincial capital.
"It cost the local Papua - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokovi in the Volksmund, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address inequalities and violations of law in Papua.
The former roomman secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on their way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered only two months after Jokowis' inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The scared children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers attacked her tone and later returned with four soldiers, said the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who drank hunted and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - in circle and imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago-Stamm.
Some protesters started to throw stones at police and military stations.
When the mood was heated, an order was sent to the soldier via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," it says in an official document of TIME that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto-Viertel of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I suddenly got shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was met three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to be sure he was," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only wears a name that TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because they were being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, spokesman for Papua Police in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only the following day.
Three weeks Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately, so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an extra-judicial mechanism to deal with historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke with TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of "crime against humanity", who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's 1999 bloody independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims opposed such claims with terrible infidelity.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shooters didn't stop.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there'll be revenge," says Dominggu Badii, 29-year-old, who lives near the hospital and was a witness of the rapid delivery of the injured, says TIME.
"I've been hiding for two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to be held accountable and the police mobile brigade to withdraw from the area.
Paniai was always a disturbance for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend Papua's rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders came from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years, under the pretext of "security of national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here are building everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants, who have reached the Nabire Airport in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better-educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to run its own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribe Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media reporting remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokovis' promises to lift reporting restrictions in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report about Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and Western Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group's accusations and said to journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited on 4 May, locals broke their silence and harassed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a human being who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "school" that he must pay back.
"You don't need money, you just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site opposite the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time
A fire found its way through on Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high 79-storey building.
It's the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise in just two years, which you randomly call the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the people's screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who named his name George Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection agencies said that the fire fighting units at 4:00 local time (00.00 GMT) wiped out the fire and cooled down the building.
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rises around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage came from cladding, exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cladding on the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis-Cup-Reform: Next Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) attended the General Assembly with his large Davis Cup Cup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup-single only on two winnings was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but which is also very much appreciated, are therefore still preserved for the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was just missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," Haggerty said.
Efforts will continue to be made to improve applications.
After many objections, it was not until the vote that the proposal was put to the vote that the finale should be held in a neutral place.
New in 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: In the following year, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be simplified and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 U.S. travellers bring prohibited items into the plane, find out a survey
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent of prohibited items were smuggled past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft while carrying accidentally prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had gone wrong with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a Jet Charter Service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers are more than in breach of the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7% were Millennials, compared to less than 15% who were members of the generation X.
The most common objects that were deliberately fermented to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted that they were knowingly carrying objects with blades through security controls, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought prohibited drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it had asked travellers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods through airport security and how many it would have deliberately done.
It is no surprise that the people most likely to wear smuggled goods - knowingly or ignorantly - were the ones who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA Directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain about which liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
It is no surprise, therefore, that the largest quantity of liquids seized by the TSA are prohibited.
For a while, people thought TSA could consider books as smuggled goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
So far, he has failed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumptive figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla Chief Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less glossy number in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often launched the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months, the delivery of which is just starting.
Now Musk admits: Of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will refund the 1000 Euro (in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "reservation deposit".
Currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations are available, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could be a problem so far.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 it is supposed to be - all models combined - 500,000, 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production roads that have never been tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from walking away in crowds.
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws due to delaying the rules of Obama Era to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog-induced air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than to previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is a deadline for states to comply with the 2015 ground-level ozone standards on 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interference in local decisions or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt, who was President Donald Trump's prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations which the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal court of appeal in Washington decided that the EPO administrator exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his turnaround on ozone standards simply reinforce the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waits for it to be prosecuted by groups of activists and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who accused the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority that exists to us."
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt would at some point use its "property for delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "are based on sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that had sued the EPO this week, said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The conversion of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is produced when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered at the surprising change in course of Pruitt's course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step of the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crucifixion of the Trump government, to offer ourselves to environmental pollution and its special interests".
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Mountain Church, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 pm.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in Tumlingen has made the friends and promoters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini stresses: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergian book of documents: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Master Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
The text of the document on the Tumlinger Berg, apart from the former parish church, also stood a dominant court, to which the church or the right of patronage belonged and not vice versa.
So there were people there too.
As can be seen from the description of the town of Freudenstadt in 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the dominant settlement center of the village.
Old maps of the time around 1600 support these historical realities.
The right of patronage came from the early Middle Ages right of own church.
A Lord who built, equipped and occupied a church remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
This meant the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two fell on Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell was first played in 1692, but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942.
During the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the windows were struck and the cords were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796 French troops stored near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilarius Church was abolished.
Only the church tower was left.
On New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half fell.
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken.
Only today's tower moose was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Pensionnern" as successor to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As organisers, Tumlingen's friends and sponsors invite them to the old cemetery at the sixth Serenade on Sunday, July 16th to the St. Hilariuskapelle.
This is designed by the combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
President Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Entry is from 3.30 p.m.
For the sound of the Serenade, a turret takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers present the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organisers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and promoters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to check approval of wind turbines
"Boisheim defends itself" does not see any legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its authorisation for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was wrongly done.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved at all, since at that time only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind energy concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan, the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a formal error.
"Because of the lack of a legal condition for planning, the approval decision issued remains illegal and therefore also withdraws," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim is opposed".
Current state of affairs: The City Council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; approval by the district government is still outstanding.
Erkens: "This means that approval for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law at this point".
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received at the district of Viersen since last week," one speaker explained.
The circle takes them on the occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to stop the procedure.
With a view to ongoing proceedings before the Administrative Court, on Thursday the circle did not wish to comment on the argument of the association "Boisheim defends itself".
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans the construction of four 200 meter high wind wheels on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
The four wind turbines are designed to cover the electricity needs of around 11,400 households - which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest about 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Car and tractor crack together: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The state road remained locked for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich, with her car, travelled with her 53-year-old mother to Bogel as a companion.
City and dealer plan home shopping weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to re-discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The commercial association and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th September to lure the inhabitants to the shopping mall in the city centre.
As Christian König, chairman of the trade association, announced, the "home shopping" weekend is supposed to raise customers' awareness of what offers their own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket goods.
According to this plan, a market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, shops in the city centre are to be invited to "Midnight Shopping".
The aim of the project is not only to target the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation were commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, says Christian König.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
In this way, the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive Downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" at the Brunnenfest as well as a sale-open Sunday, talks with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or re-opened.
These include visitors and tourists.
But even many locals would have lost sight of shopping downtown.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city centre - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome with a network the lethargy, which had partly spread, King had said in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, said that five cities in Thuringia were taking part for the first time on the third "home shopping" day in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote for the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis two people have been killed and nine others injured, some of them hard.
According to the fire department on Wednesday (local time) another injured person was in critical condition.
A man died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A missing person was also buried later.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of disaster, the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put pressure on Mexico to pay the border walls after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump, in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, called to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US President denounced him because he publicly denounced the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and swore to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull said that a trade for the United States of America who emigrated to Australia would be "male", "mies" and "stupid", and that the existence of the trade that was arranged by the Obama government would make him look like a "depp" after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford-Massaker: Activists resurrect racist Lynchakt as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and rolled to the Ford Bridge in Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block their way.
The leader of the Mob - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n ----r Roger!" the man shouted.
"Get him out of the car!"
Scream tore the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is only a replica.
But when a loop is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience came out with very real sighs.
Since 2005, citizens' lawyers have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to mark the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were shot by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with murder.
"It's really incomprehensible that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in organizing the replica.
"It's a dirt stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime citizen.
For him, the reproduction serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A medical examiner places a bedcloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford lynx on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have remained on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions was always known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens of Georgia to cast their votes for the first time at the pre-election campaign in summer.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, Roger Malcom, a white landowner, Barnett Hester, fell down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying didn't come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, says the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they left the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murder," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks says it's even more concise.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual replacement of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.
Their representation is vivid, pervasive and is based on a kind of deep racism that many people want to believe does not exist in America anymore.
It's hard to look around and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynchen because then we'll all be confronted with its uglyness in us," she said.
"But I can't make a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the blacks - pressed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has been playing the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play starts with Malcom, who screams at Hester and harasses him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona answers the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
"What?", Rascona asked.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still whining.
"I just don't think white people said 'n --- he' back then."
"But," joked one of the other black actors.
"You just have to meet the hard "R."
And right there, the energy in the room shifts, a sense of comradeship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharp and emphatically.
Absolutely no one's laughing.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a grieving dress, stands over the actors' bodies and carries out Billie Holidays' grieving lobrede "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple have come from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have all experienced the pressing moisture of Georgia for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels spensive.
When the last notes of the song reach out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the bodies.
Children cling to their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mumbles like he wants to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynch rope and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then weeps together in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatting about the replica with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the feeling of the performance.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the Lynchen is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room Tyrone Brooks court holds on to his table, he eats and reminds of the civil rights.
He said he's already started planning the performance next year.
"The reproduction is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's so if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his or her own story, who does not know his or her own story, is doomed to repeat it."
"Godning" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts a colorful frivolous stage in front of a gigantic six-story backdrop.
The rotating stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shaky street corner with mural remains and Donerbude in Berlin, a "plast and elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes old timer park, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rockers, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which is drawn by his "ring" production.
The three Rheintöchters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduced Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), dragged a body into the trunk in Hollywood-Manier and gave the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the magnificently rotten Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavy boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beat Siegfried.
Later on, Gunther (Markus Oake) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who modestly bows his hands to the Merkel rail, are celebrated in a stormy way.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows up on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual casual clothes.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was highly anticipated.
If he had had to have a great peif concert over him in 2013, there was a great cheer five years later, in which the isolated "buh"-rufes went under.
Festival manager Katharina Wagner may have enjoyed it.
"You can see that the audience has grown up with the "ring" in a way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of its view.
I'm drawing a positive conclusion.
Max Volume works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where are we everywhere?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school all day open.
How are your experiences with it?
Lots: It's a nice, wide spectrum I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're now 26 years old, a late-time volunteer.
How's that coming?
Lots: I've done abiturage.
And then a civil engineering study, let's say, successfully discontinued.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on site, in the focus maybe, really.
And was it like that?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I'll start my studies in social services in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, probably do a social worker training at Herne Youth Office, and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you make your FSJ.
One can make it from the old age home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partially in the Ogs, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike engineering?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statistics.
There are always other people in the shape of their heads, each with a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to take care of it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of touching?
Lots: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that has a lot to offer.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson cuts further 3,000 jobs and reduces the dividend to revive the business
On Friday, the British Pearson Education Group said it would reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate divisions by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure the company was facing.
The downsizing, which Director-General John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, is in addition to his previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost reduction program a cost reduction plan of another 300 million pounds ($394 million) to revive a business that was made the quick step towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year had remained unchanged, having achieved an increase of 1 percent to GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, reported a statement by NATO.
According to unsubstantiated local reports, three civilians died during the incident in Qarabagh district.
Bombardment is the last act of violence that Afghanistan has committed this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, the explosion happened on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised set of persons".
The statement states that all injured persons are in stable condition and are treated in the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths, some 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31st, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since the US-led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPO returns to the decision to delay the smog rule after actions have been brought to:
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay regulation of Obama's government, which requires states to limit Smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states charged the Agency with the action.
The EPO announced late Wednesday the decision to push forward the so-called "Ozon 2015 provisions" and said it showed the Agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue and in our response to our state partners," said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced the intention of the EPO to delay one year by October 2018, in order to determine where cuts must be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards for ozone emissions in some parts of the country.
A group of 15 most democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
President Trump's government has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental demands imposed by former President Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth according to Trump.
However, efforts have resulted in the withdrawal of democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that inhaling air, the ozone contains "may reduce lung function and enhance respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Municipal council wants a common space
In the end, the decision was clear: the Fluorn-Winzeln Municipal Council decided on the establishment of a Community area in the future old-age housing complex by two votes against.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing property was signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time for the area of the church municipality to be owned, there is no longer any planning obstacle to the project to be approved by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a Community area for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters at a special price.
The administration, and the majority of the municipal council, suggests that such a common space should not only be a meeting place for residents of the rightful residence, but should be open to the community.
The word "Strickcafé" was used as an example.
The decision, which has already been taken in the autumn, to allocate funds to the current budget, will be welcomed by means of funding possibilities.
The building is located in the rehabilitation area.
According to Tjaden, the establishment of a Community area would be eligible for support by 60% of the total.
The proposal for a decision aims to signal to the investor that in this respect they do not want to throw a button between the legs, the conclusion that both saddle - which is inspired by the environment - and pulse roof - which reduces grape height and makes construction possible - would be possible.
Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer, is this addition.
If it helps, he will act unanimously.
It's not that simple. It's the common space.
Daniela's reputation refers to the many buildings of her own, with which you don't get right ahead, for which you now refuse to go out of the window in the common room, she says, "I'm doing hard with it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community - but absolutely against community participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to any wealthier or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because with the acquisition of the land you do not grant a grant, but get a real marketable equivalent, in case of doubt, is the opposite.
Mr Staiger's request to split up the proposal for a decision accordingly was supported by three.
So it remains with two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes: "If we take the decision like that, we are making a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision by car: Wheelers are thrown on the road
During the crossing of the road, a 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
As the police reported, 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the road from Hilden with his bike on the road to the Black Road.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the top of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver heading in the same direction gave him priority.
However, when the long field was on the road, it apparently did not pay attention to the counter-traffic.
He met with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hilden woman.
The man was thrown on the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a refuelling van.
FC Bayern Munich must give up David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game go against Dortmund.
FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first time in the season.
Seven pros are missing from the title defenseman in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
Before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 a.m./ZDF and Eurosport), the staff of German football record champion Bayern Munich is getting bigger and bigger with Cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti has to give up David Alaba in duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
In addition, Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing from Munich.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team responsible.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said and added: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
That wasn't good at last."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team is showing these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights draws the fans into their ban.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walk from star to star in the resin
In the resin, the first "star trail" is to be created throughout Germany.
This is planned by the club Observatory Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" met the information needs of many hard-working visitors, it was said.
It connects nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "accessible installations in five to six locations" in the upper resin.
In question are St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented by internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Trail will be extended by train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of valuable knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars had different colors or why one star shines brighter than another, although it lay much further away.
It is also suggested in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best seen.
The club has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda-Galaxia can be seen clearly from there with the naked eye.
Since 2003 there has been something similar to the planned Sternenwerg - the planet path, on the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet path leads with its stars up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (Municipal Similars) with the planet Sedna.
The stars with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are set exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6,5 millimetres diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planet's path is about four kilometres.
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the Stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fix star would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Superweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for- Pound list.
Garcia stretched her right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomänenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former spring weight," Garcia reminded.
"I got up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down on lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode, because all fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later expressed herself openly to fight in the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ..."
Garcia said he estimated Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and he might be participating in his Saturday campaign.
But Lomachenko stopped by the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the triangulation champion from Riverside "very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey...you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said the focus was to show punch, then box.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomacheko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured after tyre placers
In the event of an accident on the A7 four people were partially seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the marketplace.
The car slipped to the right into the blast, where it was overturned and then lying on the roof in the green stripe.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the first delivery of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked towards the north for about an hour, and then the traffic could be passed on the left lane at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Treier Chain Works Better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 season start against Braunschweig that the optimization of defense formation will bring points in Aue.
With the first season game Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, the two counter-gates would not have been against Braunschweig at 2:2.
"These were two countergates too much, and we have to watch out even better in Aue," says Fortuna Düsseldorf's defense player.
In the Erzgebirge, the three-ring chain is to be further optimised.
And a goal after a free shot, the fortunes don't want to catch up.
"For the future, no one will stand on the line besides Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the preparation with the three-chain than with the four-chain, even after the experience.
"I don't know how we're going to operate in Aue," said his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players who can build well in the three-ring chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, but that we harmonize even better and we do not make so many playoffs in the building."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a failed start after a decision is made, you don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand there on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight days of playing," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage to Aue, just because the Saxony game in Heidenheim had to be interrupted prematurely because of an storm.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, since they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favourite in the bone.
"But they don't know where they stand at the moment," says Fortuna's Internal Defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as an easy favourite on Sunday to meet at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we wipe them out, just because we have the claim to come under the first six, is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance sheet is quite positive in only a defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which you have to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna's chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New Results of the Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Scientific Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty-eight percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "is possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests shall be carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been constant in recent months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are quite constant," he said to The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the applicant has lied about his or her age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "propose that the person being examined is 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that he would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, during which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee tips are made, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went sooner or later than usual through puberty.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't act as if we could," he said to Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of judgment a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section on the bridge was installed at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's great," says Reinhold Leicht, head of the road and transport department in the Fribourg government bureau.
In April the works started simultaneously on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to make sure that the schedule is met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over Trombach.
It is a arched concrete bridge, which is clad with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come to an end.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red Buntsandstein.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, respectively 10,60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a so-called bridge cap 1.30 metres wide and seven tons heavy on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is a margin fixation that is also used as an operating path.
On Friday, a bridge cap of 2.20 metres will be installed on the southern part of the bridge.
Then the walker's path should go.
The particular thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of Schramberger company Dizzo.
The other two bridges have already been patented.
A special feeling of touch has required the laying of wires through the building in Lauterbach.
There is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by hand-printing.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building of the building and the collector towards Schramberg the traffic is regulated by a traffic light one-way.
The road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed for construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher local entrance.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is 700 000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest with German potato salad
It doesn't happen so often that parties pull a strand, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to take care of.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) represented in the district day Vulkaneifel are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on that day, because the AfD in the Gerolstein City Hall Rondell invites to the "great election start" according to the poster.
And well-known names are starting - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already hours before the event starts on site do not want to listen to the AfD students, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the well square, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that offers itself there.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forums One world and one of the leading organizers, is really happy: "How many people have come together here."
There is music and lots of food, including a "urdeutscheer potato salad, which the AfD could also eat without problems", says the woman who brought him.
The police ordered a lot of officers to Gerolstein, showing presence especially at the station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.
How did the AfD come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he had tried such an event and got the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but received a rejection because, because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes, there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
In view of the event on the Rondell vantage point he says: "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
This is also the case: Around 8 p.m. on the Rondellvorplatz a band provides entertainment, in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the Rhine-Palatinateian AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour takes the AfD event, the guests in the courtyard have a longer breath, but also there is just after 21 o'clock the clean up is announced.
The police can break down - no special incidents.
Trombone meets Trumpete
A hearing with the Wolfacher trosauist Frederic Belli will take place in the Haslach monastery concert series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Schwarzmeer meets Black Forest", or even "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German education with roots in bubble music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchester Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to exceed the limits of their instruments, but also to merge the limits of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds with the two as in a new dress, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "exchange suite" of the jazz echo award winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play mix into a fascinating total work of art.
This core of the programme was first performed in Freiburg this spring with enormous success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," Kristen Stewart openly says about her bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what comes next?"."
The Hollywood Star's most famous relationship was with her "twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who finally broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and believed it seriously.
So I've never been confused or bothered.
I just never liked being taken seriously."
Especially among them she suffered according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was 11, the kids told me I'd look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, ' Girl, be proud of you!'."
Especially to the public, they do not like to explain their love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself to the whole public."
Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I'm going to tell you with a lot of prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I'm going to tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you if I'm a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in cheer.
"I will change my registration to the Republicans tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement earlier at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes finds that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening in which it said: "The change of party of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and the control of the few legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from above to below and unable to find a positive, unifying message," NRC President Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honor" Russian apology for doping scandal
The world leader in athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia as a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be taken back into sports.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the athletics world championships that his country's ban was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were taken away from gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found indications of state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized with itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "rejoiced" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to use Russia again," Coe said.
"We have to do everything in our power to normalize this situation in the coming months.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will appear as neutral players in the athletics World Championships, which start on Friday in London, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for resetting.
Drug testing was still insufficient and prohibited trainers were still free to work, he said reporters in London after a speech to the IAAF Council.
Obituary for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral celebration in Fritzlar, North Hessian, around 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
The Minister of Defence, Ursula von der Leyen (CDU), said nothing about the yet unexplained cause of the crash.
However, she described the two dead pilots as "the master of her profession".
"We are dissipating ourselves from the highest sacrifice they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Staff-Capital from Nordhessen died in Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and taken to the Fritzlar Cathedral of St. Peter with a dead guard from the Bundeswehr on Thursday.
At noon, only the members of the church said goodbye.
Then the funeral began in the circle of the family, close friends, of representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as of politics.
Among these were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Obituaries laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defence of the Leyen described the deceased soldiers as "highly decorated" and deployed.
The Chief of Staff had built up the flight operations of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Also Volker Bauersach, commander of the regiment, to whom the soldiers belong, declared: "If this crew could not turn the crash away, then no one could have done so."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of Leyen: The use is dangerous.
But it was also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral the särges were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they were buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not intend to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was reported by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agrees with her husband's decision, it was further stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, be unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his French home country.
Prince Henrik had never made a cry that he was not happy with his title.
After the throne ascent of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to be king.
He retired in 2016 and also plays the title "Prinzgemahl".
Because Henrik in Denmark did not have the title and function he wanted, he did not regard himself as equal to his wife - not even after the death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house, explained.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will be finally, be still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his French home country, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for over the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French nobles, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked in the French Embassy at Themse.
During his later wife's ever-flying sympathies with the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gaulese, which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals in this country, I could not hope for tolerance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
These were two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is for a rapid re-election of the Landtag after the loss of the red and green majority of government, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday the House voted in favour of the resolution.
Previously, the surprising withdrawal of a Green member from her parliament in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag election, the Red-Green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green MP Elke Twesten justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
CDU Group leader Björn Thumler wants to recommend that his group include them.
Together, CDU and FDP had 69 seats in Lower Saxony, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the ratio has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on January 14th next year.
Thumler said that the Red-Green government must now decide whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the Landtag decide its own resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landtag will withdraw the Prime Minister's trust and choose a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be reviewed legally," said Thumler.
"You will discuss all questions in peace, if they are legally reasonable."
Thumler called Twesten's step "but something curious."
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good".
She called herself a follower of black and green.
The Greens called on the apostate Members to return to their Parliamentary mandate.
"Of course, we assume that they will give back their Landtag mandate, which they have received through the green country list, with immediate effect," said the country presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The Group president of the Greens Anja Piel said: "We deeply regret the decision of Elke Twesten".
She has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even in the context that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
The SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transition of the Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of Red-Green," wrote the Federal Manager of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elected the Landtag.
The withdrawal of Twestens costs Red-Green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician denounced the SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil, "in her hurt vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the well-being of the country."
"It is a scandal that the CDU participates in this dirty intrigue game in Lower Saxony and tries to beat political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU group leader Björn Thumler wants to recommend to his MPs that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU.
The SPD Group leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, suggested that Twesten falsify the result of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoners, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers be protected?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) to speak and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.food warning.de, the Federal States provide the latest information on the eggs in question.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we know at the moment, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the informant is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has opened up immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since becoming aware of Germany's concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe.
If the maximum residue level of 0,005mg/kg is exceeded for eggs, these shall not be capable of transport.
Unladen eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
This time the companies are not guilty.
Do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat?
According to the current knowledge, the production plants are not directly responsible.
Rather, they must expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in serious cases.
Is there only a lack of staff or a lack of coherent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded by 100 percent.
This is precisely why a consistent explanation of such events and the handing over to the prosecutors in cases where offences may exist are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide full information.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly indignant.
Due to the armored means manufacturers, dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in food delivery is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the situation quickly and in complete.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditure by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules that were established by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly ease the money so that Neymar sign it and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but have to counter-tax with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break-even in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively betrayed and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from focusing on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential and then strongly invested to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP funding period, which runs until 2018, Clubs can face losses of EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015 in disdain, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to strive to deter excessive spending.
"Of course, FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the amount of the proceeds for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million can be declared in the financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, has met with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to overlist their financial supervision by bloating their revenues by companies connected with the owners of a club.
While a cataristic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments from the Organisational Committee of the World Cup 2022.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a manoeuvre could be easy for UEFA regulators to find out.
Previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity because they were not entitled to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with sales of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year still need to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandise and jersey sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymar's escape by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservation of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It's the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country owns an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fairness because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier
In recent years Chocolate Frey has produced on-board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation stands before a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request from the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" from Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," said the speaker.
About 17 million small red and white placards per year distribute the flight attendants to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Sector insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to CHF 1.5 million to 2 million - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: For a Schoggi manufacturer it is a prestigious task.
How many candidates there are in the new tender, the Swiss does not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers come into question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey aims to renew the contract beyond Spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for an opinion.
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate tables on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut and Hug had delivered the chocolate tablets.
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, customers of the First Class will be spoiled with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class check passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolate Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed by Chocolate Frey on the short course, both in business and in the Economy Class.
Athletics - Diskus-Olympiawinner Robert Harting reaches the World Cup finals
The three-time World Champion fights for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic winner of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup ruling and could only look at the discus competition from the Tribune.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgia goes to the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-year-old grunge era (when the forethinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is also a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humors (it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stepping on the core of the gag - actors of middle-aged play horny children who grow up - they nevertheless managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting-can principle, including a reef on the Stalker movies of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that swings the cradle").
At one point, a character beats through an Apple Powerook, some inline skates, and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy and evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underlip of "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old knocker.
These are the moments of random madness that could heat this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series, until he reaches what I assume to be his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another type of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the movie "Aomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West ring struggle iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gigs to look at (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.
In six long episodes, it moves away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited to a smaller length, could deliver his Agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef visit the American Embassy again and again, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for a situation.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own younger history and with its own.
Fighting drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in beating the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as reported by the Konstanz public prosecutor on Friday.
Fifteen defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in Italy at the same time.
Against the two suspects Italians there were German arrest warrants.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
The project was attended by Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, over 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder and robbery and blackmail.
Since summer 2016, the Konstanz Public Prosecutor's Office has been investigating drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo, and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the major effort was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations focused on Italian nationals closely related to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, should go to the band's account.
Wisely complains of large gaps in the Alien Register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreigners register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious misdecisions in asylum proceedings.
According to a media report, the Federal Government's Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to major gaps in the Foreign National Register.
In the case of asylum procedures and deportations, shortcomings in the data recorded there could lead to "partly serious misdecisions", cautioned in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the register, 10 million people with foreign nationality are covered, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by around 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Since the data had not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who have long been no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should not actually appear in the register".
"Failure data input can significantly slow return processes," the report continues.
In addition, EU citizens were included in the statistics on persons subject to expulsion who did not have to leave at all.
Such false assignments, however, led "to a distorted debate on the handling of aliens", according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government apparently started sending refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy when they arrived there.
This is reflected in an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, BAMF carried out such procedures "for families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on site.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees are the responsibility of the EU Member State which they first reach.
If a migrant moves on to another EU country, this state can send him back to the country of entry.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased considerably".
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, the left-wing political spokesman in the Bundestag, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatened by the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system by conditions that are illegal for the reception of people and by the danger of the well-being of the child".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday.
All in all Jürgen Greule, who with his now 100 donations divided 50 liters of blood.
Traditionally, in the municipal council meeting, the congregation celebrates the willingness to donate blood on a number of occasions.
"It's brilliant how our body is designed to do this and we're going to respect the donors who provide their blood for strangers, and we're still making no use of it," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), for the canned people are dismembered into their parts.
That's how three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK leader.
Obviously, the switch to the theatre house had led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Prior to that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 donations each.
Half as many people wrote Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave up 500 millilitres of life each.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and a slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation by an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "slow" as it maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) policy-makers voted by 6 to 2 in favour of keeping interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in autumn.
But she pointed out that in the coming years interest rate increases would be necessary in order to boost the inflation heated by Brexit and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut Conjunctural Package, which was issued one year ago after Brexit.
It will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper finance for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more under this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on real household income continues to affect consumption."
At interest rates, it reiterated that "a certain level of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and "something larger" than the markets expected.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "step-by-step" and "limited".
The Bank's downward growth forecasts for this and next year are as compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision does not change, since the latest disappointing growth figures have reduced the rising expectations of an increase in interest rates and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year.
The recent inflation report had little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low wage increases, as the exacerbation first worsens before improving.
She added that in the coming years monetary policy will not be "inhibiting the rise in income", but she added that wages will be "clear" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also being strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision came one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to achieve full prices and economy.
Prior to the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates had increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers calling for an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% last month to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun relative to its 2% target was "all" attributed to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is expected to become more competitive again, as lenders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and the new mortgages close, and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."
NHS (The National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
From September onwards, patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in NHS.
NHS England reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken prior to sex, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He declared that he was willing to finance the process after the Appeals Court had confirmed last year a Supreme Court ruling that NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it.
The campaign announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called it "a decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow registration of people, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in the case of infectious hazards.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are available in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics suitable participants who agree with the study, including men, women, transgenderers and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy, are identified.
People who live in England and are registered with a home doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study will assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as it is used, accepted and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, "This major new intervention should complement and overcome the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress of more than three decades in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with a high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study should be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV should be left behind.
Now that PrEP testing has been done, we are in the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Shadow Health, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and exaggerated after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will help us to get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society'.
Living the Big Life: Intermediate and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It lies on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.
"Before, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room facility with a nestled layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my demand," she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi's Duck & Shed architectural and design studio from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
He had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bend.
It was not only a question of building a simple platform, but of building the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with much additional drama.
For the middle floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage operator.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced MDF door.
"It's counterweighted, so if you push the door up, it glides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the floor."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor surface while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can transform itself from something standard to something amazing due to good design and increased square meters.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave it.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how his property and business assets are to be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business at Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and about one third.
A court document states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of property and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed proceedings.
The brothers are now also fighting for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, had excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but instead urges Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage presupposes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both pages.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacy shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "high school in my last years, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to pass on their property to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, whereby Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and $26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says "become bitter over the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin has been very reluctant, although he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case was in court.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court in a letter that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "always hopes for a solution".
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be solved by the courts in the near future," said Colin.
Trump's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President's media abstinence.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including the reports of the media - in the hope of keeping the head on a more even footing.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with senior officials on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the President's hands.
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to ram Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship to television is going back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"When candidate Trump was upset by unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of positions that were to be convinced," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trump's Tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his staff managed to keep him away from him a few times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is made up of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico, busy with this story, reported in May on the willingness of the consultants to provide the president with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is trying to find out where they come from.
This happened at the end of February, when a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet Provocator Charles C. Johnson, accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence, or that he made false accusations in the past and rescinded them.
Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, get the Trump".
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped.
The police throughout Europe this summer sent (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are naturally not known, indications from the population are hoped and desired.
Europol reported on Friday on the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar from winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding from holiday destinations, it was Europol.
21 postcards have been compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been visited more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online seekers have been arrested so far, at least 11 of them due to information after publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate over a dig and return to the 'Millionaire series'
Some of the most wealthy houseowners of the West Midlands are once again standing on a war foot with some determined travelers who have negotiated a church-drawn grave to demand a field back in front of their master houses.
The travellers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy road of Solihull, which is called the "Millionaires-Series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May, but without being frightened by a trench excavated by the council to prevent their attacks.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have urged the advice of Solihull, who said that it "is useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long lessons to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last round of these travelers, just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the park area."
A speaker of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls police. We are taking the necessary legal steps to ensure that they move forward as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof will be the Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof will be the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
With the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, approximately 30 000 overnight stays were lost each year and also revenue from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, given the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees entering the district, the hotel building was offered to the Land Council Office as a collection accommodation, leading to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not disputed in the municipal council at that time.
But most of all, Julian Osswald, Mayor of Freudenstadt, defended the hotel location and spoke to serious stakeholders at the time.
He should keep the right.
The Luisenhotels group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the town of joy.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Its name is Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
Until March there is still much to do.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms will be equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows will be installed.
Everything should become "beautiful" later, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a jewel."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but you already want to position yourself at a high level in the city centre, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its about 60 rooms, wants to set up itself wide, explains Scherer.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel at ease at the hotel.
He had already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The city's ideas were identical to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
After the level of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to make a precise determination.
Just under a million euros, he calculates.
The external installations are also brought to Vordermann, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Friendstadt is a good market".
Russia case: US special investigator uses Grand Jury
In Russia's case for US President Donald Trump, Special Investigator Robert Mueller reportedly appointed a so-called Grand Jury.
The board has taken up work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations.
The CNN station reported that there were already initial submissions from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of having specifically intervened in the 2016 presidential election.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump's electoral team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted in the electoral campaign as advisors to the Republican.
According to reports, Mueller also took over more and more Trump's private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump personally went to the centre to investigate the accusation that the president might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine the evidence available in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to prosecute.
The Grand Juries are therefore also referred to as Chambers of Prosecutions.
Most of the time, they will be activated when they are larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The panel can also be called on by the prosecutor's office to invite persons to the hearing under oath.
According to CNN, charges have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those who participated in the meeting were invited to make a statement, as stated in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then Chief Electoral Officer Paul Manafort attended the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the installation shows that Mueller did not let himself be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
However, it did not necessarily have to be said that the Grand Jury will be involved at the end in order to decide on the prosecution.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray Russia's affairs as a campaign of its political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention," said Trump.
The topic gives the Democrats a chance to "feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about".
His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he did not know about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But he also usually worked in secret, he emphasized.
The White House supports any measures that speed up the work of the Special Rapporteur in a "fair" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey had said three times that he was not being investigated against the president.
There was no reason to believe that there had been a change in that, it was stated in the statement.
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump Comey fired.
Because of this rejection, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hinder justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After portraying US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees.
That triggered speculation as to whether Trump would release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at pressure of the President by the Ministry of Justice.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the Special Rapporteur could no longer be released so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the Western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has dissolved from the Schelfeis.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs over one trillion tons and is 5,800 square kilometres, is now heading north and will probably need two or three years to melt it.
It is one of the largest ice giants in the past three decades, with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres.
A danger to humans does not arise from him.
According to researchers, the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking down the iceberg is unclear.
However, for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice smelters in the region, the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The colossus that has now been broken up has been a part of Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Sheep feed swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus grows further into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this scallop, the balance of growth and break-up was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete spelt was broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that Larsen-C-Skelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never been as far removed as it is at present.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and could break down if a piece of ice breaks down at a keypoint.
The melting of smelting and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and the ice pushes as much water as it does after melting itself.
However, the loss of the spelt results in the glaciers being able to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could potentially increase sea levels, but only to a limited extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Smelfeis is the fourth largest schelfeis in Antarctica, according to AWI data, with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front to the free ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down there regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now becoming a more endangered position," said Martin O'Leary from Swansea University.
"This is the largest withdrawal since the beginning of the recordings," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it was controversial whether the Larsen-C festival would grow again or go back in the long term and perhaps coincide, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not lead to climate change in this gigantic iceberg, over the past few decades a great many ice shells of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.
This long peak of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees Celsius over the past 50 years and thus counts among the areas where the temperature rises most rapidly.
CDU wants home rate at the staff
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU calls for the employer's association to step out in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break did the circuit day gain 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now again 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching posts in the circle are apparently very sought after.
Some 620 applications were submitted for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently there are still 50 non-occupied places in the Mettmann district.
Doctors and engineers, as well as general administrative forces, are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the district day and to tackle the lack of skilled staff in the administration.
The administration is to "work out a concept for the recruitment and development of personnel" as desired by the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals, but also to address the short-term needs of applicants in the future.
The overall approach should focus on the inside and the outside, show concrete measures for cross-country climbers and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that were previously unknown.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is about a fair "competition of public employers".
In addition, a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
So maximum time to act so that not more places remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, the leader of the CDU Group, goes beyond the common request with his party.
He recently caused a faust-thick surprise during the circuit day when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cover and surprised the other parties.
People want to see all the possibilities that make it possible for the municipal employers' association to leave.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the district cities - should seek a house tariff," says Peoples.
The CDU is thus trying to pay employees and civil servants better than is provided for in the collective agreement for the public service.
Wages are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards years of work.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy amplifies the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs who use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German relief organization 'Youth Rescue' because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations made by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in an opinion on the social media.
"We can only assess all the allegations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Youth Rescue', the Iuventa, since October.
It is assumed that its crew will be taking on board pipeline migrants who will be delivered directly to them by human dealers, and that smugglers will be able to take off so that the ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting was said to have taken place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose contents were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of removing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have, above all, an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring "essential changes or handicaps" to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel laureate organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said in the meantime that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy had fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperate with local mayors had been successful.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berliner Ausßerposten" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trial and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
Accommodation in the Wachtenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachtenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
There followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which you could look far over the Palatinate forest and the upstream plains.
In the meantime, there were longer increases that rewarded long trials.
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the vantage point at the vantage point, coupled with "flowy" trials and moderate increases, was repeated.
In the last two days, many meters of altitude had been set back.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and return huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breath in the open-air inhalatorium solitude.
New Town was also controlled.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sports
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of sweating themselves over the stadium lawn in wind and weather?
The fact is: E-Sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high odds included.
This has also been recognised by the first federal leagues that are increasingly engaged in this area.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and lastly VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport division in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says Jochen Röttgermann, Executive Board member.
He is sure that "on this train some clubs will rise".
The next weekend, FIFA will be organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the gamers of various clubs will compete against each other.
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds that the young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sporters under contract you could be present online far more often in these markets than just once a year sending the federal league team to Asia.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sport, computer games like "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are being challenged at competitive level.
In the long run, as in normal sports, leagues have been established in which the pros are fighting each other.
And at the 2022 games in Asia, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a proper sport at all?
For many, the idea is definitely a need for habit.
Ingo Froboose has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capability.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The clever player is a good player."
Frooöse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were lacking.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, which is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Unternehmensberatung Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years turnover is expected to be 130 million.
This is little compared to the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football league.
However, the e-sport "is no longer far away from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or hockey", the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries are already further away.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot of work in Europe.
E-sports had been introduced as a teaching subject in a Norwegian school, says Froöse.
In the Netherlands and France, the football-Erstliga-Verein according to Dutt is now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In the European comparison Germany is lagging behind", explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia and to clarify the old days is not enough today.
It is a question of preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time directing the company to the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything remains as it always was."
Gift eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
From the scandal of poisoned eggs almost all the Länder are affected.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and removed all eggs from the market throughout Germany.
Only eggs which are proven not to contain fipronil should be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics that Conrad Roy wrote
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is out of touch.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her attorneys argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and down eyes when she was convicted.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She hasn't shown any regret."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "wrong circumstance that she totally regretted."
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find that her "old age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on her actions".
A public prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that there is "no day I will not regret the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was being "persecrated" by the knowledge that she would never participate in her brother's wedding or would be an aunt for his children.
"No more having this only person I've been with since I was born every day is a pain that I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to invite another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's textual announcements revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Get up, jump from a building, first of all yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murdering her British fellow citizen in Italy before being released two years ago, was one of the few.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the New Mini-Lahm of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run off as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern will be the winner of the Confed Cup for a big season - there is no harm to the extra-motivation.
Something else was there in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the additional garment was very, very small.
But since, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, he was holding his arm on his hands.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner told us afterwards, after his first job as Bayern captain.
Well, the stand could have run better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But Kimmich could also interpret the sign of the coach.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been selected as the leader of the C-Elf, which was made up of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come out of the holiday.
Sugars are best distributed to those to whom you have a great deal of trust that you want to keep in a mood.
So anyone who has been chosen to enter the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-lahm.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on the arm you did the rest.
And at all Kimmich acted in this start formation like the one who can best take the rower into his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unplayed force.
He had the look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness (did hardly work); Renato Sanches to get out of the way to the performance of the Asian trip (did only work as a result); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not seem negative in their first appearance in the Bayern triot.
After all, it worked quite well.
Süle ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The well-known occupied Napoli storm often took a hard time, and Süle also tried a few times successfully in the game building.
Although his colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped".
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "For this style I was also picked up".
How unusual this Bayern world is for the new entrances, was seen after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but certainly gave six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said good-bye after a few sharp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
In Bavaria you just have to win every game".
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba Motivates OEFB Women
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most well-known football player reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB lady all the best.
The Bayern-Legionary is almost a fellow member of the club of ÖFB-Capitänin Schnaderbeck and is part of our ladies.
The Tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational syringe.
Our ladies might need the famous Bayern shower as well.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often inconsolable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This can be seen after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V's request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trier Company Association (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy which Lemke has completely blocked".
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: The gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes to establish a plan procedure, and by 2021 the building law will be in place.
A role in the plans of the country is also the West umgehung Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Route Plan.
The aim was to take the route into operation in December 2020, says Minister of Foreign Affairs Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a way forward to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier aims, as suggested by Wissing, to create a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sinking for ten years.
Wissing also has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the passed master's degree and 2500 euros when graduates are self-employed within ten years of the master's degree.
But the country's homework list remains long.
The planned road construction should be done quickly, while the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to set up Wissing at the state-owned operations, only 29 have been employed so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
CDU faction vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that in 2017 and 2018, the country invested more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a country's concept of how to remedy the lack of skilled workers in the region.
It is also disappointing that the country has expanded its broadband base so far.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed network provision in an IHK survey only with Note 3.4.
They complain about existing Internet connections and interruptions.
The former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the Pro Wind wind company.
The Green Group left Lemke for April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months she already cleared the field again because of disagreements.
Audi is to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" and therefore referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the company as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of causing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which used so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but drive back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were accused, others being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a question focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
This message has the fleet on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join us, a fleet runs through Munich on tomorrow Saturday, which has a special message.
When the Isar is once again drawn on Saturday, he will see a large raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not an ordinary raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building office wants to clarify it.
On the fleet you can see a large infotransparent.
It's showing a müllberg.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Truhre Liebe is...", the understanding for the Isar is to tighten up as a protected wild river.
Last summer the fleet passed over the Isar and this year there will also be further actions and measures to achieve a cautious and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos Knollenäsen and the laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon characters, the knots of his figures are his trademark.
At 85, the Argentinean still draws and works on a film.
His message: laughter, "for there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the early years as an artist, he was able to work out, among other things, as a drawing for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artists were inspired by cities.
Big round Mordillo figures tumple in drawings with the Shive Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he is still sitting on the signboard today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plushs and watches his funny figures continue to spread widely around the world.
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is supposed to come onto the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
Therefore, he focuses on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordless.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to the drought-remembering conditions and the disease-transfering insects, causing great headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small zikade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf zikade, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very much in demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions considered include better water distribution and the slowing down of evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhine celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.

The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in Sinaloa State through organized crime, corrupt officials and continuous drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were informed that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which was the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, ally.
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal sensations are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government's or cartel salary list, a catalogue of criminals who put Mexico's chaos at risk.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are in the wake of attacks and threats under federal protection and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.
Among the latter are her editor and her inspiration for Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" depends on the façade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecution was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only two criminal proceedings were initiated.
As with most thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are untroubled and the terrain is now even more traitoric.
Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"Until we know why, we all distrust."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind one wife and two grown children.
Rumours tend to fly around Culiacan freely.
But on the subject of Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings who are bigger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is guilty of breaking down the fact that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, an interview with Damaso Lopez was published, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper skioske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he merged with five colleagues to form Riodoce and sold US$50 in equity.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and revenue and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the Committee's International Press Freedom Award for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever she went.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life", he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the task that happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb one.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misss Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a harbour worker, the friend who was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine destruction?
His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you're dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways, and their landpaths to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "You have a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space where the Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days before, it was announced that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.
Half a joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police that the Governor himself called untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on the government expenditure, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the governing institutional revolution party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-level corruption cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this location, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have considered the Valdez column as the best-informed source of kidnapping.
"Before we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body structure.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdez office was reassigned to the sign and sticker storage room protesting the murder of journalists because the employees have become something they would never have expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the public prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it's his.
Journalists across the country have become louder by writing "SOS Press" in organised protests on footpaths and buildings.
On that day, director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice system in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they said the truth.
She has since asked for it to be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials involved in it and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces, who were covered up with organized crime.
The media watch group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists and officials last year.
"You die in Mexico because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, like the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Break in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with an editorial on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who remain behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition had already been finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all of their phones started to sum up.
A number of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war further escalated, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the edge of the board they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens cried out in the vicinity - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the police who were holding guards to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the late founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees followed his footsteps.
"How can you just think about closing it," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for report."
Dinosaurs used tact to avoid their enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian miners have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even see that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said they had something of a "unsettling past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described him as "the best preserved armoured dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world".
Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Creation Age.
Its incredibly well preserved condition has surprised researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armoured plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of the earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes flashing, you could almost believe it slept," said the lead author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved copies of dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that, although covered with an armor and similar to a walking tank, this plant eater was probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white disguise to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed itself to be better mixed in its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, indicating that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent over 7,000 hours carefully discovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of sheds and armor over his body.
They discovered the countershadowing, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although counter-shadowing is common, the results are surprising, as the size of borealopelta far exceeds that of today's living animals.
It indicates that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shadowing - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodator was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Powerful predatory behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous Age must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for evidence of his life, including his preserved bowels, to find out what he ate as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he fell to the seabed on his back.
At that time Alberta was as warm as southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early Creation Age.
You don't need a lot of imagination to rebuild it. If you're just a little licking your eyes, you could almost believe that it's sleeping."
The Creation Age was a time when huge Theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived for millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk after death in the sea and mummyd in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long tips that pulled off his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armoured plant eater was swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater funeral kept his armor in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the Havettes still cover hollow panels along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Glazed remnants of the skin still cover the hollow panels that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is at his side, his five fingers are spread up.
I can count the sheds on his sole'.
In the thunderstorm: Mass Caram companies on A8: Many injured
Heftier accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass caram companies.
There are numerous injured, miles - long traffic jams and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-München motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured at a mass caram company in the late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police's initial reports, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, had been combined during a thunderstorm at around 5 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg County).
At first, there was no information on the exact number of injured persons.
It is about slight to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large supply of life-saving vehicles was at the scene.
The A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backrest of about ten kilometres was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive handicaps on the counter-road – through numerous donations.
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the drivers who now have to expect sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing imaginable is sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
Come to the creator and wake up one unwitting or tear the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the time of the interruptions will soon be over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you took your place and thus devalues the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"When the offer arrives, we expand it.
It will then be expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said one rail speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" the train calls the ticket cancellation without Schaffner.
However, in order to be able to use them, some prerequisites need to be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what do most passengers do anyway?
You also have to purchase it via the app of the train, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.
And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: you get on the train, call his ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic devaluing will then appear in the test customers.
The train attendants will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to place Y at the ticket check, he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, work, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.
"If you want to travel through our train crew without a ticket check-in, you simply check in the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal on the train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often drive trains know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest troubles.
Because often you do not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets yourself, but in any case one of the passengers does.
Either the credit card or ID card are missing or a document you need to present.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, leading to a bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in checking your own ticket and taking the time to take care of other concerns at the end.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this is also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet fully accessible.
How did an activist get to learn the answer to the question: "Who Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, she sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment in St. Louis, which she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone in high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said.
Confused because no one else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped her cell phone off to return to Tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who wore a sign with the inscription, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed in front of a group of protesters with a ringing dog.
In another video, she said, another cop unsettled his gun and shouted, "I'm gonna kill you... animals all."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we used to and can call typical."
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and wept."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from the 11th century onwards.
It is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and of resistance from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning »about the black experience and the black condition«.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me," said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to get free to free ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky to give her an experience where she doesn't experience any acclaring racism personally, she's no different from the next black woman child.
I feel like I'd give her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department that became a campground when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"
This scepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people, often white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director, Damon Davis, an artist from the field who is known for his activism about the death tract of Denmark.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals, followed the team of "White Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't someone who speaks to us or speaks to us. We're talking," said Davis.
"This was the main thing for me as these people are represented, for that is how I will be represented."
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader, but a community coming together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "White Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I have understood that there must be a degree of vulnerability to this work and to the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider black-lives-matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, made the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's why we keep fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who shook up this energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, even though she was at the front line, because in a lifetime at these intersections as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went to Ferguson on the road three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
From "Traum" to "Größenwahn": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The subject hardly leaves you cold.
The topic will also be discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole show), from the other side comes: "Don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Größenwahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the advocates are building on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, the rest of the shops also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the property where the farm market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the beginning of the construction work will thus be finished.
The Galerie-Macher want to integrate a market hall into the new building - with the possibility to sit outside to the Beda-Platz.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the Farm Market Hall almost weekly for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women are always very happy.
We also discovered the butcheries for us.
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer, even during and above all after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there are also.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, the rent will increase.
But this is not likely to be very low for the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this unnecessary.
There's enough of that in our town.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least we remain in the market hall.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also price-value.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there's almost no more special shops and what's left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall doesn't fit me together.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farm market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery comes eventually.
Or does the spectre of bit gallery already make it possible to sell all the business from bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "This just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a proper farm market instead of this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, thanks to the insane many - as I think - no more space for meaningless construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farm market hall is broken, another piece of culture will disappear."
A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuously similar - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst passed a 35-year prison sentence after making public classified diplomatic announcements on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblanche.
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and ground-breaking dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days left in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from manning and created from the 30 portraits that someone might look like with these genomic data, has created a sharp, albeit intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - which many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly talking about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her picture was suppressed so much that there was only one photograph - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which manning apparently sits unwell on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blooming wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of its 2012 project 'Stranger Vision'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette gum and gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create an image of how these people might look.
That was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her detained muse became unequal letter friends, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea's verdict would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
That Obama would actually demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informers from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further detonate the rigid divisions he was supposed to repair.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "Things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which was gender, race, sexuality and culture" with her oversized signature below (the "i" in her family name is bearing a heart).
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hope to take from it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own space, is a page from the above mentioned comic novelle.
She shows Manning how she appears in hand with a freephone from the United States Disciplinary Archers like King-Kong.
"If they get your speech cold, they won," it says.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition - as it was predicted in the comic book in advance - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulacres, which gather like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Mannings Stature), where their genetic Haplo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University wanted to kill him
A country-wide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who are being sought out as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the files of the Civil Court of Cook County.
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau, 26, died after several stings.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the incident, and detectives investigate the stings as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officers.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been on leave and had been excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the British police and ready to help the U.S. investigative authorities in every possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said that he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the time axis and background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will conclude the WADA Roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko
The Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the road map criteria, RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA Roadmap has been updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he has nothing to worry Russia about.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-funded dopings in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has allowed a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."
Mutko's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
In November 2015, in the course of the Doping scandal, RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit by the headquarters of the organisation in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be used again.
Aldi doesn't sell eggs for the time being.
This was reported by the groups of companies.
It was a precautionary measure that could not be further affected by any health impairment, it was stated in the communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which were proven to have been tested negatively for fipronil-containing anti-slip agent.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck of your e-commerce startup with your employees, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Erret, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C suite executives and to contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track their health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Saved said that they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel over the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can trace why.
Companies come to realize that at the top of the workplace culture you need to stay so that you don't become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment that penalizes those who have spoken.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion worth in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up converter, which helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber trap in misrepresentation.
Convert has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convert allows Convert companies to send tailored "puls" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.
And when the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convert.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee flight and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convert for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, make a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convert, problems that have previously been hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree vision in the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies started taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took for the "social media to come to justice" that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convert offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors that have supported both start-ups.
Convert received $10 million in February financing from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the total capital up to $47 million.
Glitters secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just investments.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices heard, and that the work you do is worth doing, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convert and Glint.
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and committed.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on the employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture are important.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and discourage employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who saw companies that have relied too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Do you care about that?
And who don't worry about why should I?"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem about Glint is reported, said Redemption.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganise several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bonding of employees in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's about 11:00 when a lot of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team's new fields of practice on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey uppers and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Aquarian Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real foothold for the guys the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the player's load, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA training sessions should begin at 19:15 in order to meet the already packed time schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood did practical exercises.
They are supposed to do 18 exercises during August. 20 before the formal preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the rule change of the NCAA, even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players.
"We put this enormous burden on her for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they stick around, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been launched with footballs that have cleared a safety net behind a tortoise post.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far off to think that people rent a room there and then set themselves there to record an exercise.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I am not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact check in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party fact auditors and show their results below the original post then said the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It’s one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company stated in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and send them to fact auditors who may show the results of the fact check from the original article.
Facebook was criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to penalise social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled postings, as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook, in a separate statement in German, said that a test of the new facts check will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to knowing what stories are being challenged by third-party fact auditors, people want more context to make informed decisions about what to read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature of the "connected article" and work on other changes to his message feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England
In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a morphic Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the Middle Ages to Edward's Age and documents the families who lived in Scotland. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumb print!
And letters always smell like smoke, for at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he were himself.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I overrated my welcome") this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and peculiarities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic".
Diaries, letters from the era of the English Empire, maps showing who owned what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a Birke who fought for the two families.
Boys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse itself in English history on a wider basis, including 'The Labourer', who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected together?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century was portrayed, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite a gauner, constantly making debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them to be a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to promote heirs."
After the end of his work in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Lebensmäki, the site of a Sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been re-requested by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle covered in Rhöndorf
With the cover of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand (show of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"To us.
Or?", the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!)", they write on their website, which is open yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
In essence, we are firmly convinced that, as Bad Honnefer, we know very well the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action involves more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive uniqueness."
Finally, she competes with other municipalities.
A medium five-digit amount can be spent by the city of Bad Honnef on its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and transfers in the military corps.
So is this week.
At first glance a normal procedure.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it was before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
Under the chairmanship of the Head of Government, the five Vice Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions.
Thus the civilians in the YAS were in surplus.
The government pulls the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were removed.
Since the failed coup, state head Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as a wire puller of the coup d'état.
About 486 people, who are supposed to have been directly involved in the coup, have been traded in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt "the gift of God" as he gave him the opportunity to "clean the forces completely".
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unease in the Military Headquarters".
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "islamization" of the army, which manifest itself, among other things, in the lifting of the head cloth ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
The great cleansing of the army and the security forces goes on anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan issued a decree to fire 7395 state servants, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had emboldened the military.
The generals used to be the real lords of the country.
Three times they pushed for their role as guardian of the worldly order.
After his victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed down military power step by step, not least by calling on the European Union's reform targets.
Former officers say Erdogan is specifically advancing an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe" a not-called officer, who sought asylum for fear of persecution abroad after the coup, warned that the Turkish army would be "full extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that were true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
After the clean-up of the alliance, there are still doubts about the Turkish army's readiness to use it.
The management structures and operational capabilities were "weak," say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US spends green cards on its citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show them the knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate track for racetrackshuttle
Over the past few months, the future of the race platform has been disputed - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year is to be built on the Marode track on which the tourist train runs.
In order to ensure the future of the race platform in the long term, construction work on the track is scheduled to begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this important link, especially for tourism," said Klaus Sühl, Secretary of State for Transport at Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of repairing the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros.
Of this amount, the country takes 75 percent.
The agreement, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently finalised, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operators had already agreed on the technical details.
"This negotiates the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards," Sühl said.
The planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a duration of 11 years.
The race platform shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a train connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, which is popular with tourists.
In recent months, pilot operations have tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also very constructional in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just when you thought it couldn't get more crazy in 2017, a new report comes on the technological developments in the area of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails.
"People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will get to see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the robot's eye colour to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots possess the "personalities" that would allow a Stepford woman to look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," the website of True Companion warms up.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
It can be tired, fixed to conversation or it can be "in the mood!"
There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female qualities, alluding to rape, when you take a step on Frigid (heaven here: reluctant) Farrah, worry one most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what is leaking out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market allows them to do so.
There is some overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually attacked women.
The most discouraging aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') are not the graphic images, the veiled bodies and the excruciated eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it doesn't feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, put to the point, when it comes to their "personalities", the robots are not real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total subjection.
In other words, they are decent slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: servant girl
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney part of the common sense
It has become a binge wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. government have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival, there were newspapers in the United States advising on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s chosen relatives.
We've all said we're tightening up to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in a further context that this also entails significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the horrendous effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the creepy possibility that one day his mütchen will no longer cast us off.
There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing "normalize" which suddenly seem to be a reference to reasonableness compared to its standards.
Today I find myself attacked by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's absurd version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - which both occur in comparison to Trump in fact as a very mild criminal offence.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate only has to be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are tricky and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not fit the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a major circulation in the north of London.
However, the Central Park Carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on this and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffeehouse on the corner of my street, it is the same plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the department store was excusingly grinning, while I was tired of having the experience of handing her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from the prison moved to the hospital
For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, because of the treatment of cuts on his wrists, he was brought to the hospital, which according to the prison authorities, he suffered after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend to be a night intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to file this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appeal, of which they say it is too lenient.
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his punishment being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the four-schoolers were released from the Futzen and Epfenhofen during the holidays and in the secondary schools.
Three of the dropout students will go to high school in the future, four to the real school.
On Tuesday evening, the school principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Town Hall in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol of the school leave, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regina Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm, but is then released into freedom.
In addition, the münzeer Schar performed a musical titled "Der Adler im Höhnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it brew out of his chickens.
A little eagle came out instead of a chicken.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him was shattered, the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and escaped.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The horses danced with the young goggles, the cylinders carried to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
Although the young is different from the other young animals (cows), they belong to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His purpose was to be free.
She wished every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
Thank you to colleagues, former headmaster Michael Müller, who is constantly entering school after school, and to the parents.
The period of the chicks was now over, explained the class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she only very unpleasantly released her students, because it was a really great time.
Finally, they could have relied on the fourth graders.
In the end, all the students made a song about summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy with the children.
Eight first-graders have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by TV, reported.
On the morning of August 1st, a group of illegal tenting people was arrested in Sithonia by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened control over the free camp and impose substantial fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the affected people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do Diesel drivers have to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission performance of Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 vehicles.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The previous mandatory updates only apply to vehicles that have foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Motor Vehicle Federation (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has informed everyone to write to them.
If an inspection is required anyway, it will be done within its limits.
How long are the upgrades supposed to take overall?
Smetanin says, "Shut up to say."
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on the political pressure.
"For we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far."
How long should the update last?
The upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do car drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers would retaliate, says Smetanin.
Does a massive fall in prices of Euro-4 cars now threaten?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honours this year.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and take part in the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The winner of the progressive TV series, Lear, has already announced that he would not participate in the gala.
The "New York Times" he said: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to withdraw the means - and that burdens me."
The 59-year-old Estefans stressed that they would use the conversation with Trump to clarify their views.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, will retire next year.
The job has already been posted - suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work still makes him great fun of how he communicates in the press.
He reports of varied but demanding tasks waiting for his successors.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet met the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer as soon as possible.
Thus, subject to the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for inclusion.
Since Haslach acts as the Second Building Law Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must submit corresponding degrees.
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they could no longer fill this out, citizens would have to go for advice until Offenburg.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good operating climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, a number of important projects have accumulated, with Wacker looking back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and its staff.
But also in the future there are many different projects on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will beat you with around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," said Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
There was great room for design for a city builder.
Haslach's own farm and gardening can be used to react to many things quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned praiseworthyly by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to have "an eye for what fits in", when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder emphasizes.
In any case, the city builder has a high level of responsibility.
He's a builder, "it's all over my table in the end."
With regard to care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) has been involved for 15 years.
Wacker also wishes that his successor will stay long: "We're looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job".
Continuity is important not only for a good operating environment, but also for the further design of the city.
If you would like to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to complete a degree or Bachelor's degree in Architecture and have good skills in the areas of planning and construction law, according to the information provided by the city of Haslach.
The City Construction Office is responsible for building and civil engineering, building guidelines, land use matters, administration of municipal properties, Städtischer Betriebshof with Bauhof and Stadtgärtnerei and Untere Baurechtbehörde, including monument protection.
Bike thrown on wires: South Railway locked
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the track crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators leave from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the hours of the night.
Close to the scene, a pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a lausbubenstreich," said ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch on APA.
The person or the perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also put train traffic at risk.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the minutes of delay and the cost of the replacement rail transport, the railway customers could also have to pay for the perpetrators.
Overall, the speaker said that there was a "substantial" sum.
The damage had been fixed again on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern track could be managed without disabilities.
Almost ten passenger trains had failed on Friday, two of which were for long distance transport.
Freight trains did not go down, but they had delays.
According to ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (dental intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
The incurable condition, affecting around 1.3 million people in the United States and the United Kingdom, causes 300,000 stomach cramps and blisters, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not enter the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result.
Experiments have shown that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell is present in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their tissues.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have made a connection between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbioma, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had these immune cells".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel disease, if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoc Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was, however, separated, did not have such cells.
She assumed that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The dams of the mice were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal bioma and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan side products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genie" to Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genie", Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's 40 million pounds signature began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last preseason game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira formed after pleasure.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues' preparations-Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted, that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviv Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start XL for the start of the season.
The Independent this week revealed that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've made a lot of effort."
Boeing "malt" dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew off Seattle in Washington, D.C., but the drawing began in Marquette in Michigan, U.S.A., and moved across the U.S. in the form of a dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD chief, the Social Democratic Prime Minister always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no alarms from the party central, just no counterwind from the federal government - so was the most important desire of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has fundamentally changed.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD-run state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even have been described in the approach with counterwind.
It was a shock.
And one by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPDs and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot rule reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising group resignation of a Green Member has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the Landtag election, his red-green coalition lost its majority votes to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Executive Director Michael Kellner has asked the apostate Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the voter's will.
Each Twesten must immediately return its mandate," said the Federal Executive Director and the Greens' Chief Electoral Officer to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"That may not be true at all," a SPD election fighter sighs when on Friday morning the new Hiobs message reaches the party headquarters.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there after the Green MP Elke Twesten's transition to the CDU without his own majority in government.
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
Miseries began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland elections in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed down the comrades at the time.
After the Landtag elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That was the case then - and everything was getting much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to ruin, the Düsseldorf-Plaite haut the party smooth.
The comrades remembered hard in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next downfall.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because in the subsequent crisis communication he made pretty much everything that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil is.
Due to the VW waste gas business and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a long time.
Men's survey values came up.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of that, Because in recent weeks, we have been trying to focus more and more on the federal government.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden even in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They let him go because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Because, in essence, there is no blame for the in-party dispute between the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz isn't at all.
Meanwhile, the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed.
Your anger is directed at the Greens, and above all at the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democratic, as Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests about the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party's left-wing group in the SPD federal parliament, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but because of the country list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continues.
The logical consequence would be for her to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Bundestagsfaktion, complains of a "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The will to vote four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag election.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result," said Oppermann.
He called for the background to be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further commitments by the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for local centres III
Anyone who wants to renovate his house over the years can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development informed on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a look back on what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in Renovation Area I from 1991 to 2004, Baden-Württemberg had taken over two-thirds of the total funding.
In Renovation Zone II from 2005 to 2016, the grant still stood at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it is ultimately important to also promote internal development, and not only to open up new areas of construction.
On 4 April, the Board of Governors of Karlsruhe received information that there will be a redevelopment area III.
The funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros came from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How now does a rehabilitation area emerge?
One will, according to Schindler, examine where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role if there is any interest in renovating in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal program "Social City", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme are the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an objective basis, i.e. per plot.
The renovation area would then be defined as a statute.
Since 1 January 2017, the period for granting aid has been running until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would first be carried out, under which a questionnaire would be completed for those involved in the rehabilitation area.
As far as possible, the decree will be taken in November or December, so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is a matter of assessing urban problems and deciding when and to what extent it will be renovated.
There will then also be a renovation notice in the land register for the property concerned.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Empfingen again and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens by mail in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and real estate sheet", which covers, among other things, the building condition and the renovation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and dwelling sheet", information on the size, division and inhabitants of a housing area can be made.
The blue "operational sheet" is only to be filled when operating in the building business premises.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding.
Moreover, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding functions according to the "Windhund principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
No funding could be "reserved" for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make the present one a "flavourful" renovation.
British inventor puts himself in a microchip to get in the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open its door, enter its office, and even start its car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, an anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an additional charge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the military's information left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House conducted a tour of products from all 50 countries.
The Connecticut helicopter was exhibited next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire engine and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 a.m. on July 17 at 3 p.m. on the South Lawn for the event, and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of duty hours.
The original flight crew was on the helicopter during the event, while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time of the aircraft.
The records provided by TIME did not show clearly whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Datasets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was an infringement of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President launched the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government legislation.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft was performing taxi services in Melbourne, Florida, in the context of his first campaign rally, and his Twitter account is full of reports that were complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessors.
"The White House is delighted with the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 countries that are manufactured by American workers with American materials," said Lindsay Walters, Deputy Secretary of the White House.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights around Washington and the South Lawn to remove the US President in the White House with precise centimeter sets.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was one of the training needs of the flight crew for the month," one official said.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on that day for "non-presidency missions".
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly rates of the US Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D amounts to USD 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
"Determining the cost to taxpayers on the basis of the estimates of the refund rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual resources."
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD refund rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former White House press speaker, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
In the White House Trump spoke to Sikorsky's representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before tricky task
==References====External links==* Official website
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will enter Kiel tomorrow at 11 a.m. at the tabledritten Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games, the top rider of the Second National Tennis League has managed to make sense of reality.
Team manager Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially in the rear positions I find the team very good."
For class and stability at the Searchsdorfer SV mainly the imports from the high north ensure.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"This will be difficult for us as always.
You also need a good portion of happiness."
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north stands practically.
His debut for blue and white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman who is still active at the Challenger tournament in the Italian biella does not join the Bundesliga-Partie, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec will be the first to be played this season.
The previously unconquered Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel am Ball.
He was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one junior world ranking in January 2016, someone from the training staff around Marius Zay fills up the cadre.
How America Can Damage OMV
Donald Trump did not seem really happy when he signed the law to strengthen sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his haste to pass the law," the Congress had packaged a few "non-constitutional rules", he blasphemed.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US incident.
After all, the draft provides for the punishment of European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines in the EU.
This concerns investors of the local OMV, who together with other European companies co-finance the construction of the Russian North Stream 2 Baltic Sea Authority.
The threat scene is huge.
However, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life through executive orders.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" looked at who could defend the Group and who could really hurt it.
Narcos Season 3 Trailers: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be placed in the center of Netflix's hit line.
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killers, the series of Netflix is not over for a long time.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
Guided by four powerful sponsors, they only operate "like a Fortune 500 company" with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damiian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, who is the type, American and Colombian law enforcement agencies, inviting them to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel New Year's Eve, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city provides 46 kitchen helpers
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself again.
With strong contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city day centres.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the municipal day-care facilities (Kitas) again in its own direction.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Youth Aid Department, this is a good news: "We have all been very happy."
Cooking continues outside the house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 day nurseries in the Krefeld area, and in 44 the children get a warm meal at noon.
Last year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week, eat in the kita at lunch," explains Pomeranz.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care, if children stay until 2 p.m.."
46 part-time staff have kitchen services from 1 September: they heat up the food delivered, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, serving the meals individually, giving the food away, cleaning, washing and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a kit," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides on the length of hours.
"The kitchen helpers now belong firmly to the Kita team," says Pommeranz.
"So they are much more integrated and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the kitta line."
Because it is also about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is useful.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in the kita, a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people".
This continuity was important for children.
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only the quality improvement of the kitchen performance but also the charm that it has shown in comparison to its own direction and the best cost for the city, it says from the press office.
And that, though 46 part-time workers are re-assigned.
"But these hours do not fall so much into the weight of about 750 people in the education area," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Chief Executive Officer of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates in provincial council elections. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overrated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats to an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will peacefully hand over power from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will further strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered with a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men Trying to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are supposed to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who were staying with friends on Kolpingstraße at around 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the petition and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but that did not work.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is in progress.
GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure that managers of Biskuit manufacturer McVitie have a long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross location.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse.
McVities owner Pladis said he's invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "be the first to know" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the head of the company, GMB called on Scotland McVitie's "concerned that funding for the modernization of production lines would not be advanced".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said, "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply affecting our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the large Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie".
One speaker from Pladis said: "Tollcross's head of branch only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will react directly to it, as we appreciate the continuous engagement with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic environment, we are constantly reviewing our businesses - and this applies to all of our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise Tollcross’s heritage as a production site. If our operations change at the site, employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know."
Has the PSG warned Barcelona three years ago about Neymar?
The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not abandon her persecution of Neymar after she has offered an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago about the world record attack?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world’s highest-paid professional athlete. PSG offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president about this prospect?
When Manchester City showed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw a scooter placed in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the estate number 30 around it and thus executed damage to property by more than 200 euros in the disguise of the vehicle.
The Schramberg police, telephone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for clues.
To an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car met him on his track, the driver of a VW Touran had to avoid and touched the main course.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the way to Leese at around 19.55 on the B 215 from Stolzenau.
In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau, a car came to meet him on his lane so that he had to turn right.
The Touran driver touched the main plan.
There were damage to property on the car.
The driver of the approaching passenger car, a Mercedes Benz, had taken over a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen-Bericht discharges Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Cathedral Report on the Abuse Cases relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what the author and historian Michael Hesemann mean.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Palaces continues to provide discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are the Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expected an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral captain Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very helpful to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret for their own omissions or their wrong assessment of the practices at the time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticised the fact that reporting on violence in the cathedral stages is measured by "two-fold".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubted that it was "damaging and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" was striking, according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," Scaraffia writes.
Also Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with the Bavarian radio station: "You like going to church and this is a found eating".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "shocking was a normal educational tool" was "to be done with mean children, as I was one of them".
She found it unfair to apply today’s standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with reports of abuses, the Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the memorial volume "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages), said wrongly.
"I need to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he appreciates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report put forward by the Bishop of Regensburg, attorney Ulrich Weber, say?
Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburg Cathedrals were sexually abused "with high plausibility" victims of attacks.
The final report says of Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be said that in many cases, the forms of physical and psychological violence were applied by Domkapellemeister R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and, in many cases, even connect positive memories with him despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why in his opinion the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral statue Georg Ratzinger relieves.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on "The incidents of the use of violence on guardians at the Regensburg Cathedrals" gives a contradictory picture of the cathedral captain Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students raise their "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became handy when a cathedral statue did not provide a top musical performance.
How do you estimate this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you have a hard time reading the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
He has eight pages dedicated to him, and is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of fellow-actor or fellow-consciousness in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence in pre-school education also occurred outside its sphere of action.
One can at least accuse him of experiencing it too late or of not taking first indications seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent witness, describing him as "heat-hearted", "popular", "authentic", "competent" and "comprehensive", as a very good teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candies and "always changed from grapes to children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to rages.
The fact that he not only knocked with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also spread his ears and pulled too cheeky guys at the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
In his rescue, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread among parents and teachers during the period in question, in the 1960s and 1970s.
Do you also know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared with what this report actually deals with, namely, horrendous sexual abuse and violence in preschool schools, these are, of course, mammoths.
One wonders whether it has to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.
Many who have never understood him are still working hard on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media a great deal has been reported in connection with the report on abuse of the Regensburg Cathedrals.
In the final report, is Georg Ratzinger also burdened with any confusion or compassion in terms of sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have trusted the Cathedral Chapel Master.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," one person said, "It was very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims of shame remain silent.
If they didn't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir conductor, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in some ways in the profession.
How do the Domsparzen-Schüler Ratzinger assess the role of the Domsparzen-Schülers Ratzinger in relation to abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student interviewed put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that except for him ... boys have opened up intrusive or clearer than to their parents, boarding school principals, trust teachers etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable."
For example, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "It could not be confirmed in the context of the study that pupils affected by the study and/or their environment were entrusted to him in advance".
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free from any complicity.
Nor can he be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to the notice.
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these evil crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media much of "waltexessen" was to be read at the Regensburg Cathedral Palaces.
The former cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge blend of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is exactly the abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedral stages, between sexual abuse and violence, and, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents since 1945, including four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral statues.
All the terrible pedagogy, the cases in which boys from sadistic teachers were seriously harassed and tortured and suffered horribly, all of them took place in the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have ruled.
However, they had nothing to do with Domkapellemeister Georg Ratzinger, because he only got the boys on his face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
The subject of "preschool" was tabu on that, as the majority of witnesses stress.
One was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisic" states.
What else was there on the cathedral gymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and, in many cases, even connect positive memories with it in spite of violence".
So at most the accusation remains to have looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods of time in which it was told of the conditions in the preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just starting to establish himself and from the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then only again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the states?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Pathology, which the report even reproduces.
In this he points out that "in the pre-school the punishment for beating continues".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when punishment for beatings had long been banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey zone, as each one of us probably knows.
It was difficult for him to assess where the persons concerned might have been exaggerated or dramatic and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the penalty for beating schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "case trick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of assessing past according to today's moral standards.
That's where the prince is right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable, nor to what was broken in the pre-school of remorse and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was usual at that time.
That's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally done.
But at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ears and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then forbidden, he was also strict in keeping with it.
What picture of his time in Regensburg has Georg Ratzinger given in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the issue of beatings come into play?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, since the cathedral statues only played a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I do not in any way hide the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said once: without this perfectionism, without the challenge of absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class status from the previously more nationally known Regensburg Cathedrals, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candy alone, you don't make a great singer out of stubborn boys and stand before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-survival.
As what kind of person did you experience in the talks about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, thorough, deeply believing and heart-loving people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could even do something about a fly.
I regularly get in touch with him, how many former cathedral statues still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who until today do not forgive him that he was once strict to them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Today, most cathedral statues are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but he was also a loving respecter to whom they still look up to today and which they just worship.
And please make it quite clear: all that is proposed to him are educational methods which were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unjust to make a man, just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat.
There is the evil intention behind it, all too obvious.
For the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now there would be a warrant for a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merit and without whom outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany no one would know the Regensburg Cathedrals, finally to leave in peace.
