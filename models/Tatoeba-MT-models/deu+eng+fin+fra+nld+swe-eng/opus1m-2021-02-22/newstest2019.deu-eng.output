Yeah, she wants to...
"Beautiful Municherin" 2018 will be!
In the afternoon, another surprise is waiting for our candidates: they will not dispute the romantic candlelight shooting before the MY SOLARIS alone, but at the side of Male-Model Fabian!
Hvar - Flirting, twitching, seductive - no simple tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Muniches" candidates deliver with people photographer Tuan and defy wind, fish and rain like real pros.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB Chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question, of course, which depends on you coming into the conversation, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt that one or the other as it was laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "image magazine.
Despite the debate on the photos of Özil for months with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of the 92-time national player Özil.
"I would have liked it if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be the case until a certain time," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July, and this was also justified by the fact that Grindel did not defend him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB Chief of Staff reiterated his criticism to Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to build up any pressure, but he knows it from football so that when "you leave a team or change an association, you talk about it with his coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not happened so far".
Linz: Garden cottage burned in Schrebergarterlung
At 2:13 p.m., the Linz professional fire brigade was alarmed to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high voltage line leads directly to the Schreberg species settlement, there was a danger of delay.
The professional fire brigade stepped out and found the hut in full fire at the time of arrival.
The roof had to be practically completely removed and fire-fighting was to the extent absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden cottage, he had put a battery to shop at noon.
That could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must be determined - as does the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collector's pieces in his garden cottage.
Angry Mother fights: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open road
What has Lindsay Lohan just driven to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to take away the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live herself, as she apparently wants to take the children into a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Cut for luck" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, you can see Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to make as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family flees just before the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It urges adults to engage in trafficking in children.
For all that, she won't provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this straight", Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and lohan's missing a finger.
Under tears, the actress asks how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What Lohan has moved towards this action is at present completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The "Hayabusa2" probe started in Japan in December 2014.
She is to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that she can absorb material from his surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: number of deaths on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of strength 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are reported.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet moved into the deserted areas cut off by the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board
At the beginning was a Tweet.
At the beginning of August, Tesla chief Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletro automaker.
The U.S. stock exchange supervisor accused him of fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain Chairman of the Board.
Party of the British Conservatives
Guarded sharp - Tories Party Day
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party is supposed to be concerned with foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit Hardliners, at the front of the front ex-foreign minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new State name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is supposed to be called North Macedonia in the future, and that's what the population is voting on this Sunday - whether it's okay?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meant Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in Brazil is divided.
Thousands went to several cities on the street to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" appears as an anti-system candidate and is thus ahead of the polls.
His best competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: Dieselgate processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force still exists," said Development Manager Peter Mertens to the industry paper "Automobilwoche".
The incarcerated and on leave Audi Chief Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the Task Force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/drive combinations are expected to be tested," he said.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July we achieved an important stage in the preparation of the diesel crisis.
We completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the Diesel scandal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker had made "serious organisational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities are proposing to the audit chief that, after the waste gas fraud has been reported, they have authorised the sale of Dielautos with false waste gas values.
He knew of the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Bram Schot is head of the company as the Executive Board of the Commission.
Due to the conversion to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there are production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronn vote".
In principle, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations are already available.
Grindel strives to re-election - Lahm aims to DFB-presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel wants to re-apply as DFB President for the office next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning at ZDF's "Current Sports Studio".
You have to try again and again for a reelection, I will.
And then you have to check if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association felt it " remarkable" if, after the contract for the football-EM in 2024, he did not "want to participate in the future project".
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has fallen over the summer months affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of office of three years.
The next vote will take place on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future head of EM organiser Philipp Lahm is to participate in the DFB-Presidium.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would also be advised in the Bureau in the future in this role, and then, of course, he would be invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to take part in speculations as to whether Lahm could become his successor as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player without a migration background would become DFB's integration ambassador.
At the moment this office is exercised by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter having family roots in Cameroon.
"If one has a clear impact on society and football without a migration background and says, "the topic is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Lose correctly with half-fast scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the fat content.
It can also display muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the spice.
Doesn't he tell me if I replaced fat with muscle?
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear start for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball League.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-master easily won at 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
New entry With 20 points Rokas Giedritis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 Counters) from Ludwigsburg showed an appealing performance before 9113 spectators during his mandatory play debut.
Ex-master Brose Bamberg won at the mandatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was with 24 points of best throwers at the guests.
Würzburg-profi Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 counters.
Last year's Playoff semifinalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg invaded the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the most hit shooter with coach John Patrick's team.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the basketball lion Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new player Will Cummings overcame the oldenburgers with 25 counts.
The Braunschweiger, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the basketball quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver followers of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque the Cologne city centre had been partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were on duty - including snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is critical because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizens Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buffers and Scarecology
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York Central Park.
"Involve you wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on the night of Sunday, about 60.0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with french and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Also actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations showed themselves on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a shock when many spectators thought the sound of a collapsing metal lockout was shooting, fearing and trying to escape.
Soon panic arose, people ran apart.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed the people off stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizens Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet like every year.
Anyone who wanted to find out had to read and disseminate texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was cheer and applause - Buhrube for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake, on the other hand.
While he and his democratic colleague Chris Coons spoke out on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had declared himself in the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and thus hit many women in the head.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the accusations after two women who, according to their own reports, had themselves experienced sexual assaults on their way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet me at any time in an elevator," Flake said at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends journalist's rejection
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the rejection of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had moved a t-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The T-shirt, if not the problem, said Herbert the picture on Sunday.
It was a disturbance of the press conference.
The action of the journalist caused a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
He therefore caused personal protectors to bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor's Office.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah-Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: only at the beginning of September the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of the detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but in Turkey still processes run against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for happy conversations at the counter of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets her guests on a number of beer, wine or high percentage drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Not very few promises also drink courage for compulsory singing.
On Friday another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time, the actor Florian David Fitz is known from movies like "men's hearts", "terror - your judgment" or "The most awesome day".
But the trip to the high north was not at all good for the Municher.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely chaste on it, the eyes only two more little slots.
The bed selfie shows a completely lukewarm Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful hangover.
To his fans he posted some - probably not quite serious - findings, which he has now gained: "Regel eins: goes NIE to Inas night.
Rule two: never drinks the black sauce.
And syringe.
And the round of egg liquor, which Ina throws at half three, also leave away.
The consumption of alcohol is actually written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted some tips to fight the afterlife.
They ranged from instant broth, fish broth or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
As Ina Müller survived the nocturnal bed, it is not known yet.
Since she has moderated the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be clearly tried out...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and unratism
The entry into the 36 km long track in the Rotkoppchenland in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and dirty.
Recipes are sought against the greasing vandalism, but solutions hardly distinguish themselves.
Scherben, cigarette chickens, garbage and unrat, demolized garbage and meanwhile disassembled signs - this is how the entrance with a seat group to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented ever since.
A more than unbelievable sight for the front-end track in the Rotkäppchenland.
The topic concerns members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a longer time, according to the cycling commissioner of Ulrich Wöstenhagen.
The problem had already been raised in the cycling council.
There has been no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the point of entry.
"I think the latter would be the command of the hour - regardless of any further activities," says Deserthagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reported that he had also taken the topic to the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating group is on weekends regular meeting point to celebrate.
Not only is it often loud, the layers are also destroyed: posts torn from the earth, garbage demolerated, signs carved around, seat furniture embroidered.
Volunteers would have cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are upset that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is meeting point for the suspension.
"Over the entire cycle path, the Haaße-Hügel clearly focuses on this area," confirms the bicycle traffic officer, who is now also looking after the new bicycle station in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it gets really expensive."
Another idea was a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this sets the threshold significantly higher to break into common goods.
This would, however, presuppose that a police stripe will pass soon.
In principle, desert hedges wish for a development of the Haaße hill.
It had to be made more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle path so far could be very satisfactory.
Tourism marketing is yet to be expanded.
Our bike path is very high in Germany compared to others," said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa as a highly critical hazard.
There's no sign of the Haaße hill.
In the event of heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the road," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but it is a problem for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and mutual.
To offer "D a song for Hiltrup", is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eye-sinks in the friendly Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family association with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations appeared, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Imig, a long-lived albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltrup star colours", three members and three generations of the trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Blackies.
This contest, as District Mayor Joachim Schmidt explained, was a novelty.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city yet.
What did the writers see connected with?
The Hiltruper See and the Market Allee found particular mention in the places.
Rolf Immerig named the avenue in his striking song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
It was always about experiencing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their creation.
So one learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that he had recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has put on Youtube all the time.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomy.
There was something special for the jury's favourites - so that others can hear their songs.
An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Heimig with his Hiltrup-Schlager, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful appearance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children came to the finale once again - and even without electronic support they sounded "right good", as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, relation to Hiltrup, intangibility of the melody and recognisability value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfäß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association and Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She appreciated the event as a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full Kulturbahnhof.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams who are facing each other.
For each page, there is a view screen in which four cards with keywords can be deciphered - the old trick with the red foil - only when you have put them in.
This ensures that the opposite can not read by mistake.
On the cards is then, for example, to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd cube.
4th Party".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
For the terms are not to be guessed here, but codes.
In turn, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto", the terms behind the secret film should not be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice", "fest" and "window" in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and does not recognize the opposing team as far as possible; for this the party wins if he succeeds twice in breaking the code.
So the encryptor notes and reads loudly: " throw" for the cubes, "loose" as a contrast to party; here, of course, something like "party" would be possible and "prag" because he looked up at the school and knows the window crash there.
That's how it goes round for round, team for team.
One does not know the terms of the opposite - but it can be better combined with any indication the encryptor gives there.
Perhaps mysterious, but not too turned off, so the descriptions should be, otherwise it will be unnecessarily difficult for the team.
The most cryptic of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But anyone who first started will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this invisible game.
However, "Decrypto" is not as coherent as predecessors and genre primus "code names", which is also an agent theme with fewer words on a game, but much better to play in small groups.
And to whom it is only about guessing and not about points of victory, that can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greetings and harasses guests at the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspector Kulmbach at night from Saturday to Sunday twice.
First he showed Hitler's greeting in the upper town of a passing police strip, then later he also fell into a pub in the upper town when he harassed other guests.
After he did not follow the police's assigned place reference clearly alcoholized, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach Police Department in the prison cell.
In a more sober state, he must then also be liable for the use of signs of non-constitutional organisations under criminal law.
Betriebswerk Pressig was the home of the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, it was heard in a very urgent way," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the train station.
That didn't excite anybody.
There the brakes stopped, and the wagons snapped.
It was pure railway.
Statements that are symbolically urgent for Dinkel's homeland.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which after an increase of about 220 meters altitude has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, former pull and push-blocks were needed that had their homeland in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway plant with 21 locomotives, apprenticeships, driving and train championships.
"The heartpiece was the hub that had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years professional railway driver.
The BW Pressig railway plant, which was under construction in 1968, also operated locomotives for the side routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "People's Sheet" reported of a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Eloks were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the 1939 line already minimized the need for pull and push-blocks.
From 1977 they were only used in freight trains.
Up to 1991 at least 10 000 scales have been drawn in the month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were broken down, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that one has not envisaged a better use of the site, even in terms of freight transport".
At Pentecost 1989 the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous railway festival in Pressig at the anniversary of "50 Years of Elektrification Nürnberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later on.
On 1 June 1991 the last 30 men were withdrawn, the ranger station Pressig was history.
"The rangers and obstacle bearings do the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Every misdeed would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led for the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current images are available here in the infrancenPlus article.
Kerber with start-up success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have already reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as Julia Görges did before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian named at number 13 gave up.
The Schwäbin now gets to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
Within the framework of the series "Kunst und Genuss" a special exhibition was opened on weekend in Mittelehrenbach.
Organizers and visitors registered with great ease looked at the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open area of the Dahlmann- Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and pleasure".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large visitor's license showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach.
The house owner Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He's been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who became the main organizer and artist as well.
A bit surprising, but some days ago, Hahn announced his resignation.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task in proven young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have been active in the past in the selection of artists and in the design of flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of art & enjoyment, there is again a 70 cent special stamp designed by them, available at each art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high success of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was able to be won for the musical arrangements.
In walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in play.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with coloured accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, visitors are expected on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree trunk, brightened in color, playfully furnished with 20 windshields, 24 hoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object seems fairytale and invites you to stay.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who prefers three-dimensional letters to devote 15 years of K&G to the event.
There are many parts in motion in the wind.
On half way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind of the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy-frame of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for skipping through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albachteners, too, at that time made their impatience air.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find themselves everywhere with the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should no longer be a Sanges life in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the tin bush they raised the MGV 68 Albachten from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting".
"It's going to be full today," H.E. Chairman Jürgen Holstihe guessed, and he should keep right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Especially for the anniversary they had revived the Foundation Festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball had been asked for festive clothing before.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as in the "House of Meeting", but were comfortably seated at tables.
In the meantime, movement was called for: DJ Matthias Drees from emergency tulin attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
The honor of the singers of MGV 68 Albachten made the voice sound.
In keeping with the occasion, happy songs were announced.
Almost already set: "So one day, as beautiful as today".
Suitable for the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
"Humulus lupulus" is the Latin term for "hopping" in alluding to another cool drink.
Again sovereign was the choir lead by Richard Homann, one of the five that were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstiffe: "He has such an easy way, it's a master achievement he's doing." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves in bed.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes mainly Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-known poetry.
There was also a large Tombola.
The proceeds are intended to finance a visit to the All-Wetterzoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The climber is marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite right in the league three.
No trace of shyness or fracks, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee quite well.
"That wasn't crystal clear, but we've already left an impression," says the relatively satisfied coach.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately said: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game stopped.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence the guests had a set ball.
"When they get to the finish, such a game can already kick," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full yield to its goal.
"All of us are aware of who stands in such a derby on the other side.
It doesn't break our necks.
I've seen really good volleyball in phases," Annacker didn't argue with the 0:3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey for the Independents goes, after just three days of playing seems not to be possible.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball." In the fourth league, they don't want to look down anyway.
If the vests are not soiled in the next few weeks, they must look upwards.
A first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday, you can only go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on October 14th.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Dreamship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly speaks that the series might have had a co-inflict on her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left the ship forever.
The series that made her star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, travelled with a suitcase around the world alone and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level," says Keller in conversation with the "image on Sunday".
First of all, she was only "the woman of Hans von Borsody", but this changed with the "Dreamship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"If he liked it so well, I don't know."
She considers it possible that her husband might have been jealous at that time, but "how many men hated Hans' conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only one right and he wanted to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed my mind," she explains further.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, who I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could happen a second time too."
The day before the public ceremony, I sat in the closet crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller presented himself to love "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not available every day.
I went too naively to love".
The night-folder, who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ resort Zurich, has ventured to the ZFF opening party this time.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little lightly.
And the glaring shine in which a green carpet is immersed in the six-speak place, hides it for a fee.
But it's a film festival, as more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
On this late Thursday evening, he dries over the square to make it easier in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
The public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, is called so.The demand institute in the part of a new pavilion is much more difficult to pour out a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests who have just had the best chat in the cinema next door to the opening movie "Green Book" celebrate the start of the festival each year with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: The works shown come from all over the world.
What you don't have to think of in an article about this festival, so that you don't fall into hive advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a little bit around the fetters, which have put a good fairy on him, and two cocky doorkeepers actually generously wave him in.
Inside, the invited, they dance far after midnight to live music, or can be portrayed by DJ rhythms to which they shout at each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite hips.
In the delicatessen shop in the Souterrain, oysters wait for sloping mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut up, a chocolate fountain sprung.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The moth studies the sign at the escalator: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If that's two separate instructions, he's got torn up in the dress code.
But it's more of a conditional construction, and it certainly has saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry tilts a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", appropriate to the festival award.
The price of the best drink is not necessarily the result of this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents himself.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for the said brand for years, is not here that night.
But there is a face passing through, between local celebrity, cashier's table and kitchen articles, which is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
His main actor shouldn't be far.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty almost like a choir boy, walks through the crowd.
He's not bewitched, he's not done, he's not done, he's not done, he's done, he's done, he's done, he's done, he's done, he's done, he's done, he's done, he's done, he's done, he's done, he's done, he
Especially for this restraint, like misunderstandings, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumba dances
Trainer and ex-footballstar Diego Maradona is looking forward to the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the Cumba rhythm cabin, as shown in a video published on Saturday.
In the 15th-century clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fired by the players.

Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send after last-minute break "on the ground destroyed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball leagueist ASV send, could hardly grasp it: "So a bitter defeat". His protectors were "destructed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Obituaries - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played well - as in stone hedges, as against Höllhorst - over long phases, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we have completely slept", the ASV trainer got angry.
At 8:1, the housekeepers quickly also carried out the early break that Bieletzki had taken, but at first they did not have any fruit.
"Then suddenly a rucksack went through the team," bieletzki summarized the second quarter of the hour.
For the break, the residue was only two goals.
Above all, sending's best, Marius Hintze, met in the phase again and again.
From a visitor’s point of view, it became even better after the change.
After 33 minutes David Ernst looked like 15:15, after which the season changer was almost continuous.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly soothing three hits (29:26).
And then?
Grab the impartial into action.
Bieletzki usually takes care of looking for the guilt among others.
But: The 120-second time penalty Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke."
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought great, well stood up against seven men in the back and always thrown at the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now we have to get a fucking victory," says the restless guy, Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schögel (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Bavaria: woman has been missing for 30 years - police digs after body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the woman's mortal remains.
On Saturday, forces dig up a road near Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the street coverings and several layers were removed, such as the police and the public prosecutor's report.
According to new findings, the missing person may not have been buried far from his home.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The investigators also did not exclude a crime at that time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has been working closely with the Public Prosecutor's Office on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monumentary Authority, the investigators encountered a ground radar under the road near Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials bound the place to a few metres.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers are lurking in the net.

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threat of dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and US Stock Exchange Supervision SEC contributed to a non-judicial dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost his licence to lead listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay 20 million dollars each, as well as Musk resigns for three years as Chairman, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Director.
He's allowed to stay on the board of directors.
In comparison, which neither must be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who is also head of SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at the stock market with more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk is not guilty
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7th, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter supporters, perhaps he would take the company off the stock market, paying 420 dollars per share, the financing was secured.
This would have resulted in a total of 72 billion dollars being assessed by Tesla.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla remained on the stock market.
Following the agreement, Tesla now needs to find a chairman from outside, hire two independent board members and establish a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

Shortly before the end, Sturridge released the Reds with a loop in the angle.
Since 1989, record champion Manchester United has been sliding deeper and deeper into the crisis after the worst start of the season.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United earned 1:3 (0:2) and remained only in the middle field with ten points after seven days of play.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions League match against FC Valencia on Tuesday.

Surveys: 46 percent want Merkel not to be a chancellor until 2021
After the Querelen of the past weeks, GroKo collects several survey estimates.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD for the first time in Emnid Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one meter to 17 per cent, the SPD gives a point and ends up at 16 per cent compared to last week.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If on Sunday's Bundestag election, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would only get 43 percent of the votes together, according to Emnid.
This means that the large coalition has currently lost the majority on Sunday's question at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The government parties consistently vote 43 to 45 per cent (Allensbach: 51 per cent).
Together, they received 53.4% at the 2017 Bundestag election.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also wide: the AfD, in several surveys the second-largest party, is 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieve votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left averages 10 percent, and the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, depending on the proportion of the vote, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2-3 percent upwards and downwards.
But also the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the Bundestag elections in 2017.
At present, only 48 percent of the citizens find Merkel the right person in the Chancellor's Office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only one second (50 percent) wishes that the large coalition will hold the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent is for a new election.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday there had been significant losses of popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also judge, split, whether Merkel should apply for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47% are against it.
In the case of the Union's supporters, 64 per cent therefore wish to apply, 35 per cent do not.
Aushang bei Aldi: Reduced price to love happiness
Is Aldi going to Tinder 2.0?
Who says in times of Tinder there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket, as a place for acquaintances, almost exudes anachronistic romanticism for the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts at the wühl table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is called to be less a contact, but rather a sneaky stock exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react, in the first message, not to talk around the hot stripe for long?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood-Lovestory-Potenzial has it when the happiness of love precedes an out-of-eye-lost-and-recovered plot.
If the guy also reports under the email address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de with his worshipers, then it sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consortia - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this ad in an Aldi-Filiale, unknown to us, that she will also find her dream man, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic powdered meat".
She definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood for believing in the magic of analogue learning.

Football: Reus and Zorc demand rest for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion on the shape and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And we're not doing well," said Reus, a friend of God, after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not a simple situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry when negotiating with Hecking

Football: District league: Researchers appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch and his men went to court hard.
Wortkarg, coach of football district team VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (innerly) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
It's all history.
In the meantime, it is again running around the Firehoveweg.
Taufrischer Bericht is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past season only thinly past the ascent.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetch praised his boys and looked up every single one of them to simply say "Thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly went over to a 4-2-3-1 where Niklas Thewes waited in front of balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), the intercessed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
This would almost have happened when the SCA in minute 41 attacked Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbauner dangerously in front of the Wolbeck box at the same time as twice in person - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL failed to take full control.
Thewes of 18 meters failed almost.
Schroer also got too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes release.
With the intrusion of Miles Geske, Fütsch on the left missed another fresh cell cure.
When Old Rhine Chris Naberbauer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free throw for the placekeepers 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The foaled man came in himself and demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues" Thing with the right drop hit the bottom left from the perspective of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes to be damned long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penitentiary in the 80th minute unhappyly.
Arbitrator Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bang minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske in the 87th minute from twelve meters had still the win hit on the puzzle.
Could have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
On landing, there was an accident on the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At 2 p.m. on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn, a drama came about.
When a helicopter landed, there were turbulences, as the police confirmed against oe24.
The heli was captured by a wind farm, pushed on the ground and came to be lost side by side.
The police, rescue and fire department were immediately contacted.
With a big bid, the forces came to the scene of the accident.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of investigations.
According to firefighter Franz Resperger, a small fire came into being, but it could be quickly deleted again.
Allbright Foundation Report: Women remain rare in corporate boards
Thus, only 8 percent of the executives were female on the date of the deadline of 1 September, as is apparent from the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied management teams - with few exceptions - were no longer conceivable.
The backlog makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and forward-looking.
It's another corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchanges was also due to positive impulses among the enterprises of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of executives are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 per cent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - in recent years pioneers - the proportion of women stagnated.
Last time, 26 women worked in the Boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest," Ankeren said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the proportion of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture is given by the supervisory boards: on 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 men less than a year ago.
"Every year, if the same number of women were recruited for the executive board, 40 percent would have already been reached in 2023," the report says.
Some even make men: luxury carrots: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each sold Ferrari and make 69,000 euros of operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble suppliers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and business professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer addressed this question.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made in the first half of the year with every car sold 69.000 euros operating profit - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley put on strongly even with every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

The chairman of the Tourist Association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Wine Princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already pompous tent. "It's 60 years to set up something like this - it's an amazing achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of this," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Weinprincessin Lisa II later came out symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"Beautiful that again so many have found the way to us after the abject wind." Later, "The Troglaures" caused a mood.
On Sunday, when the Abtwinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the prices of drinks in the afternoon as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary.
A celebration evening at the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, 5 October, in the guest's house, before going to the second round in the festival tent one day later.
In Bonn: Emergency medical car power in taxi
An emergency medical car is severely damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passerby has been fatally injured in the collision of the operational vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - best save human lives.
Such a rescue trip took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian in Bonn has been fatally injured in the collision of an emergency medical car with a taxi.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency medical car had passed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then ran into a crossing with the taxi that was driving at Green.
After the collision, the doctor's car sank against a lamp mast and a tree.
He recorded the passerine who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the emergency medical car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and driver of the emergency medical car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be released from duty.
The seriously injured 29-year-old emergency doctor was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could not help her anymore.
Another emergency doctor called in to try this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
In the 7th round of the Premier League, Manchester United will be out of the league.
Against West Ham United ManU 1:3 is subject to the way of defeat should still speak.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute when Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly brought the Red Devils back into play.
As they suspected an off-side at Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's defensive players stopped, and Arnautovic had all the time of the world pass the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative highlight of a previously insufficient performance over long distances.
The mood at Uniteds Manchester City is quite different.
The citizens trained by Mourinho's major competitor Pep Guardiola came to an approximate 2:0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the outer side of the guard for the first time for the home team.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalie, ensured the sixth win in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1:1 match against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League three days after the 1:2 defeat in the league.
As with the Cup-Out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the end of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, barely missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his sneaker.
Thus, after the Reds started with an impeccable balance in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the remiss in the league the Blues Liverpool now also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London town clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2:0 victories.
The Gunner fans, during which Granit Xhaka performed, had to wait for a success message against the surprise team from County Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defenseman Craig Cathcart unluckyly gave Alex Iwobi to his own goal, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil took the decision with his third hit.
Arsenal passed Watford thanks to the fifth consecutive victory and is again behind the big rival Tottenham in rank 5. A strong impression left behind by climbers Wolverhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten at 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and prove the 8th place.
VW brand missing: Paris Motor Show in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic but ubiquitous: The Diesel scandal and the ringing for driving bans and retrofitting should not let the German car companies go even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show they will be showing their new features from next week along with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn't really play a big role anymore.
The possible replacement and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which until then are still to be negotiated with the Berlin government, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the shiny backdrops of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and include their first pure electric models: Ingolstadter's e-tron is expected to be on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
But both were officially presented.
The iNext of BMW is due to start only in 2021.
The new 3er is at the heart of Paris.
This year, from 4 to 14 October, more than 250 exhibitors will be present.
In addition to car companies, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in each of their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in a change with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
The severe earthquakes and the subsequent tsunami have killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport links are damaged, enormous damage has occurred.
After the quakes, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the coastal town of Palu.
It is feared that the number of victims will still rise significantly.
So far, the numbers are only from palu.
However, many other communities are affected - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
About 150 Bikers Celebrate Service in Werdohl
Motorrad-Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service with a helper team for the motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking on Sunday.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional Motorcycle Godship (MoGo) at Haus Nordhelle takes place on the last Sunday of a month.
The bikers celebrate the end of the season traditionally in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers gathered there on Sunday to do anything but ordinary worship.
From 10 a.m. on the Bolides had already been erected in front of the church's entrance portal.
At first, the biker's early laps were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a deep curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
During the biker service, the sermon was given by minister Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill was responsible for the musical underpainting.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill proposes rather poetic-stable tones," said minister Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novel in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Fuchtorfer Heimatvere has a big party: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual action day Borisch was active.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also attracted great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and showed his amazing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and filled them with apples in the great funnel.
With a little muscle force a finely crushed mass was removed from the apples.
Not many of the children could yet imagine how to become a tasty drink.
But they could also look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer for layer over one another, which looks a bit like heckselgut.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually went into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorfer Farmer also had already filled up specialities.
So he opened his "skatzkiste" and presented the latest spring whites to the older visitor.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was accordingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents met, while the children were not only able to follow the process of the apple press, but also discovered the built Hüpfburg for themselves.
Also actives of the Füchtorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged themselves in the framework of the festival and invited at some stations to short-term games.
In the coming year, the Heimatverein will also offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: finally it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with the fourth season race: "Crussed situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the 4th Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed pros from Hanover 96 and spoke to them courageously.
There were many positives to be seen in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "This is of course disappointing, because you always think a lot."
The still victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) joined, are down with two counters and are in their current constitution a descendant candidate.
On the other hand, Frankfurt celebrated the first home win of the season, led by the outstanding Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner ahead of 46,300 spectators, who advanced seven points in the middle of the table after the successful overall test for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome.
Croatia's vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive by the Hesse during his debut and never to get in the grip of Hanover's defense.
The storm, which was struck long after the World Cup, showed with its speed and persuasiveness why it is so valuable for harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan borrowed from Liverpool FC was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who started swinging.
Lucas Torró's (17th) headball, faked on the gate network, put the first risk.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term outcast Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the housekeepers almost necessarily fell and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball after a blocked corner in the penroom, Haller extended per head in front of the gate where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the French second league player AJ Auxerre who came in summer.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time, Haller adapted to his storm partner Rebic, who skipped well and left 96-torwart Michael Esser no chance.
In the half-time, Hannover-Coach's broad riders responded to the weak performance of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxony played a little more courageously forward, flamming ideas remained until shortly before the end, when the follow-up hit.
The Hesses were much more efficient there.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed across De Guzmán, which only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was for the Frankfurters against overt guests just playing, even Jovic met a minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes the party mile
Spices Despite cool temperatures there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter made it to the millions at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two strikes.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christen fest Saint-Kreuz-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14th or on Sunday after.
The festival service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year-old war and is supposed to have shot a Swedish soldier on whom the legend says he should have shot.
Then blood flowed from the wound of the shot.
This resulted in a large pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not completed until today, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, priest Adolf Buhl reminds us that the Cross is a sign of hope, of comfort and of life.
Despite the importance of the Gesinian parish, the divine service was badly visited.
After the service the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the Cross festival ended.
For many years the Catholic church choir has been inviting to the Catholic parish home for the worldly part of the festival.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty meals as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon the parish still offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until next year.
After some time has passed, the damage has been identified more precisely and the individual tenders have been more specifically prepared.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already exists a few years ago has become greater, but more has been found to be possible only by means of a scaffolding.
The floor plastering works have been completed, before the winter is expected to begin with the natural stone works and it is hoped that half of these works will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life support Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities at Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße "a very special house" will now be handed over to its destination - all those present agreed at the opening date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers, who have been living in the home of the Donau-Iller for some time already, depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Larger corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas, Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former US Army officer building was placed on the test bench for the inhabitants with cell phone cap: "The house had come into its years and no longer at its time," said Bader looking back.
In 2016, the excavators moved to tear the house down.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life help Danube-Iller opens a new home
Around 4.6 million euros invested in new construction.
The free state taxed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to Architect Bader, the construction works have remained within the planned framework - time and financial.
He was also thanked by the managing director of life support, Jürgen Heinz.
The gap between a barrier-free and fire-resistant design was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, Head of Social Administration of Schwaben District, also said: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need the help to be mobile."
Kreutmayer said that homeliness and functionality had been well combined.
And further, "the property in this situation is a real lucky case, because it can no longer be acquired in the present situation".
In total, the new dormitory on Münsterblickstraße on almost 1500 square meters offers space for 30 people with disabilities, who are divided into three residential groups.
Stolz is the Life Aid Director Heinz to the eleven full-time staff, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Swedish complains of differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, Deputy SPD Federal President Manuela Schwesig called on all compatriots not to face the disadvantage of East Germany.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "Dayspiegel on Sunday".
The aim must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It was unacceptable that East Germans, on average, worked longer than the people in Western Germany, but were 15 percent less paid.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after the German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this dirty dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongjang presented the South Korean President Moon Jae to two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office reported on Sunday, the two dogs, about a year old, reached their recipients on Thursday.
They then crossed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the "accommodation".
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the National Cultural Property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship event had been announced to the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean power master Kim Jong Un in Pjongjang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join in international sports competitions such as the Olympic Games 2020 and to apply jointly for the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri for rocket engines.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months now in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question in retrospect to the past hundred years.
It is quite different for Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archive, to say in the magnificent "Image Book" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New Week, New Chance for Government
Back to substantive work - this is the unofficial motto for the Great Coalition's work week beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU last did not swear mantra-like "return to substantive work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other employed citizens in that country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and material work, but be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself once again to its mission - to governing - then it should not now be held up with debate on concepts.
It may be Monday that the Union and the SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blows of the last few weeks.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to regularly convene this round to defuse conflicts at an early stage; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, conflict-affected issues are on the agenda again with the diesel retrofits and the labour law on immigration.
CSU-Minister of Transport Scheuer wants the car companies to get rid of the exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation for technical retrofitting of older diesel.
While an approach has been made over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned Act on Trade Force Immigration.
The SPD calls for a permanent perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or train.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "striking" of the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will again be disputes among coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same has joined forces with GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Fight is good.
Without dispute, a society of such diverse and sometimes contradictory interests does not advance.
But in order to be constructive, disputes must not again be built up for partetic reasons on the question of Being or non-being.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD should argue - but always have a view of the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and beneficial for many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the track change issue can be pragmatically clarified - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, that is why the people's parties must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hardinger
Minister at the Visier
Is the Ministry of Labour in breach of the applicable law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" her legislators had worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
At List-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is a surprise - she brings the matter now through a request to Parliament.
She assumes that "the Minister only expressed her enthusiasm for the use of her team and did not in any way announce violations of applicable service rights in the eyes of current cameras".
Nevertheless, they now have questions to be able to free Har tinger from "any suspicion".
Police are tearing up a street looking for women's leeks
Marxgrün - Lange didn't want the police to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is dug.
The route is still closed in the Marxgreen area until Monday.
Previously, the investigators had used an archaeology dog before.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was able to limit the relevant spot to a few metres together with its guide in multiple applications.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Upper Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the area of the said street piece.
For more than a year already, the Prosecutor's Office and the Criminal Police Court have been working on the missing case.
Again and again at Marxgrün a cycle path was blocked and studied with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that here, in the course of the new construction of the state road, Heike's body could have been locked up 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Crawalls in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be celebrated for the first time.
But it's already coming to Crawalls.
The Separatists did not forget to use the police in autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, there have been clashes between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, with paint powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3000 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honour their colleagues in a rally who were in the referendum in the polling stations that was considered illegal last year.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred at the time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the Separatists and Central State security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the 6,000 separatists would have tried by force to break the police chain, and called on officials, among other things, with colour bags and eggs.
Six persons were arrested, 24 others were slightly injured, and the authorities were called upon.
The independence referendum will be held on Monday for the first time.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid Catalonia had placed under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also sat abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the Separatist movement continue to sit in U-Haft.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government came into office in May, the administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Combined impotence: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-White Ahlen continues to move forward.
At FC Gütersloh it was only a 0:0 tie.
The final light and the third last they revealed 438 spectators in the Heidewald Stadium as aggregate impotence.
The first half was overshadowed by the entertainment factor.
If you wanted to get a beer or a roast sausage, you could do so without concern.
There was no danger of missing a goal opportunity, for there was virtually no one.
First shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the whole party in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only real - possibility had the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling to go to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty zone.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Sturm Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel, from 18 meters, almost aimed over the housing and after an hour, the Güterslowers also appeared for the first time offensively.
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The fast-tracked account about Sinan Aygün "wrong" Nick Flock (62.) with a shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball by ex-Ahlenian Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mutzel (70.).
It did - nothing.
The Ahlenians did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but neither did she.
Angelo Daut then tried to remove the positive: "I like that we played at zero." But unfortunately, the zero stood at the front too.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as we were against Holzwickede and even though our opponent didn't want to play with us," RW Ahlen's interim trainer said.
Offensively "plaggered everything so much" against a team, "that just wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel we could get a counter-gate," says Daut.
To his suffering, however, one did not feel as if his team could shoot a goal as a spectator.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Harvesting Dank Market: Fortunately, there are enough Kreimers
The happy Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld table output point for which these donations are intended.
The honorary officials assure us: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening the sky was shining blue, the place was still a little empty, but this should change over the day.
Because: "It's so nice here, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a decent touch of humor.
In the short term, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer joined the Brockmann couple, who were supposed to be balanced against food.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replace" did not allow itself to be used in between musically to entertain the ever-increasing number of visitors.
This happened so well that some folk songs were sung later on.
"Just great", Marcel Kreimer was pleased.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many actives with their stands, among them mostly clubs.
"In fact, there shouldn't be something like a table," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the deployment of all those who were working at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful paint - here goes what.
Then the Maykranze was taken down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarters.
At many booths was worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, was creative at his decupier saw.
Furnished works, beer lid with blanket motifs and a lot more he had on offer.
One specialty offered three beekeepers: "Beekeeper honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Bushschlüter.
The latter has a speciality.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Since the little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so well.
The sociality is what allowed the visitors to stay long until evening hours, even without a stage program that there is no such thing at the Autumn Festival.
Lubricating with local political message: No successful advertising for skates
In Lengerich, unknown people have tried in a hardly any way to promote the construction of a skate system.
At several places there are similar lubricants, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" were spelled on signs, among others, at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the professional election fair on September 19 a corresponding lettering on the advertising sign had been discovered on the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with a edding at that time, it could have been removed easily.
"But a few days later it was back, this time it was sprayed up," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given in this particular case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the table.
If the skate system is built, its realization is also to be made possible by sponsors.
Commitments already exist, explained Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal department of school, sport and culture, without name to name.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the embroidered board.
For years, local policy and administration have been dealing with the issue of skates.
After the old one at the LWL clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
In the end, the Council voted in favour of the fire-fighting park.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction in this place.
A turnaround followed at the end of June.
The members of the Main Committee and the Finance Committee voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word was then given to the City Council.
He is going out of a decision this year, so that a positive vote for 2019 could be built.
Engpass in air traffic security is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg Following the European air traffic chaos in summer, German air traffic controllers will not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," said Matthias Maas, head of the Air Safety Union, the German press agency at the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
One important reason for the numerous delays and failures in flight is the long-known human needs of European air traffic controllers, for which there is no quick solution.
" Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," the trade union said.
The market for fully trained pilots was empty throughout Europe.
In the center of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
In Hanseatic City, representatives of the federal, state, air traffic management, airlines and airports meet on Friday to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compaction and overtime, this will not happen without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German air traffic control company.
Maas once again made the EU Commission responsible for the Lotsen Misere.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting costs and staff savings in the national air navigation services are now fully related to the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to use regulations in Brussels that "do not further cut the air".
At present, the EU's requirements would be voted on by 2024 and further tightening was to be feared.
The EU is under constant lobby printing by airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now reap exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high cost of delay would lead to a rethinking of the airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offered a "voting and future pact", said Maas.
So far, 120 pilot students announced every year over the next five years are just enough to compensate for the age-related exits.
The necessary staff is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees on group restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to rebuild the Group.
According to Thyssenkrupp Interim Manager Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisising Group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are supposed to have their headquarters in Essen and to be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two resignations, the control body counts only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
Among other things, the new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to contain the 50% share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG the business is to be bundled with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demos by police officers and Catalan independence advocates.
At two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, some 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a big bid to keep the two lines of protest from each other.
According to the forces, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security lock.
They'd have attacked the officers with paint and throwing shots.
According to the evidence, there were also among the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue staff, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and peer assessment
With their demonstration, the police wanted to praise the colleagues who had taken action almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt as a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona only.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name to Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who only did their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues were "not coming to provoke," the police assured.
Panne Allowed Access to Personal Data by British Minister
A security gap in a mobile app has led to the personal data of ministers and members of the Conservative British Tory Party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the Panne became known one day before the Tory party in Birmingham.
Two people mounted on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hannover Police reported a serious traffic accident on Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.

Football: Juve Trainer praises to top score: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star storm had "played the best game this evening together with half an hour of Valencia," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive bought star was also the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and does well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three gate templates, Juve turned the game after the early setback due to the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hanged the poorest persecutor for the time being.
The goal hunter from Real Madrid first laid up the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by headball, also made the preliminary work for defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who only had to push in shortly before the gate line.
"There are many templates," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see gates from the attacker, who is the record goalie in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get even better at serving him," the coach asked.
Best Juve driver is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' superiority seems to be even more pressing.
Seven wins in seven games is the impeccable series in Series A. At 21 points the master of the past seven years already has six counters lead on Naples.
The second table, which was trained by the former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not unlucky against Turin.
But at the latest after the appointment of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to get too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red of the place.
"We played well against a good Naples," said the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel there.
The German national player has won over Juve.
The professional from FC Liverpool was in use in all seven leagues.
The middle field player also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the square at the 2:0 victory of the Turiners and was closed for the home game against Young Boys Bern on Tuesday.
Kanye West changes his name
Rapper Kanye West has been paying attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" during the weekend with a particularly squeaky appearance.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided the viewers with runners and question marks.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name for the release of his new album on time.
From now on, you can only call him "Ye", the musician says.
"The being that used to be known as Kanye West," he tweeted in opposition to the late singer Prince when he laid down his artist's name.
The pseudonym, however, is no news.
The tenth album was already released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you"," says the rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage did not make a hooligan out of his disappointment.
This was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was simply more gripping, we've put him in trouble as well as never before." Accordingly thinly read the list of Hotmarer shooting possibilities.
Grade two goals in 90 minutes, so you can rarely make games positive.
Football Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first pass, but the first used Maik Krause from a pointed angle to the early guide (7.).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preparation by Krause, he turned into a free standing.
The hosts had only one double possibility when Moritz Höne initially failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all gave up.
Furthermore, Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use a measuring meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the gate line and saw red for it (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide hit the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had previously criticized ourselves hard, which was different today than in the past weeks," said the conclusion of Florian Kraus.
Sendhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Gate: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't even know what to like about it," he said.
"We don't have access to them at all." With that, he probably meant the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably all the other green-whites that appeared with collective offensive force.
Nevertheless, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, twirling cheeky and drawn from his players, on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class retention.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"This was by far our best seasonal performance," he says.
"How we get back after the 0:2, how we keep against one of the top teams in the league over the entire season, that was really phenomenal".
So bitterly it seems that you have to go home with empty hands.
Top-door hunter Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season hit (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side pattern valid for Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"That was already insane what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent in vain.
Shortly before the change of sides his own Elf managed to compensate: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe through to the long Toreck (45.).
After the side change, it was McGill again, who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-laden game.
Nübel again shocked Albachten (64), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69).
Despite overnumber, Albersloh no longer managed to counter the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against sheepdets, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolf, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Busse (87. Bareksai).
Gates: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Frühning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually made three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and ended up playing 0:0.
Media: Whole Bureau resigned from Dynamo Dresden
According to media reports, the entire bureau of football bilegist Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media called for a joint letter from the Saxony panel.
At first there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is to be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
Good thing he's gone again.
There are few public guests whose departure to Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had said he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
France's President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to pick up the prize for tolerance personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, his term of office was too short: as President of the Federal Republic, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was there.
For example, Academy Director Udo Hahn, when he proudly said, "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were with us already." The fact that prominent figures appeared at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic at the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October Liedermacher Konstantin Wecker takes part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, on September 29th, the writer Frido Mann is attending a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to receive the "Tolerance Prize" given to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television moderator Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The around 80 meetings up to the middle of 2019 have brought about.
"The pension is not sure!" is in a conference title.
"SOS at the borders of Europe" - this is how the Academy describes the "risk and fatal route over the Mediterranean".
"And at a conference on Syria: "Barbaria without limit".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war spoils any human idea".
From structural racism in society to the gap between the rich and the poor to the radical change of work through digitalization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academy Director Hahn convinced himself: "Free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to seek solutions or at least partial solutions".
At a meeting on the 200th.
Karl Marx's birthday soon awaits a more visitor to the direction of capitalism-criticism, the others rather a tendency from "left to center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent daughter of the Evangelical State Church," said study manager Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
The musical cabaret with Tina Teubner was "suitable both for adults and men" on Friday evening in the hall of Christenkirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaretist, Teubner nodded to gender understanding, not only with humor and heartwarming for the (feeled) woman and the (feeled) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar set her and also mastered her violin.
Ben Sükrüp was sitting at the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes up with words even until the end of the sentence, on the other hand, a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanied Sükrüp Teubner, that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, that is, as it fit the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had put into play a paradox: satisfaction comes to the man if he has a partner, but he does not give up the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefits.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have come out of the composition of Mozart would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unexpectedly?
So Sükrüp slides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Head full of Blood and Wounds" to the "Lied of Death", and from Mozart's g minor symphony to a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
The chansonette, treasurer of the club, was handed over to Karlheinz Kleintje.
But the chairman, Heidemarie Markenbeck, could not accept an additional thank you.
She had the idea to give the duo one in Wolbeck, next to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police slightly corrected the number of victims down.
It would have been a slight injury to 10 passengers instead of 15.
All of them were released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in the hospital for one night to observe.
He will be released during the day, said a spokesman to the police.
The cause of the long-distance bus accident at Bruchsal was still unclear.
The long-distance bus was continuously frontal on Saturday morning against a control board.
Handball: Damen-Landesliga: Ahlener SG retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenians had problems mainly with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who only scored ten hits.
"In fact, I was very satisfied with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We didn't get to grips with them," said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many opportunities left out.
The concentration in the end left his team missing this time.
As a result, the ASG ran behind almost to the end of a backlog, lay behind the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.).
Only towards the end did the wider bank of the host women make a decisive difference.
In addition, Aydogdu presented Merle Klement backroom on the left, which then made "extrem clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Busches, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschkopf (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd league Women: BSV Ostbevern's top performance at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the BSV Ostbevern volleyball players have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd league West.
At the second VC Allbau Essen, the Blue and Whites won at 3:1.
"This was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked on this," said coach Dominik Münch, looking forward to an almost impeccable performance of his team at the crashed table leader.
The guests almost dominated the first passage as desired.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice-master of the previous year at 25:15.
Food has been accepted in two bars, but has not come into play.
We've done it well.
Our opponent has opened up at high risk, but also produced some tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led at 12:8. "Eating has changed the assumption to three bars.
We couldn't hold the shock pressure.
Food has sucked up, and we've let ourselves get a little bit in the air," continues Münch.
At 18:17, the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their noses on.
Even though East Bevern defeated four sets of balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a better class," the training manager found at the rising level.
Mike Rüdingloh and Wiebke Silge, in conclusion, contributed significantly to the BSV turning the leaf in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "There we played consistently and quietly".
About 7:3 and 15:13 the Blue and White passage brought four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but also Maren Flachmeier had caught an excellent day.
BSV-Women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) criticised the way in which the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the great Ditib mosque in Cologne.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left a pile of cracks in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be used in a difficult way," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides would have missed the chance to have a common, reconciled appearance.
"Instead of stressing the Muslim affiliation to Germany with top German politicians, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The broad exclusion of the German public has "enhanced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break is finally folk date time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottun already organizes its fifth Nottun folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost to the day exactly then it was a year ago that we held a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn't have thought that our folk meeting would be so fast in emergency.
No matter if Stormtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the official was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next folk meeting is like always a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and seaman songs, folk songs, Evergreens and old drummers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites friends of musicians after emergency.
Klaus Spellmeyer promised his accordion for the first Folktreff" birthday.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with flat German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folktreff Emsdette with his international version of the song "Frösche in der Nacht" inspired the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend once again a cosy and humorous evening," says the home club's invitation.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to be active is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always fast, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The folk meeting starts at 7:30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step on the way to the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority had approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
As a result, approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest obstacle - in the United States are still open for the billions of dollars.
Finally, one insider's consent had improved because Linde promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October so that the merger succeeds.
From pure fruit production to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle the 125-year-old existence of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landpflege was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinhaus, the last foundation impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set up, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a large anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
In 1893 he was named "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach City and Land).
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually about the fruit-growing, about flowers and gardening at that time nobody thought about it.
"At that time, in the epoch of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Kreisheimatführer Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees should sow long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens were built at schools.
The fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 horticulture associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is not exhausted by far.
Natural horticulture, organic plant protection, village decoration and nutrition play an as important role as the dissemination of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the youth group Hutschdorfer Jugendgruppe "Maulwrufe" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said District Chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The collection of chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect similar joy with Smartphone & Co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are supposed to stand, the district association decides," added Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district left no doubt about it, as did the district managing director and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He conducted the many visitors with a presentation of the long history of the circle association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Everything came out of the garden before, and for the winter, it was ingested.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden had turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has existed, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the specialist pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to allow our homeland to remain beautiful and viable.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our associations, the President of the Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl, added.
"We have to stop the sharp decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the towers of the Musikverein Thurnau.

Priority at Nafta talks: Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs is devoting UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on the issue of Nafta: they are putting both trading partners into an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and shifts her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure when the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) was reopened with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of speaking only on Monday before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, the minister told her speaker Adam Austen.
In the meantime, it focuses on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Minister for Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo had declared on Friday that the negotiating leaders of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between its country and the United States.
The US and Mexico agreed in August on a recast of the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
Until Sunday evening (local time) they are to be concluded, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the U.S. Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure to negotiate, Mexico's President, Andres Manuel López Obrador, had announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against President Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a trade fair attack, left the hospital.
The ex-military on the right wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro after a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo", where he lived.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician had been attacked on the open road at the beginning of September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile in several Brazilian cities thousands of people went to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not") women's organisations had called for protests against the ex-military.
The associations against Bolsonaros also made racist and women-deficient statements mobile in the social networks.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the São Paulo economic metropolis.
In the capital Brazil, the protests were mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He was replaced by former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and therefore not allowed to apply.
The presidential election in Brazil will take place on 7 October.
As former mayor of the million city of São Paulo, Haddad was in polls far behind the far right candidate Bolsonaro.
Although Brazil's "Trump" has been involved in political activity for a long time, it has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reaches the absolute majority in the first round of the elections, there will be a final election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known to be in awe of homosexuals and blacks and to glorify the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He always shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the followers of Lula's left-wing workers' party should be shot.

After long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 years after long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen reported on Larsen's website.
On the deathbed Larsen had been surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which in the 1970s was hugely successful in Scandinavia.
Her songs were influenced by international music such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
Larsen was successful as a solo artist following the dissolution of the band in 1978.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om Natten" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as "Straßenjungen", who "was against everything, but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared on the 70th birthday of Danish queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger."Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a description of the rock live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock of three other friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly see the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince for the start of the concert evening also with the latest unknown pieces from his own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to a consistent and powerful interaction.
Although "Addition" calls are not to be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" is left to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hard rock is not the same hard rock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is used in addition to guitar rock at "Here We Stand".
Not only the longing, straight ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates through the transition from melodic passages to the guitar-laden rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishüber has, however, since its inception in 2005, gained a special level of awareness.
The band presents their hard rock on Saturday with full agility.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China of 2017 - has special stage experience is obvious and unheard of.
In collaboration with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
The sound feels even higher out of control than before by guitarist Norbert Brinkmann while he delivers a celebrated solo, where he runs through the audience.
A certain volume belongs, of course, to this kind of hard rock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito"- Rocknacht, according to the information of the Mischpult team at the three-year concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" lies at about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the air hammer level, but is still clearly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", which indicates "The Ignition" on their website.
Ear-dipping 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume as usual with the annual metal station dichein in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need at this rock night.
After almost four hours the three bands of the tougher, rocky gang type have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saws and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, although in the transmitted sense, can say in the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead man in a sailing accident at Essen/Mülheim airport
There was a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen airport.
A sailing plane crashed on Sunday in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
As reported by the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung", a sailplane was crashed at the exhibition park at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, the flight student was on board alone - the pilot is supposed to be a resident.
The plane was already on the landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance from a fixed tent on the airport site.
But since this weekend, there has been a Oktoberfest.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhr District Cities and directly at the entrance to motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at major events at the Essen fair or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
And then we fell in love.
The fact that the President of North Korea, in spite of the nuclear crisis, is well-meaning is no secret.
Now Trump has made a true declaration of love to his colleague.
She also has to do with Kim's beautiful letters.
At the age of 72, the married president of the United States has become a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean powermaker Kim Jong Un.
In front of followers in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old spross of the reigning dynasty from Pyongyang, although in the ring around North Korea he proves to be quite tough.
"I was very hard on him, too, and it went back and forth between us," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics of them have so far seen little more than lip confessions.
That the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" of his martial threat - so Trump's nickname for Kim - should not be for everyone, seemed quite conscious of the US President.
At any rate, he took the expected criticism of this in his appearance in a large sports hall in Wheeling City just ahead of him: "Donald Trump says they fell in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidious.
But don't take care of him very much, Trump explained and then pointed his finger at the crowd: "I've always told you it's so easy to be presidious."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there rushing into this crowded arena, but we'd only be 200 people out there.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens visited, atmosphericly as well as at the top spoiled by sun sat: Very varied and with a good shot October festival flair Baesweiler cleaned himself out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not just take place in the tent at the fire brigade tower, but was extended from the trade association to the city on Sunday.
Refugees saved through video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their disastrous detention conditions in Libya with the help of a cell phone video and thus enabled their rescue.
The group had shot and distributed the admission in their cell in the coastal city of Saviwa in July at risk of life.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors were alarmed by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya trying to get to Europe via the Mediterranean.
With the video he put himself in danger of life, according to his own statement.
One of his associates had been beaten almost to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally, the conditions of detention had been disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
This year, some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homeland with the help of the programme, said Jorge Galindo, the IOM spokesman in the West African country.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard from a phone caller so far.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is dominated to large parts of militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to primary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
Around 16:50 the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front of the 1st floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a ladder into the ground floor or the front.
The teacher contacted the police who took the investigation.
Whether or not things have been stolen can't be said yet.
Description: 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the Obernberg police inspectorate at the Inn, phone number 059 133 4244.
German was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central France after he had stuck the car away from all the forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces discovered the car on Saturday afternoon by chance near a pasture and freed the missing one since Tuesday evening, the police reported on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reported to have been in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home now.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his field car over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search, the man's whereabouts remained unclear for days.
Laschet encourages the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) reminded Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own information, of the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries were currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns mainly waves of arrest, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He had therefore made it clear at Erdogan "that if relations are to become normal in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this".
According to his own information, Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He had formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's readiness to fly at Cologne Airport in the short term.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected it on the basis of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in the United States: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of highlighting the success of the negotiations on the denucleization of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more sober than ever.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's presence.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations on an nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The recent halt is that the US is building on forced action that is deadly for confidence building," said Ri in New York.
In these circumstances, disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there will be no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean Chief Diplomat explained.
The fact that sanctions could force North Korea on the "knee" is "a dream of people who do not know us".
However, in order to build confidence, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri pointed out.
On the US side, however, there had been no "corresponding reactions", the minister criticised.
On the basis of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council alone decided three times last year on sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his foreign minister Mike Pompeo have urged the United Nations to comply strictly with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on a rapprochement.
In June Trump met Kim Jong Un, who was the first North Korean leader.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October Pompeo is to return to Pyongyang to talk about the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
The fact that they were actually at a youth meeting did not help many visitors to the house of the open door HoT: White blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the harvest thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves for the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the director of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power failure had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start from the beginning again: although we have received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, the children and young people wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's how everyone packed up.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Better it can't cook," praised a visitor impressed, while Hokkaido soup was served or the guests were allowed to serve Quiche, Liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people put on their feet," stressed pastor Frank Beckmann, while sorcerer Stephan Lammen, with card tricks and other pieces of art, was astounding.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW National Board
Out of frustration about criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen Table, Jörg Sartor, gave his post in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen table had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as vice president of the NRW panels in July, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
Too many have fallen into my back.
The head of NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, spoke about the dpa's understanding of the decision of his long-standing alternate.
The sharp criticism has taken Sartor with him.
"I can understand his step - people who didn't know exactly why the Essen table is doing this have expressed themselves."
Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "Six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
In turn, Sartor criticised colleagues from other boards in the "World on Sunday".
One should not follow the approach, "without us the people in the city starve".
It was up to the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm being told too much sweetness," he said.
There are these whole social fuzzis who criticized me at the time.

Against this, Werder Bremen decimated against Milos Veljkovic because of a yellow-red card already before the break, the Stuttgarters had to fear in the meantime.

Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, some 1.8 million people today voted to change the name of their country to northern Macedonia.
In one case, the almost three decades of floating conflict with the neighbor of Greece could be solved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach to Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on the future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become NATO member at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in U-Haft.
The refugee attacked three women.
One Syrian brutally beaten three pensioners and hurt them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum-seeker had ran into Alsergrund at around 10:00 p.m. on Friday.

He also stepped the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered haematomas, bruises, and concussions.

He was taken to the hospital and continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes word on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" newspaper.
"If we get married, he's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD federal party and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had agitated a Wutrede on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stuck" himself on the subject.
"This was your Shabowski moment," he said in an allusion to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to enter into their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example under the right of adoption.
Garden day: cut 400 meters hedge
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the citizens' association Children's House and the Society for Leprosy.
For about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to the factory for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, Chairman of the Federation of Citizens.
And there have also been some gatherings.
Because of the hot summer, we are late this time, but fortunately it is now just a cut of shapes.
Because already in spring, you have shaved the hedge once.
The breakfast that is always followed by the work also has a long tradition.
"We should keep everyone strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Canuslalom World Cup
The Augsburg Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the conclusion of the Canuslalom World Cup in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old spent a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympic track.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a century.
I was well prepared, had already had enough rides here on the plant and it was all right today," said London's third Olympia.
In the goal he threw away his paddle with joy and secured both arms to the height - knowing that it would be sufficient for at least one medal.
After all, he had a start number four.
But the six remaining starters were unable to peak his fable time of 89.69 seconds.

Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what breakers want to make use of again.
The police inspector Gauting mentioned yesterday the first attempt to break in this fall.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it remained on the Königswieser Straße during the attempt at the family house.
They started when the perpetrators put their hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised her so much that she took flight without a prey.

Obituaries at Hertha: Collected from reality: Bavaria vs. Ajax demanded
The title is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin is not intended to let FC Bayern fall.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small part of the performance under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase to a larger autumn depth for the Munichers.
"A week ago you had the impression that we are invincible.
Now we got a little bit of reality," said Thomas Müller after the earned 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows we're really upset, and that's why we're going to give us a little gas on Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year outside, no goal was set, like at the same time of the preseason two mandatory games in series without victory, the table lead in the football league lost to Borussia Dortmund for the first time.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must still be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle-stitches over the outside have delivered just two blue breaks within three days, as the most overwhelming Bavarias are to be cracked.
"The people who know FC Bayern know that we won't let this happen and we'll do everything we can to get back to success," said Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he and his losers in his city of birth turned surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only to the once again poor handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless result in the first conclusion of his term of office before the break of the country – otherwise the tone might increase.
Thus Kovac did not take any extraordinary action before the second royal class appearance of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second pre-rounding game against Ajax, which had also forced AEK Athens to the start, will begin with 3:0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will make our goals again," announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup finale against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke in particular clear text.
The lawyer acted as a warner.
"I don't think this is all bad, we have to work it out again, too, because we don't make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old emphasized shortly before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, Bavaria was already with five counts behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with a point lead.
And so Kimmich felt at least positively that the public debate on the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in shooting line: Özil-Causa: sharp attack from Erdogan on Grindel
With heavy accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees errors, but defends the association line.
A new post should now be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for clarity in the permanent dispute theme Mesut Özil.
After the President of Turkey strongly criticised the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany at the opening of the major Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, the personally violently attacked Grindel in the Mainz ZDF "Sportstudio" announced the consequences of the causa.
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migrant background in the U-teams - that something like this is not repeated," the 57-year-old said and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration commissioner.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan was not in favour of the values of football and the DFB.
In sharp words, he had denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil and our Ilkay, born and raised in Germany.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the cathedral city.
To be honest, I couldn't digest it as her president that our two young men, who have gone up to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt that he had "treated the DFB in the future" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with photos of the two.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to stand in front of players in the future.
That someone says that if I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm Migrant - I can't.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I've always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for a return of Özils to the national team.
As a result, next to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration representative will be appointed.
"If one has a clear impact on society and football without a migration background and says, "The topic is important, we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the ground where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to re-apply as DFB President for the office next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Yearly builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the pensioner that he had been driving against her car.
However, there was no personal exchange since the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone call about a car driver who had left the road and been driving against a control post.
Addressed to that, the man didn't want a police officer on site and then drove away.
After that, the Rödental drove home.
However, the pensioner has operated in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and at turning a construction vehicle.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made an impression and couldn't remember much.
The damage amounts to approximately 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 operational forces still in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a German military site in Emsland, 980 workers are still employed in the extinguishing work.
This was reported by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop in a stable manner, 70 volunteers were last withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of personnel was planned, it is said.
In the night to Sunday, an Earth fire had been discovered and deleted.
Last week the disaster had been lifted, which was declared well a week earlier on September 21 because it had been feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements in danger by wind and sparks.
On Thursday, it was said that overcoming the fire in adjacent communities would no longer be a threat.
In time, more than 1500 local forces tried to control the large fire.
The Luftwaffe continues to support the work at the Bundeswehrtestgebiet near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones from the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also scheduled for October 2nd and 5th.
The fire had been triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrands was temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometers over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point to receive claims for damages.
First claims for compensation had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
After her wedding, Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde left the main church of St. Catherine in Hamburg.
Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the politician married his long-standing friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave themselves the yes word on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" newspaper.
If we get married, that's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budgetary spokesman of the SPD federal party and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had agitated a Wutrede on 30 June 2017.
For example, he had accused Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stuck" himself on the subject.
"This was your Shabowski moment," he said in an allusion to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the GDR border opening.
Since 1 October 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to enter into their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example under the right of adoption.
referendum in Macedonia on new state names started
In Macedonia, the highly anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
About 1.8 million voters are supposed to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the neighbouring Greece of the same name.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they also give the start for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have become 90 years old on September 30.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner of 1986 dies in the United States in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the fear of the Shoah for the posterity of the world.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The purpose of the register is to facilitate organ donation and relieve members of stress.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve members of stress situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
If necessary, your wishes can be obtained from Swisstransplant.
The new procedure does not alter the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with express consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the SwissTransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases will a card be found at the crucial moment in case of possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations the relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"They must then decide vice versa in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Ever.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesman of the Federal Office for Health Information says, Marita Völker-Albert.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - pro or counter organ donation -," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has voted in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered an organ donor, unless he or she objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is a world champion in headcounting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in headcounting.
On the weekend in Wolfsburg he fought against 39 competitors.
Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, announced this on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organises the competition every two years.
Previous tasks included: 14,130,214 x 17,981.822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448.333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants arrived against guests from the audience with a pocket calculator.
Wenzel greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was present in Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old.
With terms like superbrain, genius or miracle child, organiser Laue can not begin much.
"Coupling can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-oriented computing competitions.
Disciplinaries include, for example, square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, too, the Germans would have good opportunities, the main referee said.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because in early childhood headcounting is learned more intensely and with other effective methods.
Intrusive appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about early detection of breast cancer
Tennis Ass Serena Williams shows off her sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point to breast cancer with this video and make himself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divines" - only her hands cover her most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which deals with early detection of breast cancer, which can save lives.
Serena Williams would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
A emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were discovered in Serenas Lunge.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans a clear extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "symbol law" in review.
This will significantly extend the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains to the west
Ms. Holle will be shaking her beds in the west for the first time this week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit decreases at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it could snow down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity, it was said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, there should be new snow above 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 cm.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Tilmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become winterish.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual Knickpflege on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start the annual Knickpflege on Monday.
The "green walls" unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the low-forested federal state for around 200 years.
The tree and tree hedges, which are up to five metres wide, are "walterset" and the last retreat rooms for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were built on the basis of an order by the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, which ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limitation and livestock fence, they also provided the farmer with firewood and beams for their craft houses.
From that time also comes his name "Knick": By "knocking" the branches could develop the dense, intertwined boundaries.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, some 45,000 kilometres of hedges extend and give the image of a wooded, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by some 7000 species of animals as a spare habitat.
In one kilometer Knick could live up to 1800 different species and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise he takes care of a light line of trees, which in addition to biodiversity also reduces the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, carpentry may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesiaier talks about situation on site
In an interview with the editorial network Deutschland (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta right now on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport was closed on Palu at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be imported.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our World Vision office has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have housed other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills, on which they still endure fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people partially steal food and petrol.
The public service has been completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
Also a prison was destroyed, the prisoners run around partially freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island running?
At the moment we received cell phones, but before that it didn't work and we only got information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people, of whom they do not know if they are living and where they are staying, because people during the earthquakes were not at home, but, for example, on the way to work.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they have been turned on the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific ring of fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We normally know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to forgo Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo are missing from the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
On Saturday, Aogo had drawn a muscle fiber in the back left thigh at 2:1 against Werder Bremen, the football leagueman announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hanover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games even after the following national break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not report a forecast of the failure time.
A bundle of muscles usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber crack usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the film festival of San Sebastián, the festival of the most prestigious European festivals closes annually.
All songs on the cinema despite the fact that 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.

On Sunday morning, the Olching fire brigade tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action went on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - walkers on Lake Olchinger saw a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the area of the water station.
To help the animal, the passersby called the police and the fire department.
The first attempts to catch the duck, however, went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the forces again and again.
In the end she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the firefighter was able to circle the animal and push it back to land, where it was then inserted into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a hardened handle.
The duck injured in the chest was then taken to the animal clinic of the LMU to Oberschleißheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI scan at the turbo-tempo
The time is extremely short and the number of hearings planned is very limited.
With an FBI scan at the Turbotempo, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the thin majority for Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial about the necessity claims.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the suspected incidents that have been going on for more than 30 years.
The latest turn in the drama about the vocation of Kavanaugh accompanied by a cultural struggle had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing between Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer launched angry Tirads against the opposition Democrats, the Senate's Judicial Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the Supreme Court of the United States.
The majority of Republicans seemed secured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but requested an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still described the heavy demonstrations on Thursday as a "decision", initially contained further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of "Happy in Happiness".
In this way, he said, the last doubt could be solved.
Later Trump attacked the Democrats sharply in an election campaign because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump to order FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One will specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, no more, one government representative said to the Wall Street Journal: "They don't go on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar of the Ried municipality, which is installed in a "civil vehicle", to monitor the tempo limit is stationed on the garden road according to the municipality of Ried from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes installed.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The ease on Schalke is great after the first season win.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and lots of balls in our penalty room," said Schalke 04's sports manager - and breathed up.
After all, the royal blues had still managed to bring the close 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first season victory under the roof and subject.
In fact, this could have happened differently.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of chief coach Domenico Tedesco had given security Tedesco: "In total, the first half-time was good, both playful and pressing".
Don't actually make a headball monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore retreated further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who didn't have an essential part in it with his headball hit: "I'm actually the worst headball player in man creation."
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the initial phase and make a fireworks out of it forcefully," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to deal with games over 90 minutes.
The biggest lack of the afternoon: King's Blue missed it, rather to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a bitter victory," Tedesco said, "you've already felt the fear a little."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only schalker with that.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke wasn't to be overlooked.
From about two kilometres away, a hiker in Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday around 1.30 pm.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause soon came out of police and fire brigade: An unknown man had lit up on a surface of two square meters on Gschwendner Berg Tüll.
According to the police, it seemed as if he had been watching the fire for a long time, but then left the glut unsupervised.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachauer Firefighters were busy with the dissipation and extinguishing.
The police are now investigating the case for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at the height of the eye
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani, stands before them.
He followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild several times.
"I have been tasked with bringing interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Cultural Policy" in the orientation of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject intelligibly.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and some joke, he brings one of the most conflict-rich themes to the audience: migration and integration.
Why, despite successful integration, are conflicts growing?
The Syrian author uses himself to answer the question of a metaphor.
The German society sits at a table, the first-generation migrants at the cat's table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to vote.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether you order yourself politically to the right or left, but: "Am I in favour of or against an open society?" he stresses.
In the beginning, more behaviour, then more and more the discussion begins.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they saw successful or unsuccessful integration with students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not express his opinion, stresses that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session he had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also was intensively discussed in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities.
Basketball: Bonn and casting win kick-off games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn finished the first day of the Bundesliga Basketball (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen performed in a hard-hitting party in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.

On Friday, Munich tried to reach a 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg on Saturday with 84:80.
Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 properties
The need is obviously enormous: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the properties in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first properties in the new building area of Landsham-Süd on the free market.
This is what Mayor Roland Frick tells us.
In addition, the application phase has been completed for those 20 properties that the municipality offers at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
A good 100 applications were received, according to Frick.
"The documents are currently being reviewed", regarding the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Pliening, the aim was to have the candidates listed for the 20 properties by the end of the year and to present them to the municipal council.
The award may then be made.
In total, on the area south of Landsham, 50 plots are created for single and double houses, as well as four areas for multi-family houses with expected eight housing units each.
The development is now almost complete, and the roads and roads are to be paved in the near future.
One single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in the socially-bearable model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as an affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments supported by the Free State.
Place for 200 people
Grossly estimated is created on the area of the new construction area Landsham-South living space for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start for the new construction of a day care centre is taking place there.
Three groups of kindergartens and three cribs and one multipurpose room are to be housed in it.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, for the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalkes Naldo "big sport" succeeds on the bench as well
For the third time in a row, not in the start-album: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Domenico Tedesco at Schalke-Trainer.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not been to the Schalker Startelf for the third time in a row, but had sat on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people, had the nearly two-metre-sized Brazilian had spoken so correctly about the frustration of the soul.
But when, after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05, the Schalker players gathered as usual in the middle circle and thanked Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, all of whom call Naldo easy to say, broke in and said, "We have to thank coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction to his vice-captain, who, despite his re-reservist existence, didn't care about anything.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best schooner last season, knows that he did not actually get on the track with his coach - but gets a break for good reasons.
One reason called "tax control".
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco told me about the moment when he had said Nodo that he wasn't in the start-seat.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto for 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone can get a run-through at the moment.
And that we're all in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which finally also caught Naldo.
And to whom the Brazilians responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving to be an exemplary team player on the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to accelerate its valley trip in August compared to the euro zone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month depth.
Austria still has the third best mood across Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute announced on Monday its survey of under 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro zone's PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index is still the 13th month in a row under the brand of 50 meters, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry cracked this threshold by 50.9 points in August.
The Greeks were the final light (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but more slowly than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened valley trip could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry - in any case, in the third quarter - remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: the export orders in the euro area fell as much as since November 2011.
The companies therefore built up posts in the seventh consecutive month.
Even in China, industrial production fell more than initially assumed in August.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the month before to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, storage and prices are raised.
Tuchels PSG team succeeds behind victory in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice Trainer Thomas Tuchel with Paris Saint-Germain in France’s Football Championship continues from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice, the defending champion won two Superstar Neymar matches at 3:0 (1:0) and was thus also successful in the eighth league match.
The last time at Olympique Lyon in France 82 years ago, it was such a good start to the season.
The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and finished in the playtime.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) was responsible for the interim 2:0.
Paris also passed the general test for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the royal class, Tuchel's team had to face the only compulsory game defeat this season at 2:3 in Liverpool.
