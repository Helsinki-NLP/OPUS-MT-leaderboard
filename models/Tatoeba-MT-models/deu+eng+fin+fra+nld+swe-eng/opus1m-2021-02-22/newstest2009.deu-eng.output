The Prague Stock Exchange falls into the minus against the closing of the business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange immediately started trading on Monday when it fell by a further six percentage points.
This time it was the reason for the break-in on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there, has been demonstrated.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case occurred on Tuesday on the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock exchange index lost nearly four percentage points over the business day, but later it was able to offset some of the losses, reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then lost to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock exchange fell by 3.6 percent according to the index there.
"The timing of the rescue action in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," said the Head of Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Although it belongs to China, Hong Kong determines its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese Central Bank.
Hong Kong interest rates are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft financial support.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the invasion.
A bloodbath of American shares
The American House of Representatives rejected on Monday the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's request to support the plan.
Bush believes that the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the largest break-in in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, and a similar break-in he had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any sign that the draft would not pass through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concessions: US government is allowed to pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial aid for the American financial system.
That is to be agreed at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators reached a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial aid for the American financial system totalling $700 billion (about 12 trillion).
However, this does not mean a victory.
Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated at the American Congress on Monday.
On Sunday this was said by Barney Frank, Chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee of the Reuters Agency.
According to various reports in the Senate, it is likely that the plan could be voted on at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first major psychological factor for stimulating financial markets.
However, this is followed by a "disillusionment" due to the complex mechanisms, which could also help markets in practice.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
"We have achieved significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilise the market should look like," said Democratic Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to her words, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Legislators met with the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson the night of Sunday to give his final form to the government fund.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets from financial companies, which cause the financial companies to fall into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue with the healing plan, but I think we're on target," Paulson says.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets which are falling sharply.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
This is to reassure investors of transactions in the Asian financial markets, which lie in the first time zone, where a Congress decision could affect the business on Monday.
But until now it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty as to whether the negotiations could not fail at the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will still be subject to some changes.
The total amount earmarked for assistance to the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
However, the Congress can block the disbursement of the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, for another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush values positive progress in negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can vote in favour of his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea behind the programme has remained, based on the fact that hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages for buying bad mortgage securities.
"We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday," says Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "estimate the efforts of both sides to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden umbrellas
The chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senator Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, stated that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of discounts and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called golden umbrellas for directors of companies involved in the programme and set up a committee to monitor the fund.
The Ministry of Finance shall be responsible for this task.
"We have worked very hard on this and achieved great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also expects to help homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly cost to debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because you don't know what mechanism and what price the problematic assets are bought up through.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government split the losses among themselves," said Marek this week to the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or at the beginning of next week, Marek believes that it is not decisive.
"It is much more important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on adoption is at this moment the most important," Marek stressed.
Duell on Messers cutting: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still call.
Therefore, of course, it seems that it is better to buy only one phone.
In spite of everything, there are enough reasons why you should be a stand-alone player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
Sure you'll find it hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album on it.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and there is no objective reason from a qualitative point of view.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, you probably dream at least of one of them.
This is also simplified with the music on travel, i.e. with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
Also here there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a Pink-Floyd fan will probably be hard to get the headphones for twenty crowns out of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do doesn't even make sense.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions of telephone and simsing, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the more often you will have to reload it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, mostly it's much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are much more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect cheap mobile phones to be able to play music for no longer than a few hours.
If you make calls every now and then, you'd rather buy a charger for the office for security – which also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players you won't have this problem, even the less good keep out at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one charge.
Another problem is if you want to play the music on your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB lock, as well as not every mobile phone without special software can be connected directly to a PC.
Of course, you can play the music directly on a storage medium, but only a few card readers are done without reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players, you do not need any special software until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players set up a music library themselves, arranged according to the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iliver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones can be more
When selecting a specific device, you should check for battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and, of course, ease of use.
If for you music is mostly a backdrop and you hear it every day just for example in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which can really be almost any phone.
You don't have to check which music formats can process a mobile phone or a player.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be in this format.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the relevant pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already be a decisive argument for why a music phone should be installed.
Unfortunately, the providers offer is poor and mostly limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that the music industry will be dominated in the future by this type of sale of music (whether via GSM, the Internet or the wireless Internet).
Most of the cell phones are on it.
If you want to hear something, grab the phone in the jacket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it matters whether you are wearing headphones or at least a wireless handset.
If not, you can access the integrated speaker, which almost every phone has, but only the least MP3 player.
The biggest advantage of the music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually costs less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most people that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically matured phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
In turn, the advantage of the player lies in the easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) - player can really use anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity when operating with the former normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
It does not threaten a collision in the form of an erroneously hired mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous invoice for data transmissions.
Which device should you now grab?
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are sufficient.
But be careful.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy another low-cost MP3 player, you can access Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Irish.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Belong to the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the ease of operation thus comes to the one of a single MP3 player.
The widest is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide MP3 players from the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer virtually all the services offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe this one won't be waiting any longer.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that Czech mobile operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority ČTū, which drew attention to the fact that the price of a text message here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps taken by the European Commission in regulating roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a fight.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators are pleased to say that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTū) Pavel Dvo the Czech telecommunications authority, who in the past had often said that there was no room for another supplier in the Czech Republic.
It is true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of opportunities (otherwise, it would probably not even find frequencies).
But there is one more possibility - a virtual provider.
In particular, the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market brought with it a significant reduction in prices, which then also had to be addressed by traditional mobile operators.
Before the entry into the UK market, such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile still had similar votes as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has proved that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't need to look for examples for long.
In February this we reported on the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus to become the country's fifth largest provider.
At the back of Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon among others in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a traditional provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, but this is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to put on a non-cliche target group.
This provider is specifically directed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is hard to say whether a similar concept could be applied in the Czech Republic as in Poland.
The press speaker at Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubted this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services."
In the Czech Republic, the mobile operators believe that
But it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look particularly hopeful.
There will be a market entry of Mobilking in other countries in our region," says Jana Studničková, President of the Penta Financial Group, in a telephone call.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to do so.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
For a long time, their interest in starting a virtual mobile service provider has been showing the GTS Novera Group, which wants to take a further step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only landline, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we were already able to make progress in the negotiation process," said Pavel Kaidl, the press speaker.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Non-official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a fully-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has great specificities vis-à-vis other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Srše the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specificities of the Czech market.
T-Mobile Martina Kemrová’s press speaker rarely adds to the O2 statement: “Until now, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which to build further.”
And she adds, "T-Mobile's network will hardly be a virtual provider by the end of the year.
At this moment, we already need a concrete offer to be able to think in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure sharing.
This is precisely what we regard as the best from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area lies in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The mobile operators' approach is easy to understand, another provider was called more competition, which would lead to a fall in prices and therefore also a decrease in profits.
Why, then, should such a competitor be made easier to enter the market?
The fact that the suppliers can pull a strand when it comes to something also proves the long way around the emergence of U:fon.
The strongest pressure towards ČTū was at the time when U:fon came on the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This also demonstrates the publicly available information from the ČTő websites.
Now U:fon is the reason why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile service provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and above all on its services."
However, in view of the approach taken by mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of ČTū, which unfortunately, unlike Britain and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czechs.
It has only the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem its very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible after a contract between a mobile service provider and a virtual service provider has been concluded through the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not of sufficient interest to the classic providers," said Kristián Chapupo in his answer to our request from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
Such a wording would not be surprising by the representatives of the providers.
This is more than worrying from an authority that represents consumer interests and, among other things, is supposed to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chapaus adds: "Where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a lowering of prices in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not part of the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, the almost already touching harmony of the three mobile operators is really shocking, resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just like the absolutely same petrol price at the petrol stations is certainly only a coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
"In this case, the Authority has found no evidence to suggest that there is anti-competitive action, and thus it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the suppliers has a dominant position on the market, so it does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for its actions on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile market to virtual providers are likely to be lacking from the telecoms regulatory authority," said Chapau in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTū, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always necessary for a virtual provider to enter the market.
And the mobile service provider - logically - has the monopoly for its network.
This means that he necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if this argument is not taken into account, it should at least be a warning to the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting similarly.
In doing so, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the company GTS Novera mentioned above) demonstrate that they face very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The reversal of responsibility for the ČTū is then a rather common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent amendment of the Telecommunications Act has failed to bring about the expansion of ČTī's competences in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay if nobody looks at you.
First of all, the operation of some pseudovirtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
It is companies which issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
Normally, these are companies that operate in the multi-level marketing sector.
Own mobile telephone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The joke is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company customer, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar types of resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it can be an infringement of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal, which can lead to the termination of cooperation with the relevant company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that this will not be the case with the mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three mentioned companies it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
In fact, the activities of these companies do not lead them to neglected profits, but at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite all that the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of the customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card on their phone does not run on its name, so they cannot fully possess it as the normal customers of mobile providers."
Even this alone, however, would have to happen at least strangely.
A further question also opens up for the ÚOHS.
Before such a procedure, mobile operators are blinding themselves to why they are blocking themselves against a virtual provider.
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to identify such activities, and if it does not, it does not have to satisfy itself with the statement of suppliers, they did not know anything about it and their business conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As the text has pointed out several times, the entry of virtual providers brought about a marked fall in prices for the various services.
Practically in all countries where virtual providers were created, traditional providers have tried to prevent their emergence more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies, which by no means sought to safeguard the interests of mobile operators, but of their customers, intervened at these very times.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are turning to the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get the impression that uncertainty in our competences is more than favorable in these cases.
But let us not throw the flute into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon appears, the Czech mobile market may soon be moving again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National Anthem Where is my home country on the occasion of the day of Czech statehood in an hour of celebration.
The hymn was replayed by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji the Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
Kateřina Kn theková and Adam Plachetka took over the singing session.
The workmen of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremi, and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he had told the Czech radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo variants, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried with both and then with the choir to follow a clear diction so that the text could be understood well, so that a harmony could be created," said the conductor.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj first sounded in 1834 on the stage of the standing theatre in the Czech piece Fidlovacka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škrup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song became an organic component of the national anthem after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven symbols of the state remained even after the independent Czech Republic was formed.
How does the "new" hymn sound
The Prague transport companies also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague's transport companies as a date when the first passengers enter a subway, tram or bus, which carries an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it played on their chip card at the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the U-Bahn stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádra the Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Let fory, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have also been available on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until afternoon hours.
Those who use internet sales can really forget the output window at subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long queues for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via internet, it is played on the open card in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points, travellers can also have a switch with trained staff that advises interested parties about buying the Internet and also plays the coupon on the map," said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on the open card at self-service machines, which are installed in some subway buses.
What do such automatic machines look like?
They are red, reminding of ticket drivers, the passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be eighty until the end of the year," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls an automaton instead of the driver
Operating the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
All you have to do is introduce the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon plays on its own.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburbs and on the bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants mainly come from the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia to the capital.
"In the trains that belong to the Prague integrated transport system, the train-accompanied readers have to check the validity of the coupons according to time and zone," says Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid. "This organisation compiles the timetables for the Prague transport operations.
The city buses have card readers at the check-in desk with the driver.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown by the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked position at the side of the cash desk.
Thus the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver to provide this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not ride by city buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon will end, in turn, can go to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten called for a referendum by the US
The Sudeten Germans had asked for the integration of the Bohemian Forest into the United States in 1945.
This is apparent from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans are supposed to have turned to the US President in 1945.
This can be seen, among other things, in a letter which has been kept in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American President not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want to be sure that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it says in a letter signed with the words "people who are at the heart of the fate of the Sudeten".
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia suggests that the Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national character - would expect brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are speaking to a state that is foreign to us, who is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has made absolutely no contribution to the victory of the Allies," is to be read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is alleged to be fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States has doubts about the mindset of the Bohemian Forests, it is sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in Bohemian Forestgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or would live under the rule of protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, in the opinion of some witnesses, it draws a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans at least had to know that they would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them had such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Again, others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chapau, who comes from Budweis.
He was appointed to the Navy at the Baltic Sea as a Budweiser German during the war.
When he arrived in British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a war prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought if they came home the Czech would come to pass," said Chapau.
In his opinion, none of the German prisoners of war who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia expected that he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotion-laden campaign is aimed at motorists
Most expensive action on road safety in Czech history.
This is also the way to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday.
The Aleš  the Minister's authority promises to take drivers away from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, on radio, in cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to take the driver off too fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to hang on before the start of the ride.
The campaign mainly wants to talk to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people appealing to emotions.
This is also reflected in the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "don't think" appear in capital letters on a sign.
And in a laughter of blood, the word "pay".
This means that you can pay for a moment of carelessness with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the audience until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is possible to see normal images with drastic shots of accident victims.
It is promising that the number of accidents and the number of road deaths will fall on Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whip for the motorists
"The motto of sugar bread and whips applies to the riders.
Sugar bread means that when driving at red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce Martin Ko the hospital.
And that's why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
Even less effective are, in his opinion, boards that draw the attention of drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static board that warns you of a danger, it will probably soon flow into the environment, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," Koñn says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The Chairman of the Provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, has declared himself in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace with Palestine and Syria could be concluded in exchange for this.
He emphasized this in an interview, which was printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all the (occupied) territories, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He admitted that any return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, doesn't want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends has done, will have to give up some of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out in an appeal to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple bear and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert expressed his support for the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he considered to be an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," said Olmert.
"The Syrians only know too well what they must refrain from in order to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Schiitian) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Schiitian) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards illegal in the bus?
The law doesn't know them, in a long distance bus the walk is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus from the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, there is a question as to whether Stewards and travelers are allowed to ride on the bus during the trip.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a Steward is contrary to the law on road transport," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old Stewardess last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
The young woman sat at this moment to all the accident next to the driver, on the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident at the moment or brake sharply, in which the Steward carries out coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role in whether the bus is also equipped with standing spaces to the letter of the vehicle.
If this is not provided for in the bus, travellers must sit.
Student Agency's long distance buses do not have any standing spaces; as confirmed by Radim Jančura, director of the company against Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not first agree to the movement of travellers.
Later this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that travellers may go to the toilet during the trip if they have their seat," he said.
The law doesn't know Steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a Steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the term "car companion", but its rights and obligations are not defined", the spokesman of the Ministry of Hanselka clearly adds.
On the other hand, the director of the road vehicles department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law covers this problem retroactively.
"It matters whether the bus also has standing spaces in the product registration.
That's all," he stresses.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and a higher permissible speed and long distance bus without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the skilled man says
The BESIP traffic safety specialist Jaroslav Ho then sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid driving mode, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Even here, it is not certain when turbulences come, and the Stewardess can hit its head."
"But if a bus stops sharp, then the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in a city bus or a tram.
Stewards' safety needs to be clarified by internal regulations," he says, and he also believes that this issue is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency offers Stewards services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
Even after the accident, the director does not regard her profession as risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the Stewart's profession is risky, I'm going to delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by travellers upon arrival.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin explains the lack of Stewards in his bus. His company, however, operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have Stewardes, but we've been fighting since the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he said not quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy.
During the accident of a bus to Naples, a young Stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for society for two years, was unhappy.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent from the stand strip without blinking and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid a sharp manoeuvre, but collided with the right front with the truck.
The fact that the two seats had been sold for the Stewards denied Jančura.
"These places cannot be reserved for long distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court judgment, but it also expects financial compensation from the debtor.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the Stewards movement on board a bus could bring a legal regulation on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
"This, however, has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones on the road," says Prof.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the Stewards to be anything that could significantly jeopardise the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, with the control of bus safety in the competence of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorfer Hopes Rest on Frankfurt
In large terms, the WestLB Board's letter to the staff of the house is not missing.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf Monetary Institute with the Frankfurt Deca-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Financegruppe" was created, according to the letter that became known on Monday.
The WestLB integrates a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further groupings in the state banking sector.
This is the way a board wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
The attack on WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia recently made clear that it is time to find a future solution.
However, the WestLB has for some time been talking about a connection between the deca bank, which is familiar with savings bank customers because of their investment funds.
Although Deka Bank Chief Franz Waas told us at the end of August when he presented the half-year figures, he saw no sense in a merger of the house on Mainz Landstraße with a state bank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the decade, which is supported half by the Landesbanken and the savings banks' associations, has instructed the Board to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have, of course, just begun, as they say at the financial centre.
The decade-bank, which together with its 3000 employees is one of the most important employers at the Frankfurt Financial Square, is not the first time the issue has been addressed when it comes to consolidation in the savings banks sector.
In 2003, it looked like the decade-bank could merge with the state bank Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
However, nothing came from this tricycle.
The plans had hardly been made public, and the Hessian government opposed Helaba’s participation.
Even the other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart instead.
But there has always been thought games about a connection of the decade-bank with state banks.
Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, had, however, recently spoken out against plans games about a merger with his house.
However, regardless of this, it seems to mature the realization that a merger of the various houses of the public law sector is needed.
After the Landtag election in Bavaria is over, the first thing to do is to connect BayernLB to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
Should the pressure rise to further mergers, the partners are gradually moving forward.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has experienced the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Sparkassen-Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which is involved with 85 percent in Helaba, has, in turn, postponed a line at the beginning of the year to a meeting with the West LB.
At least the north LB remained.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is a question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the key question with which the business model was to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken had not been answered by the German Sparkasse and Giroverband.
In the end, the West LB could also be disbanded, but there is no self-proclaimed.
In the letter from the local board of directors, for example, it is also mentioned that a "total solution" would be sought for the house in any case.
How this can be done by bringing together individual units with the deca bank under a hat will still be shown.
The second meadow weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so be everything different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bartender and proves to the about 200 October Festival travellers what deep tones can produce its throats.
Elena's gonna give Luca a blow, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus park next to Puorta Nuova train station, starting at 11.45 this evening four buses, "destinazione Monaco, Festa della birra", arrive expected at 6.30 pm.
Three buses are reserved for Italians, only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans already sing beside their flag, they have celebrated already at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelzimite lining and glasses with wide silver irons, is included in the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours it is alone this year.
At night, during the day on the meadow, back at 10:30.
Sleep would only mean unnecessary specs, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, wedding faithful to the Bavarian purity bid, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - inclusive.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada towards "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet in the bus, the travellers sleep.
All right, they'll still need their strength.
Stellen is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where also a number of other buses with Italian signs on the motorway 8 shortly before Munich introduce a rest.
When Marcos Group finally arrives in the early parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven on schedule, there are already the 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco makes one last speech, explains the attack plan.
First, set the yellow cap.
On the left is "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, in addition to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors go up to the beer tent, it's running!" Marco calls in the morning.
Run and occupy the seats in the rear part of the tent.
"Not in the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, distribute in space!"
The measure, bursts Marco, cost 8,25 euros.
And don't forget the tip.
"The security people show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they're gone."
Third: "Tonight, find point half past eleven again here!"
And it's going to the meadow.
On the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs, and even to the poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be armed for the retreat.
It is the second meadow weekend, known as "Italian weekend".
There is no precise data on numbers; the talk is about 50,000 who are on their way across the Alps and entering the beer tents, and ten percent of all visitors are expected to have come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which carries out a national statistics in which the Italians take first place in front of the British (about 60 posts) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical supplies.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system was relatively stable, as Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück pointed out only last week.
How good it was that the politician used the word "relative" and that the German banking sector was not spared from the crisis-like developments.
Because it has now entered the weekend.
The Munich real estate funder Hypo Real Estate (HRE) listed in the Dax receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate had to interest only the part it also uses.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background are losses at the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he has granted money, the State financier had very short-term funding - which is no longer possible because of the distrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had been reduced by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million compared to the previous year's period.
Only because of higher revenues from repayments of subsequent settlement costs arising from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the order of taxation and from the provision of business for group companies, the loss of income had still been moderated by around 16 per cent.
The former state financier had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans after its privatisation in 1990, which had then been distributed to Aareal Bank.
Because of the limited value of traditional state funding, the Depfa had then more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects by private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make amortizations that will have a "essential material effect" on the Group's profit and loss account, it is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend has been removed.
It had already been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure funder since the Depfa acquisition.
It is more dependent than other institutions on the refinancing of the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending to the banks is again largely reduced, as the banks are horrifying their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a part of the loan portfolio of the Depfa’s short-term loan (around EUR 50 billion) to be refinanced every year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are met with the credit in a timely manner and the Company "undercuts the influence of the currently largely inoperative international money markets".
From other sources, it can be said that funding will be secured by the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke stated, on the other hand, that Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstswährung (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now ensured.
This is to be hoped for by shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unthinkable that the financing does not have to be fully used.
But the opposite is not tossed out either.
After the late Sunday evening of hearing the bank was still in the process of insolvency, at least preliminary salvation could not calm the mind.
The share price breaks by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond rates are quite good.
In the absence of any movement in the primary debt, the rates of the subordinated bond are more clearly reflected.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are concerned and, understandably, the durations beyond 2009.
If hypo-real-estate bonds, in the past, seem to be a speculative investment alternative, then their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the marked tightening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the takeover of the Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less busy commercial banks are ready to support the system, it can be assumed that the pensions will be abolished on a regular basis.
Or it happens, which hardly anyone yet dares to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports that overlap with the sub-stateisation, the probability of security has now become only a legitimate hope.
This should, above all, prepare long-term believers for some sleepless nights with the decision to separate them from their commitments.
Short-term investors can use a final line to make a loss proposition for future tax payments on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is scheduled to appear at Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start to tickle: The Germans are totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells of Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before I went to school, I had Baummel.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way by myself. Fortunately, I didn't go.
The beginning of the class at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students trip in from eight o'clock until at twenty-nine a short round begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the class started, I was in a row to introduce myself.
I'm not even the guy who likes to talk to people, nor a class of 40 students.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my guest mother, with blouses, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So, in this elevator, I've been standing in front of the desk and trying to put it all right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, come from Germany and have a week's birthday.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all taunted, kooked and wept and I have heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival-important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'needful, sweet'.
Then I quickly stepped into my place.
The girl next to me has grinded pretty wide, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really upset.
Everyone talked and tickled and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all of them packed their Bentos.
My host mother had also made me such a lunch box - that's something different than the fateful German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofu coat.
Most of the time I don't have a pale face, which is exactly what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It says everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, perhaps, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a self-made Bento to a boy, which then makes her especially artistically executed - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the break snack.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I'm excited if I can watch this too.
'Why not Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me."
Finally, I have been reading mangas for years.
And to better understand the comics and culture in them, I started learning a little Japanese at some point.
So for me it was perfectly clear that I had to go here sometime.
Because I also have a low for tradition, customs and customs.
And on that you put great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not yet felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a scavenger flees in danger means that they also feel fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same when they behave like we do?
In the Internet magazine Edge, contributions from famous scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and cut off questions of feeling or generally consciousness, we enter intrusive terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it gets dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, which is why some scientists conclude on a comparable subjective experience.
I do not believe that, however.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with the human consciousness include the side prefrontal Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much higher developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal Cortex, including the knowledge that we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic is the linguistic nature of man: as such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be created, probably differed greatly from most of our consciousness states.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither measure nor, because of the special hardware, analyze on our own experience, then his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interpretations refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be easier to access scientifically.
One could examine the animal consciousness processes without regard to their contents, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualisation.
But in this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, one focuses more on the neural correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also stresses the importance of the prefrontal Cortex for the state of visualisation.
What is the result of the sensations?
I remind them that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its own activities conscious brain.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the Cortex regions, which distinguish primates and, in particular, humans.
Connected with linguistic nature results in fine degrees of sensation, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, says that sensations from primitive activities in the body sensation regions of the Cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network had not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could certainly be involved in cross-genital sensations.
In theory, I cannot contradict it, but consider it unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be a fear among rats and humans is likely to feel this way in both cases: but how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A shadow flees in danger if she also feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove an equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain strains, shading not even a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this to man, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from those of ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior to the emotional sensations of rats.
At any rate, progress at the neural level can be made here, provided that the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, or sensations, I do not know whether they exist.
You might think this is short-sighted, but I'd rather go ahead than run against a wall all the time.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work just started and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
The number of EM sites may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at maximum speed," said the Ukrainian Association President Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki said of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer."

Empress Dennis Quaid Rejects
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outtook her lost Dennis Quaid as a adulterer.
It foams - and beats back.
Late Rose War at the ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant dispute with each other - in general.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan had for the first time expressed himself as a reason for the marriage's failure: "Dennis was disloyal to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
It was only after the divorce that she learned the extent of the fraud.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of a adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's response to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's horrible," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News" that "Meg re-skinned and sealed the story of our relationship for a repeated time."
It was also "deplorable" that the common 16-year-old son Jack was again publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that meant divorce for every child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became Father of Gemini.
And so his engagements close with the side-heavy: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy to appreciate that I have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Lower prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany were even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and nights spent in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant break in the second quarter following an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for many years, nights have already fallen in many places.
From January to March, prices rose by an average of 6.9% in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The trend had been most marked in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year earlier.
For this reason, American Express sees the weak dollar rate that had led to a "decreasing desire for travel by American tourists".
Also, financial sites such as Frankfurt or London are more affected by the fall in hotel prices as industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
In the first quarter, the trend also showed up:
Due to kerosene costing, travellers in the Economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, the average price of Economic Class flights fell by 12.5 per cent from the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more rapidly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 per cent.
According to the study, prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
On the one hand, the reason for the fall in prices is the decline in economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market is staggering.
On the other hand, the Open-Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, has increased competition pressure.
The situation was marked by the cancellation of unprofitable routes for airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had registered bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods the Hamburger SV becomes the table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to find a working elve.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge breakout for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play only late and failed with a lever to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went to him convincingly about the lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin passage of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not loose in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most sat back in their places.
Rieger was almost three decades of physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a higher reputation than some lost actor.
And so his request also found his hearing in the responsible place.
The assistant trainer Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted the thumbs in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, head coach of Hamburg.
Its command will have been similar: Come with gate two!
Implementation was not achieved.
"It wasn't nice to see everything today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it "more relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers owe the headball hit of Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summarized.
The Hamburg SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and the flash table on the video wall, which designated their club as class primeus.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to organize this," said Marcell Jansen.
He knows that the tabular intermediate is more for the incalculability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team, with its late-on-the-job accesses - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalie Petric and the Jansen who had been dismissed by FC Bavaria - finds themselves slow, yet unable to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbles," asked Jol.
After the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
First news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily caused the Dow Jones to break by 700 points.
That was the biggest score loss within a day of his history.
Later the dow caught up again.
At around 8:30 p.m. the world's most important stock market barometer, with about five percent in the minus, recorded 10.579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at 1548 points, with more than seven percent in the minus.
The largest loser was at that time in the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about twelve percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs amounted to almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Grand Investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the company.
Under the rescue plan, the funds will be made available for the purchase of so-called low mortgages.
However, the sum is not to be paid in one stroke, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock option notes from financial companies that could be redeemed in the event of price changes in order to reduce the burden on the State Treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and USA in the downwards
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the US do not resolve investors' doubts.
The stock price of the German big bank Hypo Real Estate falls and pulls the Dax downwards.
The U.S. Dow Jones index loses the state despite the planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have deeply reduced the German Stock Index (Dax).
Despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate bank temporarily lost three quarters of its value, with Commerzbank giving up more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important 6000-point mark and noted with a decrease of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The stock markets went to the knees worldwide.
Wall Street opened in New York City with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's $700 billion rescue package could not be sufficient to bring the financial markets back on track.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809,25 points in the first trading hour.
The U.S. House wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also had only one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially decreased by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743,61.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.

Dark Matter Affects Flight of Space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused uncertainty: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by manoeuvres.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity could not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the "Ulysses" spacecraft flew through space.
Because of soon-frozen fuel lines, you are now threatened with cold death.
Among scientists, for years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion - the swing-by-anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been surprised by this for years: the missiles do not behave 100% as would be expected according to the old-fashioned gravity law.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They called him swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have figured out in the universe.
"Responsible to the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously a force of attraction whose effect can be observed on other heavenly bodies.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, dark matter accounts for a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists carried to Egypt are to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had claimed several million euros of ransom.
Six hostages were killed in a shooting before release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Redemption negotiations are already under way.
Always Germans get into the visor of kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists towed into the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV station Al-Arabija and the Italian media in agreement.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by the Italian TV station Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We're just checking their health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, were up and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are scheduled to be on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers had been prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers surprisingly.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom payment," the official said.
It was "just about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, the Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers and arrested two of them.
The hostages had asked for a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, calling on a German mediator, the release of hostages delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men should be detained until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather led to a woman killing herself, was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to a prison sentence of six years after he had committed eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court found that he regularly tied his stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for their death."
The court found that Ms. Randle killed herself in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and connected her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Ms. Randle, who volunteered to work for the National Trust for a large part of her time, was persecuted for abuse that had been added to her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "forgoes her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by suffocating herself by means of a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a confession letter, which ended: "I used to tie her and connect her eyes."
"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been frightening, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I am aware of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Indicted officials responsible for lost data
The BBC has learned that the Cabinet Officer, who had strictly lost confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged in accordance with the "Public Security Act".
The man was seconded to the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally at the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee, whose name cannot be named, is accused, in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, of the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor recommended that the officer be accused by the Metropolitan Police of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he posted contained classified reviews of Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies face B&B costs
British housing companies could cost more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits of 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's loans have been cleared.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is calculated each year by the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously ... will now be called upon to cover some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay around 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will be GBP 450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies have to raise 81 million pounds for the first year's interest rates.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed the BBC that he believed that this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that behave cautiously during the upswing of real estate will now be called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and this could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are bipartite organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk gets five Pence per litre more expensive
The people in Jersey are confronted with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by another five Pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two Pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the main market price for Jersey milk changed most recently in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail claim by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Their defenders said that the court refused bail regarding the charge of 50 million taka ($729,700) being blackmailed by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against her.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released against bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-supported transitional government first grant her full freedom.
Correspondents say that, although her detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear, as part of her release, whether she will be able to remain on the open when she returns to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers state that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court dismissed Sheikh Hasina's bailback because it says she doesn't have to receive a bail because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the Supreme Court."
Their lawyers claim that they need a security deposit to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17th, said an Awami Alliance Party Chairman on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-supported transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Concerns about the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
The recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan has not vaccinated nearly 200,000 children due to violence linked to the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination programme last week in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder thousands of vaccination workers.
BskyB loses claim in case ITV
BskyB has lost its claim against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its share of the competing ITV station.
The Competition Court ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that BskyBs’ share distorts competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on the ITV channel.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL from buying ITV, now renamed Virgin Media.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB made doubts as to the independence of ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office ofcom have opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, in particular because BskyB had announced that it would give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. public prosecutor's affairs
The U.S. Attorney General has instructed a special investigator to deal with the termination of the nine prosecutors in the U.S. in 2006.
The reason for this was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report criticised the White House officials, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
The specialist investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to hinder the judicial process.
Serious allegations, including criminal proceedings, have not been fully investigated or clarified, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to force the Witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when in December 2006 the Ministry of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed because of low labour costs.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had been judged no worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to consider the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate the accusations of electoral fraud by the Democrats.
U.S. state attorneys are charged with investigating and persecuting judicial cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be suspended for political reasons.
At that time the head of the Ministry of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was arrested because of the dismissals and finally established his office.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the Inspector General's report made a critical reference to the role of Gonzales by carrying the "main responsibility" for the redundancies, by "despite" his leadership role and by "unusually disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including the former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, were criticised for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize next week in London during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which takes nine minutes and fifty seconds, was titled Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
"Coldplay" points out the nominations for the award this year after it has come into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there would be some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released for sale in 1979 as single in the UK and reached the 15th place in the charts.
However, Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an operation in 2003 for irregular heart beats after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to an acute inflammation of the throat.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal tape.
Obscurity road in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side roads and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
Nevertheless, even experienced taxi drivers and long-term residents find it difficult to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks rather like a dusty alley than an actively used highway.
There are no street signs either.
It is virtually impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to repatriate Extra Place to create a clean passage to the stores and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
However, the City Administration Department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Municipal Council Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the municipal administration and Avalon Bay designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district head of the municipal council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers to repair and operate the road that Avalon could do, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small road will be repatriated and that seats will be set up, among other things, for a café the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman at Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the road, it didn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decaying alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Building Protection Department, said that it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop the properties rather than manage them.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between its numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly best known as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The plaster was great," said Danny Fields, the director of Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splitter of the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A bitter Nostalgic View of the Extinct City"), has published part of the discussion of the city history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that remains dark even during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and weekly newspapers flying past rain showers".
With few exceptions the road has looked exactly like this recently in one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti were to be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the ground not far from a fresh bundle of out-of-range newspapers.
Some passersby said that they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be somewhat polished up.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, humid and disgusting.
The debate on bilingual education: Education in the English-speaking environment
In this issue of "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Research Fellow in California Studies and Senior Director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not As Good as One Thinks: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Selection".
Addressing the Hispanian voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the likelihood of successful school completion among African-American and Hispanian students is lower than among white students" - which is true.
In order to close this gap in performance, Obama's education plan recommends, among other things, a bilingual transition phase in education for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance from school to school.
Take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Spanish and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008 amazing 100 percent of students in the fourth grade passed the state exam in Mathe at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school were rated as well in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved by other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, continuous control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practises the approach after which training takes place in an English-speaking environment. That is exactly the point Obama is supposed to pay attention to, says school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach places great emphasis on the almost exclusive use of English in specialist education.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later you could enter the classroom and not recognize him again.
"It works," she remarked, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
School performance would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the National Image Associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While he agreed that immigrants should learn English, he had recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about "English only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work instead of despise them and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The oil price fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
In the morning session, crude oil trading on the New York trading market fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulences on Wall Street and strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak in July of $145.29 per barrel, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, and then, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets, rose again.
On Monday, even though Congressional representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan that should be the biggest in history, investors have expressed concern.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, the Citigroup is supposed to buy up the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place during the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not managed to revive the atmosphere in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote to investors in a communication that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. American virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The bank's analysts have lowered their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 have decreased by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Internal defenseman Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything after he'd been up in the jets in the last eight and a half years more often than anyone else.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned a resultsless game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like this before," Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their developing collaboration took a huge step forward.
In this quarter, Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, one being a defenseman and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't get very excited," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catch, the defense quarterback took Kurt Warner apart.
Outside defenseman Darrelle Revis took off an unfortunate throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and took him off.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had won the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets back conquered the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot into a 34 to 0 lead.
That was most of the points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the jets left 21 points in the third quarter without reaching one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were reached in a short time."
Ruined bristle sauce beats its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some think he is the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first human being to make the 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59 Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he achieved at least a world championship title or set a world record on each route from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie left the Beijing Olympic marathon out of fear, which was perhaps exaggerated in the aftermath, that air pollution could worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched to long-distance routes, the record time for marathons in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won the result 2:06:05 in 1998 in Berlin.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie informed the press that he had had cramps in his Wade two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Obviously he came back after break and not rusted.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I took the training again a week ago and had some concerns today, but at the end everything was great."
He was criticised for his excessive orchestration of his races - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - and for avoiding many world's best marathon stars in general, for relying too much on the race leaders as if that were a race, and for setting world records over the race.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of Brusselassies as long-distance runners.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the line in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had dropped.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his final appearance to separate himself from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
With women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as a back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She planned her way by leaving a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners first, but overtaken after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardships in the lives of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the growths of the amusement parks in Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic drift, lies a quiet city where pride and the complications of African-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first completely black town in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three crucibles, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that describes it – and made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida Travel Guide, which was produced during the depression of the Federal Writer Project – is in many respects a very special place.
Eatonville is so independent, strong and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "slowly knows about us that he doesn't know what's missing from him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open discussion on racial relations, many people here are still sorry to be watched by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a member of the congregation of the oldest church in the city.
It must be."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the black culture of the rural south, sometimes condemned, sometimes praised, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on their guard.
And so rightly the concerns about Eatonville's image began with Zora, as all Hurston here call it.
She presented her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Travel Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten centre of Florida to the locations of black history and human drama.
Frightened like Oskar in real life as well as in literature, Hurston reader led to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Apart from the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Witwe Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and always fits into hourly rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things the way they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls immortalized the Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
One still remembers Hurtson here as a lively eccentric who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston got burned into the city, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed with pants, in a city that today has something to do with her venerable clothing style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many were despised.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he swinged in his chair, on a rear-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, in which Hurston was baptized in all probability.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were broken.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it.
Although once a famous writer, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great memorial celebration, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution to the world or their heritage in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a 2003 biography about Hurston.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-track highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the city's slow two-track main road.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the motorway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the congregation.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial confusion brought hatred into the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys often came and threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting away," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's claim to force integration by calling its decision in the Brown case against the school council "respecting my race rather than my race".
Citizens today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group composition in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged his teacher in the morning and they hugged his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri , daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap," Ms. Nathiri said.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors, and artists, who are far removed from prejudices, as it did, with positive self-confidence and statements like: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made his way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a highly praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelves, and again made her part of the American literary canon.
The long-distance project came at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight of the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening ceremony two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
Some years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-track long-distance road revived the city, accelerated things at peak speed, aroused real citizen pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd put it a bit easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There have been more and more journeys, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to the church since 1993 and locals began to re-estimate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (of course named after Hurston) opened on the newly paved Kennedy Boulevard in 2006.
Today Eatonville is still a speciality in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlando's city centre, sometimes it can feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She is 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, prior authorization is necessary and certain things - such as the mural of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and representing black men in the field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous, confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew larger, an increased degree of homelessness was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw its entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better, and just as proud, creative and eager, silly and mixed up as any other group of races and peoples in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's Neffen, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is about to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or at the police, who, according to him, could use some help.
And even the disciples, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only go through here will think, "Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon last Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here we in New York are talking about a fluid financial latrine.
At first sight nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they're in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst horror working day every day since the collapse of the stock market in 1929.
Suppliers still push with loud flaps the metal tea tables along the sidewalks and carry tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still snort between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with around the 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office staff are still waiting for their breakfast bagel on their own stand on the citizens' slopes and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon I decided to open a new savings account due to all the collapse of the world.
Although I had decided to put my duty time on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were standing snakes.
Not to the cash desks to collect or deposit money, but to the customer service switch where regular customers order check books, ask tourists for the way to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them in front of me, so later I learned from Starr, my "personal banker licensed," for the same reason I was a snake.
unlike me, however, they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, in places where they hung out, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in a state, saying that they treat their customers as family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silent and silent.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets of $327 billion, in bankruptcy management, and as last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that owns savings investments worth $440 billion, looking for a rescue buyer.
In fear of a further collapse, the office and shop clerks who stood before me brought their bar to a bank that is considered a safe harbour, a bank that is responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Very normal New Yorkers have acquired flowing financial latrine in the last few weeks.
A woman who made phone calls in my Chinese tribal market referred with so much confidence to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and their abstinent-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were blazing about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my living block, came from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm out of risk."
Muslim tombs damaged during legal slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian right-wing Austrian Liberal Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, to represent the organisation "Citys Against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of the grave damage at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend at the extreme right-wing parties, of significant profits in the parliamentary election of the country.
On the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in an action organized, according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminals consider this to be an attempt to conceal the motive of extremists driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" about the news of the grave damage that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan was at the end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is taking place in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right-wing parties who received almost 30% of the votes, fought for a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign, and some of their speeches were criticized by opponents as hostile.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on headcloths and burkas and even announced his aversion to food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections and stating that the extreme rights are the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Restricted travel for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, convicted of child sexual abuse, was prohibited from travelling to France and Spain.
Judge Glitter imposed a six-month lock on him after he informed the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were granted to impose a travel ban last Thursday after they presented evidence to the judges of Glitter's conviction for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name of Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
EIn Speaker of the Court of Justice, said: "On Thursday, September 25, the police asked Kent at Ashford District Court for permission to prevent travel abroad from Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the Register for Sexual Offenders, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a prison sentence of 5 years.
The police in Kent said she wouldn't discuss individual cases or glitter's possible place of residence in the country.
A spokesman from Kent's Police Unit said, "Police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the primary concern of the Kent police to protect Kent's residents and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through passport control and he flew after some time to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, on August 22nd, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to request that he register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no armor, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who renounce concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
Artists on the one hand
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the public, I know when I can find typical gestures for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the strength of the hands that are worried because they are not entering the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatricals of some stage productions with singers, dancers and guitarists. On this side, he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the programme of the month of photography of the flamenco, reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is becoming ever greater from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people' can be any human being, but when you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
All normal people on the portraits are artists who are able on stage to communicate passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
In order to hold the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character are in her heart.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera'.
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remind of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, which gives the image the modernity and the idea, as the Bauer flamenco understands: `Music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, after a certain something that becomes visible in the form of listening, of being, and was the firm goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of the El Fotómata in the coming time.
Known personalities in flamenco include Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selections of nearly seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of the flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to access this idea two years ago and to realize it as 'portrait of the veterans of sport' ('SportART project').
Although the concepts of the `Flamenco-people' project are different, the photographer is very fond of taking photos, getting to know them and putting me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genus.
You meet or knock on people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a couple of minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.'
Today's flamenco portraits, entitled `Flamenco-people', are exhibited in the El Fotómata Gallery, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he's just writing is "a gloomy thing."
He does not yet know where the novel's action takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Cassant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is dealing with is `unfortunate' and `all points out that he would not have to write the novel'.
`If I had thought, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at some point', so he concluded his participation in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival and most of the people present gave their voice to it, is compared to the old edition of `Our Mutual Friend' and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theater.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had an audience in front of him who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to be able to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature was created from 'extraordinary adventure', from 'goodness to read' and 'more to experience than before'; how he writes and 'discipline' keeps up to 'lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what 'remembers' are the basis for his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is no `how' to measure and know how to change the way books change life, `but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', stressed Vargas Llosa, who claimed that it creates 'effects' and 'brings people apart even more', so I asked the writers `not to leave the light' and 'take responsibility' for his vocation `.
At the Pozoblanco festival, the weather did not play with it: bullfights fell off in part.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfight, with which the feast in Pozoblanco was to be concluded, was moved to yesterday morning.
The organiser, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, has decided to postpone the bullfight festival.
Thus the festival was suspended from the constant weather, so two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned bullfight could not be celebrated.
The group of Matadors consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which had succeeded him more by galloping than by his bullfight art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, most of the audience responded to his second fight with Buh-Rufen.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape control of their car, loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago ten.
Traffic checks in Ertzaintza, in the district of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers called on the drivers of the car to stop and then they took the flight.
It looked like they wouldn't have to stop with the charge of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police followed her and arrested one of the drivers, the man, who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as reported by the Basque State Ministry of Interior.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the traffic police of the Álava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the town of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped a few kilometres on the outskirts. At the moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee across a country road into a forest area.
The police of the town of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of Hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to the exact laboratory analysis and weighing of the bundles at other police stations.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was `doubled' so that it did not correspond to the marking given in the car documents, and that an additional arrest was carried out for counterfeiting of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigation to make the arrest of the second suspect who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A.A.J. was taken to a police station for interrogation and will be brought to the prison judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of an unknown medication.
One witness observed how she tried quite strangely to get out of her parking gap in Montecito, reported the magazine `People'.
The Witness told us in detail that Locklear `after 4:30 p.m., he pushed through the accelerator and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking gap, and when she drove back, she took some pictures of her sunglasses'.
A little later, the witness, who at first probably didn't realize that Locklear stopped on a nearby road and left the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'lived in fear of Locklears'.
When the police line came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street and thus blocked traffic.
`They seemed to be unorientated', so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed herself cooperative, excessive alcohol abuse was excluded from the first moment. `As a result of the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', says the spokesman.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined and transferred to a local detention centre at around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic after treatment for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left should be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and Member of the United Left, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after he was accused of doing business with family members.
`In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who will have to take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out the way the party must have in relation to the one who so far sits as city councillor in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the necessity of 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the rules violations that Silva might have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases maintain maximum transparency'.
With regard to this topic, he stressed that the education 'has a strict ethical code for all public offices'.
`Sangre de mayo': hero book by Garcia
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci presents in `Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros invested in filming.
In this way, the Cinematist has tried to 'present a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci today explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of actors.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and will be shown later on the station Telemadrid as a four-hour mini-series.
José Luis Garcia, a great fan of Galdós's literature, assured that thanks to this film his `children' dream was fulfilled. This he owes Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid, to film a memorial film for the second century celebration on November 2nd in Madrid. Especially because the story is based on `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million, made for shooting by the autonomous community of Madrid, Garci, as he was able to present the 'one time opportunity' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing, presents the image of 'confused Spain', which sought the wrong leader for the struggle, because the people had been left behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII'.
However, the Cinematist regrets that one could not expect financing like `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as `Sangre de mayo') so some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garcia worked almost his entire career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garcia, who was also a film director in `Volver a empezar', has contributed through his usual workings: he stood on stage with the actors, with whom one must first try before shooting and for those who had not made casting, he appeared to provide `depressive' and respect, `part of the job of the film director is to provide help in the theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many actors he hits in `Sangre de mayo' must repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (one of which he won), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year in front of the Academy of Hollywood will represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de billar francés', nor the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
`At first you believe that you are working for the offspring, later you realize that it is only for the benefit, and now you are satisfied when you have produced a film', Garcia explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother was Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in Triana, and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first women fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and stood for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested to me this role, which seemed impossible to me.'
"We are not trying to tell you about her life, save her spirit," said the flamenco dancer.
Her dance backgrounds helped me a lot in flamenco.
`The dancing of the butterfly' appeared to me like Guajira, for example, or `the dancing of the serpent' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area, she claims.
The production counts with two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel in one of her ideas, as he did in `La puerta aberera'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work exceptionally with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honoured.'
The production also counts with musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he `takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were divas, in which he always falls in love.'
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
`I wanted to call her back, because I think she is one of the women who have a tremendous influence on a particular era and whose works today no one can appreciate anymore, and therefore even less', Bayón claims.
The show will take place today at 20:30 at the Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the death of the two.
Thus, the new edition of this work is concluded by the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón, by the International Congress held in New York, by the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and by the travelling exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which opened in May and after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented during the International Congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more famous.
The U.S. can imagine well without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and from the prevailing notion of American cinema, which was abandoned at that time, came from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic notion and followed her.
Look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he withdrew in 2007.
And he knew he was very ill.
Nevertheless, it was a big hit for everyone.
`What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend', Robert Redford said crying, `my life and my country were the greatest troubles of his life.'
No one was afraid to make themselves ridiculous or exaggerate.
As the `father' of cinema and home country, he died in a sad moment in which there was fear of terrorists and of the collapse of the market, in which the American self-esteem of the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity was reduced.
If in this hard time, without virtue, few people remain who can be admired, then you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was officially an enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various losses as well as profits: from the foundation that dedicated itself to the fight against drugs and in honour of his son from the first marriage that died of overdose was founded up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country in which it took him a lot of effort to fight against a deadly dietary culture.
A wide wave of wonder blows over Hollywood without considering nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the entire era.
The English director Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar award winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
`We've left the largest of us all', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who try to trust today to live as Paul Newman lived: receiving high demands for justice, leading a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful, although there were certainly many ways to be.
`Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have Filet at home?', he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily usual in America.
`From all the great roles he played to none he was as proud as those of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and the philanthropic,' they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are lacking.
Yes, the dream of many of us organizing some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not right!
She was called the perfect road, and after my assessment, she was the worst road with everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you would pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it out, that would clearly not have happened.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket collection that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem to me to be bad either, but if they let you do it, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic congestion on the street).
I don't think so.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis only small, much cheaper shirts were decided to buy from less fabric?
So good, things like these are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to get them back.
In addition, in these 40 minutes of waiting for rain, it was time to try to organize a popular uprising and attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people pneumonia and some like me will not even appear at the classification in time because of this chip I got, I can already think that the output has been wrongly stamped.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, I would never notice that road.
So I think we're going to dream of a city that's well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference' organised by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and the human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is however capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft this is a route planner to move on the company's campus). The system respects what it hears during entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also include those present after the discussions in the groups.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that conducts her conversation, and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, we talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just a finding, considering that Microsoft added one or another feature and 'extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
The Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, it was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Lately many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to function simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his 'dead', not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention every time to the operating system, more attention to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the 'windows' environment.
What is the use of half of existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not excessive, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, no doubt. I give a small example of it.
The photo of this place I made in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refresher, a sign is attached: `Your search. Our future'. It printed a request to use its own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft’s employees, Google, used them for online searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso bought it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `Der Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to list the countless stars performances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a sharp beard that had raised heavy weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and tailed.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First of all, because of his great name, although she is called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. The legend tells that the name formation is connected with sport and is derived from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' surpasses all because of its outstanding cotton, because of its distinctive Unisex cut and stands out by a small Belgian flag (to be recognized) that these T-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And respect, the Belgian company not only focuses on the production of `tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with stripes, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use them as underwear.
They're very attractive.
`I want to be a young mother; I do not worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister, did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is delicate, but full of joy of life.
At present, the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved there her residence and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in the fashion that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short courses.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, and also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner in Valentinos honors.
A very intense working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I, are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I am happy to go through a city and observe women as they are clothed, as they combine their garments, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything meets in one and these areas have many similarities.
Since I was little, I was excited about the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother's to get around in the wardrobes of my aunt and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothing.
You know, we dancers like having our own style in class and at the rehearsals to look into the mirror and feel good.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You've recently become 30, haven't you fallen into a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I feel better than ever, I feel better than thirty years old.
I think the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've been doing the things I've been doing since I was a kid, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about becoming a mother, right?
For a long time I have known that I am becoming a mother because it demands my body and also I want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great happiness and teach it with much love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep an eye on the works you participated in and were shot last year.
That is exactly the way it is and I would like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, of course, which cannot be immediately.
I very much hope that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you.
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of their organization `Women for a better world' and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection for Mango were auctioned to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
I'm the one she knows would tell you that they don't agree.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this grand-hearted thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do so too.
What is needed to support women in the Third World.
The motorists, who can be held back because of the alcohol level, will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The Authority has ordered that the driver who had three official penalties for the alcohol level install in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunk state. If he is alcoholic, the car does not jump.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the Public Prosecutor’s report. According to them, it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
The aim is to re-socialize the driver, which is why he is getting a course for re-education of traffic behaviour.
The Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Motor Vehicle Safety will also participate in it, in addition to the public prosecutorate-general's experience.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of motorists who were more than once exposed to alcohol because of driving returned to control.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents autostart if the driver has done alcohol tests; or if a concentration of alcohol is found which is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by those who impose the penalty.
In this context, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices already in the first year after its introduction prevent up to 65% of the standard infringements.
In Spain, 115 lives can be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it became a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, legislative reform can be carried out on the usual basis, yet a reform of the basic law is called for, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, not in any store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Only tomorrow will the House of Representatives vote because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
With British time, at 17:40, at the time planned by the program, next to the Presidium's hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF Airport, the Spanish Air Force aircraft landed with the Prince and Princess of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced to use the hand as a umbrella to see the royal couple leaving the plane.
Directly on the gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A couple of hours ago I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the prince and the princess of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time of day. You're from here or something.
No, she's the Spanish, but she lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, that's very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 soldiers of the Navy, who surrender the hall of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair woven by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', perhaps was told that it is expected a thunderstorm in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official sequence is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, she is waiting for a reporter from Mexican television who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly excellent fashion designer and Bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Awards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the show window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris yesterday and almost crying because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is located in London.
So many events have happened, which are connected with the fact that one would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart broken by the pain, because recently his brother died, pulled himself together. He attracted the suit from the fashion house and had some jewelry from ELAH that were stunning. He held himself by the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the house Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier that he ended up with the Baron of Red sign without jackets, because jackets they borrowed the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, has hurryed to the store and had a pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet samples, so she got excited, remembered the old days, grabbed a pole and made a kind of 'grand plae'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always arouses stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own sheets and towels) at the Internacional Hotel in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la, that's life.
1001 Advice against stress
There is not a thousand, but a possibility more to forget chaotic everyday life.
And if there are few, all of them are collected in a book where it says how to get some relaxation. The book comes into the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but worse is the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of shutting down from the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga treatments, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents the entire list of options adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 opportunities to relax' and so comes the rest that conveys the book into the bookstores of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Those who believe that it is impossible to achieve rest in areas such as workplaces with the help of personal contacts are thus opposed to this manual of such beliefs.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your vein no longer rises to restore the body's balance and stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit on the sofa, shut down the brain and concentrate on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children speak at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be scared, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called talking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason to cause this phenomenon.
Often connections with other phenomena in sleep are sought, such as nightmares, panicking fear at night, Enuresis noctura (bed-nothing at night), talking in sleep sought, but there is no reason for it.
As we have already mentioned, there may be very high fiber, stress or excess.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you talk quietly in individual words, whisper or it may be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions ).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended that the child be observed and advised by a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus results.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, sleep apnoea or stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple prevention measures:
Do not try to raise the child before sleeping.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
For those nervous children who are recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
If talking occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will not be able to remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, sleeps, so it rests.
Think about it when it shows up scared after a couple of appearances, it is recommended to let yourself be advised or find out what reason the child has for the fear.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and obtain more information.
Thus you will not be able to achieve anything, because if the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming of and why it says that they are therefore cautious in interpreting the information and the conclusions that you draw from it.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you'll hear it at night and know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses... at last
After a long course of thirst, Illhäuser is finally back on a successful course on the field.
Without great effort the yellow blacks played numerous goals and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, during which the attackers had difficulty showing their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot just passed at the angle, Illhäuser was to dominate the game with ease, and alternately managed to challenge the defense of Denmark with a remote shot, then brain with a high-pass, and Romain with a shot with a foot pointed.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with first two goals fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the ill-houses by Marais, who stood exactly right to accept a ball that had been defeated in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the Irish goaltender should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which required his teammates to continue playing numerically underplay.
However, Denmark did not know how to exploit this and did not present any major problems to an Illhueusian eleven, which only withdrew a little to `compress' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a large mess.
Sarkozy meets angry Fischer
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take another trip to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several ports in Brittany and Normandy on Monday, the French President decided to meet with their representatives at the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he would come with 'concrete suggestions'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee, set up by the Breton fishermen, to enforce measures in view of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached an average record value of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elysée Palace David Martinon `the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their businesses to become competitive again, and to secure the working conditions and the payment of seafarers'.
Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with determination.
Tuesday morning they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused congestion of almost ten kilometres.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle Island did not break off.
The Quiberon peninsula was demarcated with a lock.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination to burn tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishmen did not leave, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the major total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Guilvinec Crisis Committee must decide on the reaction to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the National Fisheries Committee who did not support their movement.
`The strike will continue', because `the fishermen will not give up' and `do not want to go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Committee on Fisheries.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the liter about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 years of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes also welcomed the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threat of recession, to pose a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its supply forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of size from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider spending more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the US Monetary Authority, is considering spending more than 15% of its assets to repay the 85 billion dollars it has received.
AIG is ready to control the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its international life insurance and pension provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors met on Sunday evening to verify possible sales.
The AIG could not be confirmed.
Among the assets that AIG would potentially separate from are its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the transatlantic holdings reinsurer, as well as its real estate assets and its investments in private equity, FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG must make quick sales to repay the loans over 85 billion that granted it the federal reserve, including the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the session Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks, a historic case of prices: The Dow Jones lost 6,98%, a loss of almost 800 points that had never been there, and the Nasdag 9,14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777,68 points to 10,365,45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) had been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.
According to the final figures, the index Nasdag, mainly relating to technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1.983.73, and the widespread index Standard & Poors 500 by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
Following the unexpected rejection of the Bank Rescue Plan by the Chamber of Deputies, which should once again allow some stability on the markets, Wall Street, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter, collapsed.
By 228 votes to 205, MEPs refused to give the Secretary-General Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Almost two of the three Republicans rejected his plan.
`This is a bad picture that the Congress is unable to accept,' said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market counted on this plan', added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be 'too late'.
`If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will soon be the Fed's task (the American Central Bank, note Red.) and other central banks to tackle the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions', Brian Bethune warned Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, highlighting the feeling of extreme urgency even more, `that every day, which excites the ruin of a financial enterprise' in the United States `.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the U.S. authorities planned to buy up the banking operations of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and led to emergency measures for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are not only facing an American but a global crisis, added the analyst of the FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The State Treasury's revenue has fallen from 3.632% to 3.827% in the Friday evening within ten years, and revenue within 30 years last evening from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner after points in the first TV duel
Following the first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday, another one followed in order to find out who emerged as a winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television duel for the election of both Republicans and Democrats, which was supposed to be followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite handsome, was not 'bright' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, from which a poll was published on Saturday, says Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), and believes that the Democratic is clearly making the better figure.
Among the still unsolved voters, so those on whom it matters now, Obama emerged from the polls with 39%, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
`It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She's got good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain did not cease to highlight his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy, clearly stressing the 'naïveness' of his opponent in relation to these questions, which were the focus of this first television show.
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he stressed several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican election spots since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without letting himself out of the frame.
He put his ability at the forefront of making good decisions and renewing the image the world has of the United States.
`McCain has still not understood, however, Obama already', this weekend put a democratic campaign spot against the Republicans being accused of not having grasped the full extent of the crisis that burdened the 'American from the street'.
`During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama denounced 20,000 people yesterday, who had gathered in the rain on the occasion of an election in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words `middle stand' or `worker'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom the Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
`The coming week could be a decisive turning point', estimated yesterday by the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton's government, compared the 'good economic instincts' of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crisis is 'the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
Once again, he stressed that he would probably even be able to reduce taxes on 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, were the top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build an installation of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully moved away from the issues arising from the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (EUR 470 billion), which was adopted by the Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
`Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?'
Young people and opposition leaders demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday evening since the closing of the polling stations on the market square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: `The dictator is to resign'.
Some admit that they did not choose at all: 'What good is it if they do what they want with my voice,' says one youngster.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turnaround.
The sanctions, including the non-delivery of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the abandonment of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, it wasn't them.
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the countdown," regretted Juri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If members of the opposition move into Parliament because they were appointed and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore obliged to interfere in the political game, because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
If our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in a crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the turn of the elections, will not recognise the election as valid.
She stressed that voting participation figures appeared to be too high, and that the extension of the voting fee in advance (26% of Minsk voters) had paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that an election has taken place?', asks the leader of Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in Parliament, the ones who are most closely in line with the government's ideas.
The silence of the night drops again over the October Square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulated themselves on their success.
Discussion - The blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of her founding yesterday, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it regained the confidence of the public, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross during the 1980s were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In the face of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Government of Canada launched in February 1994 a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and to develop guidelines to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While Richter Krever was still reluctant to submit his report, at that time several provinces set up a committee to develop a new system for the management of blood preserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started her work, hardly 38% of the people had confidence in the blood-conservation system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and through work in this area during the following years, we have regained public confidence," she says, before proudly stressing that by the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting in accordance with the precautionary principle.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
`And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we are referring to one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, which says that exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease only progresses slowly, as is obviously the case with the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is manifested by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999 no blood was taken from people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proven that this disease is being transmitted over the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied certainly has a meaning.
In 1999, a much more precise technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NSTs), which enable the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibody against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than one week.
Thus, the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize this, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transferring AIDS via blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
`In other words, it means that 12 million blood canisters would have to be distributed before someone was infected with HIV.
As Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preserves every year, it would take more than 24 years for a case of HIV transmission through a blood preserve.
I think you can feel comfortable with this today when you get or write a blood transfusion to restore your health', says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogens can get into the system.
Only last year did the Chikungunya virus appear on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted through insects over the blood.
We need to continuously monitor', Dr. Décary continues, before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient supply in addition to a safe supply.
`The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, of which, on average, only 3% of the population of Quebec is suitable for blood donation.
Every healthy person, who is 18 years of age or older and who meets the eligibility criteria, can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because they have been ill with AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from blood donation for one year.
`With this 3% we manage to get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep it and make it become regular donors.
Life is so hectic today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in blood donation', Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec not only supplies blood preserves, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eye drops and skin, which are almost exclusively used in severe burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Quebec, which is also managed by the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, contains blood from stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases such as leukaemia.
`A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand annually.
`We should probably start to make it available for transplants early next year', Dr. Décary explains, which describes this program of umbilical cord blood loss as very popular.
`Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinals
Montreal's Impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle sounders at the second round, decided to play the quarter finals in the Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio was counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the playoffs of the USL's first league.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute game.
After a first half without a goal for both sides, the midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the sounders.
Let's remember that during the first game of the pre- and playback series on Friday Impact had brought a 2 to 1 defeat to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
In the semifinal, Impact will be measured with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to balance a 3 to 1 deficit in the back game in Minnesota with a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps still entered the semi-final round with a total score ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number one trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn led the attack on the Florida Panther with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 win.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the tricolore into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won by shooting the only goal of the entire shooting.
`I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable. '
`He was too attached to it in the first half of the year, Guy Carbonneau noticed.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.'
Charest sets to the north
The Prime Minister shall not refuse to hold elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected in today's sub-election.
`Move the course of our last great border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday by visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Quebec Party in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, Quebec in `Google Maps' were viewed, maps, etc.
Large funds like during the election period.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude him from holding the elections this fall, even if he said that his calendar was very full.
The 'North Plan' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely the 'new economic area' which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently recently in the Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the north - the northern area at 49th latitude - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, investment sums or precise priorities for future projects.
At most, there are some prospects of what could be more worked on: particularly in water energy, in the forest, but especially in the mining sector, promoted by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charests, the north has `nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `area twice as large as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only near us, it is within us', he stressed how to show clearly that he is seeking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec's connection with the North grew very much, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
`It belongs to us, it is our future', he added after he had taken a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always requested, the Prime Minister told the press.
`This is a traditional attitude pursued by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is provided, I will take this position again on behalf of the government', he said.
Furthermore, 'with climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north', he explained and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be mobile all year round due to the melting of ice.
In the face of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would deal very carefully with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pecist Member of the Ungava) have already begun discussions with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and land resources) takes an important place, took up the work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large meeting, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity for 'a common vision'.
The development of the North will be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be 'regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as being a continuation of those of the Liberal Prime Minister who were in office before him.
`Like the Liberals who were in office before us, we have been thinking about turning the challenges into new growth and development channels.
This was, by the way, one of the ever-increasing topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's takeover of party leadership.
One of the decisions adopted provides for the conversion of the Beauharnois power plant to Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
`From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about reading, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future', said Jean Charest.
The press referred to another conservative project, namely the `Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Hydropower Dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
`This remains among us, but I intend to be there,' he trusted his party members, which led to those whirlwinds.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, has indeed not yet excluded the possibility of holding a vote this autumn, which is possible under the law.
He stressed, however, that his schedule was full, mainly because of a joint Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially from 'constitutional goals', which were adopted without further ado: the PLQ calls in particular for the recognition of the 'speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were adopted with scepticism.
The leader of the Québécois Party, Pauline Marois, has re-emerged the North-Du-Quebec development policy introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, did not apply it.
If she had done so, we would be much further today, Ms. Marois judged Françoise Mercure alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today).
The ADQ has expressed its support for the adoption by the government of a North Plan.
`But what we want is that this will not only be a great idea', the party leader Sébastien Proulx explained in representation of Mario Dumont, who comes back from the holiday today.
Letters - An Displaced Country
Mr. Vic Toews, Ex-'Justiz' Minister (which irony) in cabinet Harper, allowed himself last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shad' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an endless struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration, so to speak with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that, as the only one from all the countries concerned, did not bring home its countryman, who was captured in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things that were being accused of him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and makes a child soldier vegetate under inhumane conditions.
The only one who drops to a court parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are in favour of bringing Omar Khadr home so that he can have a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to torture: they are not interested in the fact that after so many years a young adult will certainly have been mentally broken.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are now experiencing a homelike circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries in front of him like a flag, and that sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morals: you can arbitrarily abuse, torture and incarcerate a Canadian citizen, according to the advice of a head of government, who is only supported by the minority until today (may he be a minority after 14 October ...).
Many voters believe that finding their salvation with a party is preaching virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this discharge, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In her September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice Director General of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine.
This confirms and pursues an orwell logic that the world's largest gold mining company sought a slander complaint of over six million against three authors and a small, medium-sized publishing house with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of slander charges, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, to drive everyone into the ruin that dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter what the process is, the authors and the editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defenses and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactics of these unequal struggles are, moreover, often to ruin the defenders in order to force an understanding arrangement that makes the opposite face kills and also deters anyone who dares to re-examine the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually conducted in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not through the barbs.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent audit teams that could have brought light to this question.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters supporting the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public debate' and, at the same time, ignore the views of this public.
Apparently, in the Vice-President's world, this word only includes the generously paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public, who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does this mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is ready to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many perceive as a lumpy complaint (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada in which they ask them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on freedom to academic research and the discovery of truth, which is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that the rich companies of this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been aware of getting to grips with debates and disagreements and of resolving conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate complaint clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures to limit this kind of unjustified actions.
Rescue action for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
The Bush administration and the leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic recovery plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan of $700 billion to stop the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be adopted by the two chambers of Congress.
The main content is: better control by Members of Parliament over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of used public funds, new arrangements to limit the number of houses held due to arrears of payments, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the senior staff of the supported companies.
The US Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans present in the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
`We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective', explained the Bush administration representative, Henry Paulson.
`It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis on Wall Street', the democrat explained.
`This is the fundamental point: If we do not, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous', the Republican Jew Gregg explained.
Negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, for fear of the effect that a further failure would have had on investors' mood.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part only late in the negotiations, were more in favour of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that they had to be met in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain arrangements for agreement, especially those designed to enable the owners to keep their houses, and those relating to the salaries of the executives of the state-saved companies.
`If you ask the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, that is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary, he said on the American television stations.
When asked on another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The principles I have read [show] that this is one thing that we must all digest, and with which we will be able to advance.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at paying taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis, caused by the placement of a real estate bubble that led to the collapse of high-risk mortgages (subprime) before expanding to other forms of spread bonds (PCAA), and eventually to a freeze of financial power and the ruin of banks and money institutions.
A group of Republican MPs failed last week to make the first attempt to reach agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain `toxic' assets of the societies are only to be secured by the government and not to be bought, it is believed that the dead end will escape.
In order to complete the perspective for everyone in the Congress, it has also been added a provision that, if the government were to lose out with this program within five years, it could then raise new taxes in order to retain the capital invested in it.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which a further 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies, which bring him dividends in the case of profits, and which it can sell again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the option of suspending the deposit procedures for the dwellings that are tied to the real estate loans affected by this plan, as well as setting deadlines for the repayment and the deductions paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Representatives to vote on him today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, there were further votes against this proposal yesterday, both by the Republicans and the Democrats.
'Of course, Washington does not understand us,' said Republican Scott Garett, member of the Chamber's Finance Commission, his constituents.
`Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are asking taxpayers to pay.'
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a group in the Congress called the 'Caucus of the Sceptics', makes things different, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred excellent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, have written to tell us: We ask the Congress not to be under pressure, and to consider carefully which way to go,' he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe once again got the proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary, after the French Bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which is in great difficulty, since it has lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, declared yesterday by Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos.
To compensate, we get a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announcing. '
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was just in the process of instituting another bank that was afflicted by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branches and customer accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be after Northern Rock the second bank that the British government has had to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was long his truss, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor free himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His tenderness, sensitivity and obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a long-term runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 years of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled, and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more carefully in his play, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream should arise.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
After all, an entire country in love with the self-made-man was reflected in the fighter who was wounded in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale at the beginning of the 1950s, and then visited the actor's studio in New York before he had success in theatre, television and soon in cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became the 24-hour race of Mans Zweiter in 1979, and also a symbol of sex, although he lived together with the actress Joanne Woodward in a premiere relationship since 1958.
With him, too, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed and oversensitive star disappear, whose puzzles will never be solved completely.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put the movie lovers this weekend in Taumel, while on the dark screen of memories all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art is constantly changing with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) is once again remembered, and the young man who turned his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) back to Die Katze on the hot sheet filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter-backed memory (1990) is awakened to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who at his age is disturbed by a wedding that did not meet all their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean after his death and made the Newman's 1956 really famous.
This friendly Ganove in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded with the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, it was him.
Still him.
In his life course, epochs unite.
The youth knows him mainly from George Roy Hill's cult film Slap Shot (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
In 2003, Sam Mendes joined the circle as the father of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition.
In contrast to several movie legends, who have withdrawn early enough from the film world, Newman should remain in the saddle for a long time, while Hollywood, his fortune, his prun and his concessions are betrayed.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'Underplaying' when he judged his all too expressive achievements.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles only flew for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: neuroticians, alcoholics, fieslings or desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his slide and his rebellion.
As director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a sensitive portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated to him his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
During the flood of honours that took place yesterday about Newman ergoss, his close friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said extremely much: `His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generousness and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great champion of civil rights, of environmental protection and of independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood drifting, is going down.
We have often seen him standing in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this is considered rather tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
The profits from his sales were still in need in his Children's Foundation.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to shooting.
He left behind his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Immer and until the very end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. '
And for us, it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and widest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János's tender and his accomplices begin.
In particular, the accused is accused of involvement in organised crime, grossly negligent harm and commercial fraud, and other criminal acts, including document counterfeiting.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the funds derived from the invitations to tender were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often charged with counterfeit invoices.
State funds and self-government grants - a total of HUF 65 million - are supposed to have been partly invested in the cash registers of the organization Fiatal Balloldal, partly in the private banks of individual companies.
As announced by the investigating authorities, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender funds were drawn up and the associations were not to comply with their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were faked.
The bill blocks were purchased at the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the bills was decided on the tour north of the Lake Platte, to which István Lados was sent by János Aufschlag.
In the course of this "exploration tour", Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He demanded invoices on consumption to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest, based on these templates.
These invoices are supposed to have been manipulated by the majority of István Lados and his accomplice, András  oili, the latter having been responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "Exploring Tour" was a beer shop.
Like two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have hosted the 90-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the manager of the company indicates that such a large group would not have integrated into the premises at once.
Another invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious errors in form and content.
At a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are supposed to have stayed.
The imagination of the falsifiers were apparently as close as it was to the Pigal Kft., a catering company whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőrt and Hoppá do not appear at all at all.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas told Hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to him that it was forged documents when documents were submitted to him by the Public Prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp."
And further on: Apart from shape defects, the fact was also wrong that the operation should have housed one hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to accommodate so many people.
Also, food had been shown on the invoice, with the restaurant no longer in operation for a long time.
The eminent counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency, which they take into account, only offers trips abroad, and so have indicated that Hungary's travel on the cash payment account was contrary to the company's accounting practice.
In addition, as reported in the course of the investigations, they have also quoted VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services, which relate to a country outside the EU, are free of VAT.
The amount of VAT paid to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation was in total wrong on four invoices issued by Hotel Révfölöp Kft., since the company charges only 25 percent VAT instead of only 15 percent VAT, and the employees only issue machine invoices, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been lost to the "accounting companies" was that in a case they had indicated "goods transport" as performed, although this is not offered by the investment consultancy company, the prosecutor informed.
Further errors in form - false invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont, could be exposed as counterfeits.
Likewise in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing director claimed never to have issued the bills.
Another "wrong" is the failure of the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: at the time (2001), this society was precisely in resolution, when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyezület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore claimed not to have issued the invoices themselves.
Consciously falsified
The other group of accountants are persons who were quite aware that they had to make fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to present the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft, which is currently also in liquidation, is expected to have also worked with Aufschlag and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH was supposed to have provided the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület associations with fake invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which related to non-performance.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, but this has been forgotten by the parties concerned in their documents.
The third group of auditors shall comprise persons directly connected to the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest, which is not found there.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices for the sale of IT components in the total value of HUF approximately 18 million in the period October to December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is supposed to have been the buyer of these invoices.
The company's managing director was a Romanian who was also expected to provide the company's documents to Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has been able to issue invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the clubs Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to collect their own equivalents.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. are supposed to have been founded on Iván Kubatov's express wish by Romanian masons.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, according to the defendant, in the absence of any contracts.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his partner, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's start-up documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov will have issued 15 invoices in total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the bill and VAT each.
Even the company Szi-Beri Bt. is supposed to have misused fictitious invoices for the exhibition - in this case the invoices were submitted to the applications of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarszágert submitted their applications in January 2006 to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but these amounts have been used for purposes other than purposes.
In order to cover this up, they submitted five fictional invoices to the TMA of the Works Team Kft.
By the way, these invoices were ensured during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the course of the negotiations, some of the defendants are now charged with a confession of the way in which they have been falsified, as they have already been filed before the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Sensation could be if the Chief Prosecutor decides to award János a full confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still outstanding.
The question therefore remains open whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him on the reimbursement of most of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether a grant is prepared to take responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the contract will now be played by the "injured" after his attempts to alleviate the detention and house arrest had been encountered on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused far greater damage to the economy and who have not paid it, are on the open ground, or at least under house arrest, supplementation remains prohibited.
The Psychology of Surrendering - or why we are willing to pay more
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bid.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play Lotto, while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the volunteers were examined by functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, however, an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain cortex, was measured in the event of loss of the auction, where the overshooting of the opponent plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore felt that the price increase could be explained by avoiding overreaction of the strike.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group also carried out investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should participate against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their efforts.
Another group was also promised $15 reward, in case they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
Thus, the difference between the two groups was merely that the emphasis was on winning, while the emphasis was on losing.
However, as proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, the members of the "opposite losing" group were prepared for higher stakes than those in the control or "win" group.
"These results cannot be derived from previous economic theory.
In fact, these have only justified the practices observed at auctions with the joy of winning or avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should your doctor visit you?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated to be one hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - inflammation of the liver and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from one another.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different species: in hepatitis A and E, by the digestive tract (for example by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vagina secretory or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B at any rate, against virus C there is no vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain, and break-in irritation.
After that, the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine darkens, and recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Around 1 million people worldwide die from the much more severe diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected patients are in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, because the pathogen secretly destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups where this disease is more common: those who have undergone blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooers.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the home doctor for the first signs of unknown origin.
In due course, the disease can be cured, the virus can be eradicated, thus preventing the risk of infection and preventing cancer.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 for the first time of patient representation worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, its emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
How recent research has shown that religious belief works like a kind of "merciful" that should have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It has been investigated to what extent faith in God influences human pain, reported the British magazine "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
A brain scan technology could even prove that the Catholics could activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would give rise to some kind of religious trance while they chose Vinci's picture because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt calming.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during this time, while watching either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that, at the sight of the Mother of God, they felt "in security" as if they were "careful," and they felt "peace and peace".
During the viewing of religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than they had seen Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be caused with other, powerful images, even with the atheists, that you should just find the corresponding photo.
"We had to find a picture that triggers very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and it does so in many cases too," Wright said.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image would have on the pain regulation of the faithful by Leonardo or another comparable painter.
Would the high quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you tell about yourself
On the occasion of their tenth birthday, Google can rightly assert that it can be found in people's pockets as well as through their heads in heaven: she knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialist doctors they go, and what they move.
And that's not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics, plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he makes it clear: these would overlook the very essence of the web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus to get closer to the company's original goal of "ordering all the information of this world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google was still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?", but software programs are not yet able to answer because they don't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that, as part of their internet searches, the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "personalized search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his or her own search history and to use it later so that the results can be generated much more precisely, and the same logic is also based on the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends tailored products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data abuse - "When you look at what I'm doing" - some people are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company that causes fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or the desire to rebel against the power that many Internet users are rejecting.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but are also passed on to third parties in the event of the event, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
One example of this was the recent approach to paedophilia in Brazil, during which Google provided information to the Brazilian government, which was collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the paedophilia to be identified.
However, users who were concerned about personal rights were able to breathe up in May when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully brought the FBI to trial: according to this, Google cannot be forced to release information to the FBI on a secret request with any constitutional point in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully produced 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but it has been denied the list of individual users, respectively their web and search terms list for two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy by using Google services, the company is whining with the objection due to the conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even though both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require any identification codes for its users, and makes its services available free of charge so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be far more attractive, youthful, and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks are seeing the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet, a relationship which has become particularly acute in recent years thanks to the term "web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is nothing but collaboration, saying that users deliberately leave behind traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average youth can manage their profile on several community portals at the same time - from Facebook via Xanga, they can connect with each other through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are located on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When you look at the party photos last night, the girlfriend will soon find out with whom her disloyal friend has enjoyed, or the employee will be released because in his blog he only makes too honest his anger about corporate governance - one thing is certain: The term "private sphere" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever conducts an online life is what he gives of himself - that's how you could formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even to bypass the Google monopoly, can do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that, although accessing Google’s search engine, deliberately leaves no traces.
Not very few people deliberately register on community pages, so that they are not found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be dealt with with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threaten advertising agency revenues, and the increasingly faster-implemented services not only cause Microsoft, but also other software developers to collapse.
However, critical viewers also find the disturbing counterpoles: for example, the management has completely rejected a protest from employees after the fees of the company’s own kindergarten were doubled, and the management said that several times the management of the employees was too expensive. However, all this is quite mildly saying that Google even went to the knees before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed with an agreement that all of the regime’s critical hits, or those that violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The company's internal regulations are that no new service is being offered in advance, but only when it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could strongly reverse the situation: while some think that Google's book and magazine scanning or archiving project is now assuming dimensions that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already provide the material - for example, "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes a future in the best Orwellian way, in which a person gets close thanks to Google-related data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd with the elimination of traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected to have helped eliminate the traces, informed the spokesman of the Police Commissioner Borsod on Tuesday.
The young people were on standby and are currently being charged with the aid.
According to information from the MTI News Agency, these are two girls who defend themselves on the free foot.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment for up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of deliberately murdering several persons out of greed.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, did not want to settle his debts, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to an area in Ózd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the crime of a long hand - this also proves that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the crime weapon as well as the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange to Make Purchase Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the 100% purchase of the share packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer made by Poland despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, but it wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily "E15", Polish offers include the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers to date.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that of all the interested parties the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he also did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at SEK 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European papers already spoke of "second September 11".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, said "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to put his own party behind him for the draft law, which was supposed to bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11".
Parts of the press in Madrid also located the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the Congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will have no political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example the Geneva term "day-shower".
While some countries could still make available their money institutions' rescue packages and save banks with taxpayers' money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are in favour, no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralise their control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to weak money institutions, the Vienna "The Standard" recalls. Furthermore, according to the newspaper, the concerns are becoming more and more realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers would now have to get a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which now sweeps like a tsunami across the old continents.
Although the "savers" would not have to "return" at once with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to determine in which case it would be reasonable to use taxpayers' money to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to prevent accidents, if not to imitate barrier sensors from the nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project inspired the Nissan engineers of Hummeln to create new systems to prevent accidents was presented.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C type B biomimetic system controlled by autoboters, a mini-car, equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers seized the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180 degree field of vision within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is recorded in parts of seconds, and the autobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
Contrary to previous systems, this manoeuvre takes place purely instinctively.
"If not, the autobot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Autobot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently considered unavoidable.
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of bees when they avoid other bees.
And this has to be done in a fraction of a second.
However, avoiding, unlike the bees, can not be up, down, or even diagonal - it can be only two-dimensional, only in the direction of turning the tyres.
While the bees here are open to endless possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotational movement, respectively acceleration and braking, at the autobot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy-efficient, and therefore have a longer lifetime than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process some inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using previous manoeuvres, so it constantly uses only a handful of KB memory.
No gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories are required.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan, will be in production as a series within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the destination.
A Name for the Sinner Child
Now, the written version of the $700 billion rescue package law is available, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying the banks' bad loans.
In the first round half of the money is to be spent.
At a meeting, which ended on Saturday after midnight, the local East Coast, Congressmen have reached an agreement on the 700 billion dollar rescue package after several days of debate, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, President of the American House of Representatives, and said that the agreement had only to be signed.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
The financial minister, Henry Paulson, said the result was that the programme will have an impact and it will be efficient, but more must be done. According to Pelosi, this was not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing the rudder of the economy apart.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Washington Time Sunday evening 8 am (mid-European time Monday 2 am), but did not trigger an altitude flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, first, the House of Representatives will vote on the draft law to stabilise the economy of 2008, then the Senate will be on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House.
The program, however, deviates from the Bush administration's original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once on the purchase of bad, credit-driven securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of credit-paid, bad securities, and the President is to decide on the remaining USD 100 billion.
The programme is being reviewed by a separate Commission, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of the Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined approach: it can buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgaged securities, or other "toxic" loans at the same time.
As reported by the competent persons of the Ministry, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the resources to be provided, and the companies pay the appropriate fees for the damages to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said that the law defines the necessary funds in such a way that up to $700 billion can be made available as an emergency aid for the American financial system, be it for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, according to Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks that are in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can count on the government to shorten their payments, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang.
A reduction in salaries will only be possible in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the ministry purchases in the course of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed unless the retired bank manager is expelled to the pension.
In case of a direct purchase of bad loans, the government will aggressively turn on to ensure that management salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also shows that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions refer only to new agreements so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that reductions in manager salaries are regulated by law, commented the Democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, on the measure.
The State acquires ownership rights in the participating banks so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced, as they can participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank are improved.
The draft law requires the President to submit a proposal to the Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money at all, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven by the same people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
According to the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared with the previous month, and in comparison with August 2007, sales prices rose by 12.9 per cent.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008, down 3.9% from the previous year's prices.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month.
Even the sales prices of the manufacturing industry have increased little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was in leather goods (2.8 per cent) - primarily in bags and belts - and the increase was 4.6 per cent, and in footwear prices went up by 2.5 per cent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly boosted prices for chemicals and production (1.6 percent).
A fall in the price of crude oil (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent) and wood processing (0.1 percent) was recorded.
Prices in papermaking, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the major domestic markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly as a result of the price increase for gas introduced on 1 July.
If the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry are viewed annually, the prices of crude oil processing have risen most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, an increase of 13.2 per cent was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages and tobacco was 11 per cent.
A fall in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The extent of the price increase in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
In total, prices in manufacturing rose by 10.2 per cent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7% year-on-year.
In the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in the real estate sector (0.7 per cent) in August.
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices went up by 0.3 per cent, while in the energy and processing sectors they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8%) compared to the reference period of 2007.
In the consumer goods sectors, an increase in prices of 6.8 per cent was recorded, with fixed goods recording a fall in prices of 1.4 per cent.
Industry's export prices, measured in Forint, rose by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decrease of 3.9 per cent year on year.
The domestic currency was 1.7% weaker than the euro, 7.1 percent weaker, and compared to the August 2007 price it was 7.5 percent stronger than the euro, with the dollar even 15.9 percent stronger.
No more visas to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the U.S.-H. visumab coming into force around the 12th of January, as declared by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in front of representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her opinion, "Now all depends on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in time in overseas."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permits in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is starting negotiations in Washington today.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, whom she will present to the Republic of Hungary the "Middle Merit Cross with Star" and also talks with the foreign policy advisors of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support on Sunday for the $700 billion rescue package for banks, but there are also politicians who are calling for the Minister of Finance to resign.
The Congress and government representatives announced, after days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning, that they had reached an agreement on the bank-rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the start of the frozen credit market, have become the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suited than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCains Hoch, who gave him the presentation of Vice President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, has melted at the same time.
At an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would adopt the $700 billion bill quickly.
He stressed that the plan also included the passages of consumer protection that he supported with.
"We now need to act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, the entire industry, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" he said to 35,000 viewers.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic vision "obsolut".
In an interview given to the transmitter ABC, McCain explained: "We will all have trouble squeezing (...) but nothing is definitely no alternative".
The Republican Senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a supervisory commission for the finance minister, as well as the limitation of the fees for top managers - something he had insisted on.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives would probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - "Der Spiegel" commented on the weak performance of CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (mirror.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for CSU's dramatic defeat in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys her fathers".
According to the renowned politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over its office.
The Christian-socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The outbreak of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but on Sunday something went to an end, which was, however, quite precisely ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party
For ten years ago, in 1998, CSU fell to 47.7% and fell below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This repeated itself three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections, in other words in the much-cited Stoiber era.
The modernization carried out by the CSU in the state of Germany has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this already 40 years ago, but at the pace of this, they were very appreciative. However, without any impact the secularization, the educational success, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain true to the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with an increase in the number of options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - the only voters within the camp have become more critical and self-sufficient.
It is striking that in the last few weeks the classical citizens have just expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with Abitur and university degrees.
The CSU's support fell to just under 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its article entitled "Who with Who? the head of the party is holding back in coalition questions" about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to discussions in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish themselves in relation to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public-law television the party leaders hardly let their cards look.
SPÖ Chief Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible very well - in some Länder and in the social partners this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP chief vice-chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters had chosen the bowl-molterer course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer has, however, responded cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said when Faymann tried to interfere with internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in coalition, is currently fully open, and these issues should be discussed internally.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider showed up in all directions.
"In order to prevent red and black, we are ready to take on government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which will be held this year by the French Presidency of the European Union, has begun.
In her speech addressed to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fides member of the European People's Party, drew attention, in particular, to the educational community, which is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children, is also the greatest obstacle to their application.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to Fidesz’s press office, Járóka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be forced away from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have secondary education, and due to poor primary education only a small part of them can reach a university degree".
Járóka also stressed that education was a fundamental human right, which would play a key role in upholding other human rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the view of the honourable Member, it is important for this connection to become aware of as wide a circle as possible - Roma and non-Roma.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and by income tax and turnover tax they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - poor and segregated teaching must be stopped" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member has said, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of disaggregation in the education sector, which requires proper compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We need to break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as a full citizen," Járóka called.
Since last year's Berlin conference, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for advancing the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also at national level, within the meaning of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace to Time
The fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein is decided at the end of October
In spite of the election debakel, no heads still roll, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the staff debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17-percent loss of votes will be decided at the extraordinary Congress on the last weekend of October.
But the much sloppy duo already made it clear that it doesn't want to stick to their armchairs.
They want to calm down the angry group and the party base, which one day after the Bavarian tsunami demanded personal consequences in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career point - the Christian-Social Union still reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4% of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was "single directors" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
The Conservatives remain the determining force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of internal party restructuring, the potential successor Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which will conduct exploratory talks with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "free voters" via a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the list "Free Voters" the Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislature whose anti-stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo first used to serve the determined politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far pulled the threads out of the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU President called 28 September the "brightest day of his political career".
On Monday Huber made a few toxic remarks towards CDU - in his opinion, the CSU would have deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed much to the success at national level in 2005, is not put back on track with a joint force act, Merkel cannot become Chancellor again in September 2009 after the Bundestag elections.
Merkel, who did not make a mockery of her disappointment at the fiasco, believes that the CSU's loss of land will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats goes on.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko Opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition has made it to the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability of Alexander Lukashenko's country, but the OECD suspects illegality in counting votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
Although the law of the ten million people's state has come to an end for decades without opposition, the counter-party under the name "Vereinde Democratic Forces" (ODS) in front of yesterday's elections has been seriously hoping that Lukashenko, who, during the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional change in 2006, had already renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time, this time some Members of the opposition in Parliament would "allow" them.
Therefore, the ODS has even distanced from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly economically dependent on imports of natural gas from Russia. Credits have even been taken up to alleviate price increases, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the country, to the Russians. Against the background of the opposition’s expectations, Ukraine’s desire to improve its relationship with the EU was thus expressed after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have banned entry into the EU because of the anti-democratic political system.
The report of the OECD elections, which highlighted the positive movements rather than the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections - provided temporary relaxation.
However, already on Monday, the OECD's rapid report criticised the campaign - that is to say, the opposition is not in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
Despite this, the opposition is able to recognize a improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been put on the loose for example, and Minsk is ready for even smaller confrontations with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two territories to be independent for one month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich on our paper.
According to the 2006 presidential election opposition candidate, it is desirable to continue, although "the powerful were afraid to leave only one opposition in Parliament".
The opposition does not plan to protest against the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We have many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way of distribution stones, but yet I see that more and more people support change, even the older ones" - said Milinkewitsch, pointing out that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" which is warning the silence of a cemetery begins to burst," says Milinkewitsch.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Community Mission of Independent States, said to the news agency Ria Novosti, "People believe the deeds, not the words." The absence of the opposition was therefore proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Being breakfast before work now"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi, there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those slumbers who first stamp and then go for coffee during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Law was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Council Presidency.
">"Territable doors are a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," says Brunetta once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no opposition from officials, the Secretary-General said: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides".
All in all there is now no more breakfast during working time; stop with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Senior Committee on Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
The Minister of Rome announces that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60.000 people per year are more present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration.
"their wage-earners - as the minister said - have been twice the size of the private sector over the last 8-10 years and well above the inflation rate".
In the meantime, thousands of officials have gathered to counter the Brunetta decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiled with figures on lower absenteeism at work - the consumer center writes - the people of the 'active mulch' are growing continuously.
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable public service officials have come together to declare war on the unlawful standards of the decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) will be fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's renewals challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day, 2500 accidents at work occur in Italy, three people die and 27 people remain incapacity for life.
For 2007, the data of Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work amounted to approximately 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as it is caused by murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutalati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all the provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work in order to draw the attention of the social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how decisive the question of prevention at the workplace is," confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del Lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to preventing employment, protecting injured workers, assisting the families of the victims and raising public awareness".
"An indignant "bast" has risen to this point; understandable in the case of tragedies, which, in terms of their order of magnitude, trigger some whirlwinds in the media and public participation. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events, which can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics".
Napolitano does not hide that "in any case there is also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
A number of initiatives to increase direct awareness of the school environment are of particular importance for young people who are nourishing the working world.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to distract it from its social seriousness. A legislative standard must be put into effect and improved.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "as the phenomenon of labour-related deaths presents an urgent social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on determined rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight improvement, but this does not exclude the fact that the number of accidents at work is far too high," said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How to believe that you are basically doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to inform workers who are already starting at school."
"Another effort is necessary - as he adds - in terms of communication and raising public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency is called for".
Mercandelli also insisted on "the progressive deterioration of protection for the victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "abolition of the social system which we have been fighting against in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or random donations decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 Player under charge: Risk of hearing damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable musical instruments, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which quoted the opinion of the EU's Csrseri (scientific committee on current and recently identified health risks) in a report published today in Brussels.
"The report – as it says in a note – makes it clear that 5-10 % of those listening to music with portable musical instruments for at least five years per week for more than an hour a day, risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually place portable music and mobile phones on a high volume, will damage their hearing without knowing it irreversibly," said Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – as the EU says – there is a clear risk that action is too rapid.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and to make this information a common good.
In the light of these scientific findings, we need to review the control systems already in place to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology".
Brussels commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
"The scientists - this is the conclusion of the EU Communication - confirm that there is a real concern and that the European Commission will now, together with the other EU members and the stakeholders, examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable musical instruments and similar devices".
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable musical instruments to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could come from excessive noise pollution.
One can limit these damage very much, in which one takes to solutions such as reducing the volume and length of noise exposure.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if users of portable musical instruments only listen to loud (more than 89 decibels) music a week, so that the legal limits which apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace have already been exceeded.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This represents 5 to 10% of users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, March is supposed to be over, June is being taken stock.
This is the process laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". The Commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will prepare the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the capital and the mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural views are represented in it," - stresses Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain in charge of the City Council and the Municipal Council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, their task will end and the Commission will be dissolved again, as such a project must have a fixed end point.
In June - as the Mayor proclaims - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
Those who question the competence of the Commission, because of a lack of commitment to it, reply Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers high-quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then their contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
On the other hand, we want to have a longer period in mind, so that in a deeper perspective we can work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city".
The Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, it will cost the Roman citizens no cent and it will bring us to think. It will employ the best heads of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step in the future".
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which "will look much further not only at the current municipal borders, but also at the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician, who has a lot to do with being considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the economy of the United States and maintained relations with the enemy Islam (and is still doing so as a private man today).
The attacks on Obama are becoming more and more violent, right now, when the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!".
In fact, however, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the voter's question: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with great advantage.
Also in this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in its editorial: only in the election cabin will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice to.
Here is a US mentality that has been kept hidden up to the last.
"Tell me what you want, then we'll decide who we're gonna make, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: If Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now, where the success of the black candidate seems so sure.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What mistake did Bush make during his term of office? 89% replied: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains the weak point for the majority of Bush.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "murder" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really explain to those who are concerned about the general credibility of the information concerning responsibilities.
They don't feel as alone as they used to.
The problem for the American journalists is the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems arising from the cuts to the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper, are the main problems.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – as the journalists interviewed said – if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism today fulfills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism is on the wrong path at national level.
In the local area, executives even account for 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the web goes.
The main publishing groups are moving the way into the Internet, which many see as the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has risen by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted wanting to join the new technology in the hope of "bringing something good for journalism".
The biggest crack in American journalism today is between the chief editors of newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors at national level are certain that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level they are only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work".
Managers who are afraid to lose their jobs within three years will be 47% at national level.
It's 30% among journalists.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our editors, Anm. d. Red.) is always a current topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers offer it as it is popular with them and so it will be a question of taking it or leave it.
The chief editors get very often very high wages, but the editor can sometimes get only 10,000 euros per month, along with pension and insurance money.
As for the holiday, the matter becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they themselves admit, are often "sick" over the course of the year.
It's a question of the climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BELIEVES IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Chamber of the Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the application of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for Bankrot in the context of the counter-arrangement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was transformed into a residence order in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such relocations (which the prosecutor had pronounced) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain evidence against him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the 700 billion dollar savings package of the White House: a large part of the Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday's issue of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis in progress is spreading the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast souls, who always favored the state institutions and the business community, and those neo-conservative who are hostile to "those in Washington" and the financial world, and who are, above all, winning voters in the south and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its ascent to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned is, however, only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, also in the entire West and perhaps beyond these will be affected by them.
In both the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-awaited events which are finally taking shape under these new conditions and which come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard-of renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close links with foreign countries, and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the assets of households living in a single state.
This is a direct political problem for governments: how to behave towards the families concerned, which are indeed a huge mass of voters.
The crisis thus appears to be global in economic terms, and politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have gone out of the way and lost its right to speak: the EU has given the clear proof of this, which, because of its division into different national and international conflicts, cannot find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more serious, only the United States is in the economic situation to save itself without any foreign aid.
In addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two conditions – under certain circumstances – that are not to be over-emphasized, in which otherwise no international organization and no market will be able to take advantage of in a similar way.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed on the national-state element is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that has recently been attached to a closely related sector in the economy: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now that we have been so convinced that we have long since entered a networked global empire, a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of immaterial, that we must at once determine how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
While these can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are still connected to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, one who has such a territory, compared to another who lives in an unharvested, waterless or oil-free territory, is in favor.
I now come to the second novelty, which requires a brief boost.
Anyone who says territory, government, politics also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge about the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to deal with things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of deterrence over the existing guides, especially those of the economy, which have emerged as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a certain sense, still worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, inadvertentness, an image of inadequacies, a sense of distance, which is all directed towards a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems to be the conviction among large sections of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose status the majority represents as always more alien and permissive.
The demand for leadership thus feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of the demise of the leading class and of the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the unwarranted reversal of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in the UK, towards the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, have more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value regarding what is happening today in the lower social strata of the West and is further reinforced by the financial crisis and driven up to overdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super sticker that goes up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a adhesive and to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached its goal.
With a glue applied on an area of only 2.5 square meters, the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of a stack of spaghetti tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the Geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the reptiles and at the same time "lets them remove from the wall without any problems", according to Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at Dayton University.
TO MAUERN DELANGDER? "This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps already, but the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall into the space field.
So for the moment, the superheroes have to wait.
The other type of research – also the University of Berkeley, California – is dedicated to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present a microfibre adhesive that cleans itself from dust like hair through movement on a surface and thus always preserve a perfect liability.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Be careful of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, especially in summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario, London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaged as well as fresh fruit juices in connection with drug intake. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he again issued an alarm: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to the extent that they are virtually eliminated and thus endangers the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular medications, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS – The same Agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture in a report two years ago, and stressed that attention should be paid to what is drunk in combination with medicines such as diazepan or methadone.
IT IS NOT GRAPH FRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Therefore the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers who are free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to read the package leaflet at all times and, if there are still uncertainties, not to have the courage to ask a pharmacist or a doctor," the expert of the Assa Agency emphasizes.
Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the day of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction that received little polemics as an answer and was still kept to the economist years later, but today turns out to be entirely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of Enron's or Worldcom's collapses has disappeared from the public eye", Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a banalizer with a "very aggressive style, particularly against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the Anti-Microsoft package
The day of release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, Open Source Software gains an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both under self-employed and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteers, supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself to the public with some innovations: in addition to a revised and now more sparsely designed initial menu, now is finally a reason to ensure compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against which was also the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, the new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes sending via email easier. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics editing modules while maintaining the original appearance of the page.
This allows you to generate "hybrid" PDF files that expand the typical graphics of Adobe format around the elements of a table and a text processing system.
The collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by different users, avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor is assigned a booklet to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently publishing various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result will be made public.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. This means that it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Besides for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, if the freedom of costs could be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme to private households, it is also particularly in the area of business, where OpenOffice could succeed: after all, various institutions of public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus opening up even business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program, which aims at a displacement of Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as with PowerPoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of the more well-known access; and finally Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be slightly exceeded for already 3 million and 600 thousand.
Kohl also tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new doping case within the framework of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third-class and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who was tested positively on Cera, the third-generation epoch. Previously, this was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The blood tests from Kohl's blood samples belong to those conducted in the last few weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the opposite tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
According to the Associated Press, the head of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest, and also notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEMA APPLICATION: THE NEW YORK TIME FRAMEWORK: IS ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of emigration has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only accepted with resistance.
Does this make Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article, devoted entirely to the subject of racism in Italy and based on the case of young, Burkina Faso-like Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after he stole a pack of biscuits.
The case is evidence of what the Times call "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where "most integration and work opportunities exist" and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega Nord are recorded".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the Lega and to speed up the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement which also stresses the Pope and the President: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euro per room high rental prices
The housing market for students does not know any crises.
According to the last study of the Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious features. Whole groups of students thus lose their right to study in fact, since their families are not able to support them at this level" – according to Sunia's executive, Laura Mariani – "in these cities, the great demand by the students leads to a distortion of the market that has damaged the other inhabitants as well.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized sub-rents.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which result in a revision of taxation at lower rental prices.
Looking at the study more closely, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping space is needed in the Brianza district of about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiat, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a sleeping area costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, are 250/280 euros for a sleeping place of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who avoid outside can save money: 300 Euro for a sleeping place and 450 Euro for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room is the price between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive districts, the Policlinico, Vandero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 Euro, one single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they are more important in the urban economy.
In the cities where the rental phenomenon of non-European students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: rents above the average of 25-30% are demanded by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of excluding cinemas, which began with the birth of the great multi-salt complexes in the periphery, means in the long term death for the uni-salt cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the features of a cultural crime.
These are mostly historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom one has covered a piece of street full of emotions", says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It's the story of a suburbs cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these ticks paid for the most part the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main perpetrators are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years Lombardy leads the lists, 81 it is in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "although it is useful that new structures also arise, but first and foremost is the preservation of the already existing one, because closes a hall in the city, not all its regular customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here the missing state for the fund of the trade association remains outside eight: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be needed in the year".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, because of the fears of the old cinemas, has decided to protect them by an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
Tax concessions for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in terms of local transport are also included under the above measures: driving into the traffic-limited areas of the centre and parking more cheap parking fees.
"It's a happy initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
Certainly, however, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to align against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because in the end, the audience is more demanding today.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to establish the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had played with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side not to have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and Ndrantheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group piro model.
The accusations made by the Bar Association of Anti-Mafia authorities against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalle, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, was also handcuffed: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a compensation sum of 10 million euros for involvement in criminal gangs of the mafia.
"Deceptive of every kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromodelle money for consulting activities."
"This made it possible for the mafia group – according to the judges – to enter the town halls on an official basis and to influence public administration policy."
The president of the Calabrian Regional Committee, Agazio Loiro, does not deny that in his region, "it is anything but an exception to encounter connections between local authorities and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such links are virtually unavoidable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrantheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which the police of the Clan Piromodelle said they were decapitated.
Since the end of last April, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved, but already 1991 – and also at that time because of alleged links between organized crime and local administration – the local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Middle Right Coalition after the election of May 2006.
He shouted scandal as the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in it in the Deputy Minister of State Marco Minniti, whom he accused of inventing everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges explain in connection with this morning's arrest warrant that the Piromodelel clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From a listening action in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the piro model – thus making the public administration’s actions identical to the interests of this clan.”
When the energy emerges from the waves, suddenly the Great Ones rise.
It is a non-diverse source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and only now does this seem to understand the world's great energy companies.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that are now all looking at, and also seeking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; not by chance these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
As the price of oil fell by 1980, the idea of marine energy is being ignored, but environmental organizations and the increase in the price of oil are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy needs could be met by the energies generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to the doubling of the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
The currents and tides would also be added.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to focus on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract in 2005 to set up a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies in the traditional energy sector that rely on marine energy production.
"Chevron is investigating these technologies" – the spokesman of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal – and is considering the possibility of working with us."
It is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is not to be underestimated, especially considering that oil is still being promoted by the United States in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers are talking about an increasing interest.
Still improved technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still emerging, not least since the last doubts from environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small size and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with much greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are different possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of connected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is transformed into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater pipelines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind which are only awaiting state approval. Part of the energy generated could also be used for military installations.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a parking space using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement during the tides drives the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of possible clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Production Research, a particular interest deserves the potential that exists in times.
Although this is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
In particular, tidal energy is what has led federal states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to invest already 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million in 2009 are already planned.
