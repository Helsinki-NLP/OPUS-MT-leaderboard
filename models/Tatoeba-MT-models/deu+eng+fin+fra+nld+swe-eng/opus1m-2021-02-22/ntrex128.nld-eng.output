Members of the National Assembly of Wales concerned that they “will be compared with Muppets”
There is a shock among the Members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name ‘Well Assembly’ to ‘Well Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name will be ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party’s National Assembly of Wales said that MWP is ‘rawing on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: Twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the Plaid Party National Assembly of Wales said that the group as a whole is ‘unsatisfied’ and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party 'is open' to the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context the Welshe letter W is pronounced as a short you.
The Commission of the Wales National Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: 'It is of course the Members of the Wales National Assembly themselves who take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At the moment, the Members of the National Assembly would be proposing alternatives, but President Jones will find it difficult to reach a consensus, and she will have to present a bill on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The reform legislation also includes other amendments to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when they debate legislation.
Citizens of Macedonia vote in a referendum on changing their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote if they wish to change the name of their country to ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a pending dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has already objected repeatedly to Macedonia's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the change of name, said that he would not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem have it difficult
'The older people I spoke with said that there was a café and a church here earlier on every corner,' said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to be seen."
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
"People now have social contact in a different way," he said.
"Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people go regularly."
However, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of the church assets will be less long if the leaders expect, ‘and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning.’
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of the people who buy apartments in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to these churches being closed even more quickly, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these apartments will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church municipality nearby took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by Honor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Eervalt Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a carillon.
Father David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon 'the bells of the poor'.
The expert who played the carillon in July referred in another way to the instrument: 'a cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first caraard in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger caraard of the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the bishop.
The Congregation (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would ‘contribute the costs’ to the Congregation, although it had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors who had sent it.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Hay hurts 13-year-olds who fell for lobsters in California
Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who died of lobsters in California. The boy suffered injuries, so it sounds.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that on Saturday he had been sleeping with friends about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help. Together with a few others, he pedaled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that the boy cried out because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized “that the boy cried out: “I’m bitten!
I am bitten!"
His keybone was completely open," saw Hammel as he approached the boy.
"I screamed that everyone should go out of the water: "There is a shark in the water!"
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in danger of life.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Beach Guard Captain Larry Giles told in a press conference that a few weeks before a shark was shot in the area, but that it was then concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured to the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams and direct beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in department stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth and continues to grow at £2.8 billion, while the sales of fashion and household goods continue to decline, and the larger beauty departments are being tested at 11 shops across the country, and if they prove successful, they will be introduced into more shops next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also due to the fact that supermarkets want to fill with other products where TVs, microwaves and interior products were once on display.
Sainsbury's wants to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also has more space, with extra space per brand, as in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also bringing its Boutique make-up back to the market, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something that makes younger shoppers increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery will test the Fragrance Shop concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first one is opened in Croydon, south London, the second one is opened later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Because more and more people shop online and more often buy small quantities of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to do more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive Officer of Sainsbury's, says that stores will look more and more like department stores, now that the supermarket chain is recording it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased as a result and the acquisitions have generated more efficiency.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its department beauty and pharmacy a make-over, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's partnership with Boots was tested at the beginning of the 2000s, but the partnership was terminated when a conflict arose over the distribution of revenues from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments in the stores three years ago for an amount of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have completely changed the design of our beauty department so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'wrong' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from 11 million pound deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'worry' because TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand of homewear and accessories.
Jones and Willoughby are compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's 37-year-old presenter announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is raging at Holly Willoughby, because she has withdrawn at the last moment from their profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘worrying’ when, at a difficult meeting in the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, Willoughby announced that due to her new contracts (with a value of £1 and £1 and £1 million) she did not have enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company is compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune from an estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future, and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was upset when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The warehouse of the main establishment in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of the most profitable stars of Britain, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now lead to further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 together with Capp, and Jones, 52, was president of the company in March.
The two booths often go together on holiday and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become brand ambassador of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the British channel ITV.
A source from Jones's entourage said last night, "We have no comment on his business affairs."
Hard language 'and then it was love between us'
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media about a remark he made that some people would find ‘inappropriate for a president’, and about his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
"I didn't give up anything."
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been ongoing.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea’s top diploma Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see any ‘consistent reaction’ by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States is continuing its sanctions to keep the pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We're doing very well in North Korea," he said.
“We stood close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have resulted in positive results. The rocket tests have ended, hostages have been released and the material surpluses of American soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, it would be about 200 people,” Trump said, pointing out to the audience before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island with hundreds of deaths
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer had a home, there was no national disaster announced, which is a prerequisite for the start of international aid.
'In many cases, it is obvious that they are not applying for international aid, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain whether the helpers from abroad can work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, it is still very poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to shelter at tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
The fact that no warning syrup for tsunamis was present in Palu, even if there was a warning in force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Also in ideal circumstances it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship at Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's homeless infrastructure was one of the cornerstones of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government has a lack of funding, and that is when he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the streets, with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes an impressive equator against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge guarded Liverpool last Saturday for loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in 89th minute, during a match in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from the target of Chelsea, when his team was 1-0 behind.
He ticked left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the far pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty range, in the direction of the upper right corner of the net.
He got rid of Kepa Arrizabalaga's jump and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,” Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Edge approaching and ventured an attempt. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked on the ball.’
Chelsea stood at rest with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The tip of The Blues kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the middle field to Liverpool's playhelf.
Kovacic did a quick one-two in the middle field.
After that, he gave a nice stick pass, which enabled Hazard to reach the crime scene.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alison Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool will be playing against Napoli at 3 p.m. on Wednesday in the group stage of the Champions League, in the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes it up in London at 3 p.m. against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to 832, said the National Disaster Relief Agency on Sunday morning.
Many people were stuck in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 from last Friday, where waves were also 6 m high, said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after wife's death
This morning, the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 p.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street.
The police are asking the locals to report when they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation has only just started, but I want everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they have possibly filmed something via a Dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends came to think that they know the woman on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that it will be hours before they can return home.
A police officer would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She just keeps repeating, 'What a shame!'.
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the deposit and a third were just outside.
Within the deposit, a number of agents watched the apartment building.
If you have any information, please send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, with log 247 of 30 September.
The status of Cromwell in the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'-rel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as 'dwarf' and 'an attempt to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on removing statues would lead to the fishing of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoplasm of the British Civil Wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that existed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that, according to many, still needs recognition.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a perfectly correct idea is still the subject of debate.
What is certain is that in the middle of the 17th century the conflict has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered.'
Murderous pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in the southwest of China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, known only as 'Yuan', was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province. His artery was pierced and he was blooddated, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the feeding of pigs at a pig stable, on 30 May 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and turned out to be a door to a nearby pig house.
According to the nephew, a large male pig with blood was found on his mouth in the pig's throat.
A forensic investigation showed that the 250 kg pig killed the farmer, according to the report.
‘My cousin’s legs were bleeding and maimed,’ the nephew said with the last name ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On footage of surveillance cameras, it can be seen that Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal the man killed wasn't from Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
It is said that the Yuan family and the market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for his death.
It happens rarely, but there have been cases of pigs that attack people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, which seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife took the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba testified at CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can induce aggression.
“They’re just playing.
They're like kids, they're very curious, they're not interested in hurting people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of the hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the USA
As predicted, hurricane Rosa is weakening now that she has reached the cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
At a wind speed of 135 km/h Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 hours local time on Sunday morning and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to ascend north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trog begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, moving eastwards towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northwards, towards the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 centimetres of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trog will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, rain currents and possibly landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised not to enter the desert on foot when the tropical rain threatens.
The heavy rainfall can overthrow ravines in deserted rivers, and storms will cause local windflakes and dust.
The approaching trog brings local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rain of 1.5 cm is possible, which could lead to small waste streams and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
Spreading tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rain will spread more on Monday end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can strongly vary, because the Arctic is getting cooler, but the tropics remain rather hot.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a nice example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the middle and east of the US, October would be expected to start warm, with all temperatures floating around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the north-east.
In New York it can be 27 degrees Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chance is high until mid-October at above average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched one of the six television networks on the offensive testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an alleged assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, while broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday's surprise: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Justice that she is 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh beat her and tried to take her clothes off during a party at high school.
Kavanaugh stated in an incarcerated testimony that he was 100% certain that this had not happened.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have watched on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data were not immediately available for the other networks that sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look in an office.
For comparison: that's about as for a play-off of a football match or for the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, which fully supports Kavanaugh's appointment, had most viewers during the hearing day: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the audience remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, CNN's and CBS' cameras registered on Friday morning that protesters shouted at him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing of the Commission for Justice.
He kept standing a few minutes with his eyes knocked down while being bullied, live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he is telling the people the truth?
Someone called out, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various channels broadcast everything live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of that understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominated by next week, something the Democrats of the minority are urging.
Among other things, Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the examination.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians of criticising her plans to leave the European Union from a “political game” with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives for the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit. He said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's taxes was 'absurd'.
Shooter Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for shooting Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of murder, said Baton Rouge police.
The authorities posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police questioned Simpson and later stated that he had confessed that he shot Wayde with death.
His deposit is set at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
On Friday, the body of the congregation in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a shot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local residents all contributed to the investigation leading to an arrest.
Sport director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his ‘commitment and striving for justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per race last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team’s ‘chapot’ and ‘in shock’ was killed by Waydes.
“This is an event that you always hope will never happen,” says Wade.
Vulkan spits ashes on Mexico City
The ashes thrown out by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Ramp Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity was picked up in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a period of 24 hours.
The center detected several times drumming and vibrations.
On social media photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on car windows in neighbourhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital. That is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 on the Richter scale hit central Mexico.
The volcano, called 'Don Goyo', has been active since 1994.
Police crash with Catalan Separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists failed with the riot police, while thousands of participants participated in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Catalonia vote on independence that broke down the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by the rebel police shot the agents with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, the police broke out of a tuxedo, and the cops pulled their bats up to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Do not forget, do not forgive’, while their opponents called ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for slight injuries during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions continue to increase in the independent region, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters overwhelmingly spoke out to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who are against separation boycotted the mood.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region, where it came to violent skirmishes.
Pro-independence groups had campaigned on the night of Friday on Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who accompanied his wife in the Separatist protest, said that he was no longer hopeful of Catalonia’s prospects for independence.
‘Last year we’ve had one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was nifty, it was difficult for them this year to build on their success because many of their most well-known leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in captivity, pending a trial on their role in organising the referendum and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mounter who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been raised by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are increasing," he said.
On Saturday Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in provisional detention since the end of last year, declared that he will be taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"A candidate for the European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after house was built with a car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years old were arrested after a car was repeatedly built in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent around 7.30 p.m. on Thursday.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building themselves had been damaged.
A crossbow on the car may have been fired at some point.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga’s goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston provided them with the victory
The graduate Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to the same level as Hibernian.
Gerrards team did not succeed this season to win a competition during the Premiership. They have to take the Sunday against leader Hearts, who is ahead of them eight points.
But first the Rangers Rapid Vienna receive Thursday in the Europa League.
The team won six consecutive matches in his department, and coach Holt has not suffered any defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
Holt's team could have made a head start long before the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all sorts of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a target. Then Alan Lithgow, who recorded Craig Halkett's cupball, kicked the ball over the target.
The home team had the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances calmly and confidently.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free step and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who was from the crime scene.
At that time, the Rangers had held a ball for a long time, but the defense of the home team was unmistakable and target man Liam Kelly had not had much to do yet.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball against the feet of Rangers target Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a advance from his colleagues in Livingston.
Livingston's crime scene continued to be promoted, but they were rejected each time. Two times a criminal shooting was refused, one after Halkett's attack on invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellently without exception and continued to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team have hardly changed since their return to the highest region, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way in which he has lifted the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not know how to break through.
Even though they have played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final stage was not good enough (they only succeeded once to slow down the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better. After all, they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together on Saturday (29 September) breakfasts in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left for Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 from gathering for the mosque, but many sympathizers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also made their voice heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after impact by car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10.15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in an escape crime accident on Children Street, about one and a half miles from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were in the process of identifying the man and his immediate family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are redirected and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six prisoners injured in disorder
Six prisoners were injured in a disorder of order in a severely secure prison for men, according to the prison office.
On Sunday, at around 9.30 a.m. local time, the ills broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still underway.
Specialised ‘Tornado’ prisoners are deployed to resolve the situation, involving eight prisoners in one department.
The ciphers were treated there for slight injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: ‘A specially trained prison staff has been deployed for an actual incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind longer.'
In HMP Long Lartin, over 500 prisoners remain, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had been treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the riot police were called to prison for a serious disorder in which personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (possibly having a positive impact on drought areas)
It is rare that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. That is because the remaining energy of hurricane Rosa moves over the southwest of the desert, bringing risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already given warnings for sudden floods for the west from Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City for Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday. Monday evening it will rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.'
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas not at risk of flooding, Rosa's rain may be a blessing, because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently undergoing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current dry areas are identified, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona is making at least extreme dryness, which in a second highest category," reported weather.com.
The course of hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still in hurricane power on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, which makes it feel weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm.
Heavy rain may fall in parts of Mexico, with a significant flood risk.
‘A total drop of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa moves north across Mexico like a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours as a tropical depression, which will then be set off by Arizona and in the south of Utah on Tuesday evening.
“The greatest danger expected of Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert area,” said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and waste streams in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured at about 4 hours local time on Saturday in the district of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is ‘stable’.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something that happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'has suffered under the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment process Kavanaugh 'has suffered under the commonwealth, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, denying forcefully and emotionally Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when she was teenagers.
During the hearing Ford also testified about her allegations.
The President said on Saturday that the ‘American people’ saw the beautiful and incredible character, the quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognises one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record,” he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
“Over five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives takes place.
I'm not taking part, but actually I'm taking part," he said.
'That's why I come up everywhere for great candidates.'
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to 'offer resistance and hinder us'.
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, told a top employee of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is increasing
In a major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many of which were wiped off when huge waves fell on the beach, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of about six metres high hit land at the time it began to foam. Many people fell to plow and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became the victim of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disasters BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he hit everything on the land," said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had travelled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed into a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
In aerial photographs released by the natural disaster relief office, it can be seen that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges crossed and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to quake by aftershocks.
The earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during the massive earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long narrow bay, has yet to enlarge the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “sightly” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some fatal victims were trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said. About 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage can be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala ‘is completely flat, we have no information at all’, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living,” said the Red Cross in a statement. “The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse,” the Red Cross said.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday because it had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time that the warning had been given.
In amateur images shared on social media, you can hear a man shouting at the top floor of a building panicking at people on the street down to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
minutes later a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged away.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, said the authorities, but the evacués are still in urgent need of food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened for assistance only and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Dodentol of tsunami rises above 800.
It's very bad.
While Dongglala’s World Vision employees have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees in the courtyard of their office are looking for shelter in tents of deck, but passing on the way through scenes of destruction, said Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that had been destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the difficult task of initiating emergency aid began, some people complained that certain foreign aid providers with a high level of expertise could not travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian legislation, financing, goods and personnel from abroad can only be authorised if the location of a disaster is designated as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.’
When the second night after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing persons continued to hope that they would find their loved ones' lives, as in the miracles that people love to hear in terrible natural disasters like this.
Saturday, a boy was taken from a sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers released a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread to the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one grey tip instead of two blue tips appeared.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thiefs steal $26,750 while supplying ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver had just emptyed a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, so Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was working, another man walked behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspected flights, according to the press release, but the police did not say how many persons were involved in the incident.
If you have any information on the identity of the perpetrators, please contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter, saying: ‘The being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his show on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandex.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the show's creator.
Yes is not only an abbreviation of his current artist name. Previously, West told us that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’, said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album at radio presenter Big Boy.
‘So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
I have moved from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously worked with West, has also worked with and without the link sign and capital letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians, the country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would ‘never use military force to suppress the Mexican people.’
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, during which time left student movements occurred throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
United States needs to double funding for A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on research by A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be the number one in A.I. innovations by 2030.
“The budget for research into A.I. would already be a good start, given the fact that all the other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.,” said Lee.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the chances of the next major achievement for A.I. in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book 'AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order' this month was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sanovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated the best American Othello player, and later he was a manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next race would take place, because it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the US, researchers often need to work hard to obtain public subsidies, said Lee.
“China is not taking our best academics, the companies are doing that,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the best forces from universities to work on A.I.
Lee said that American efforts in the A.I. area would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
"Whoever does a PhD in A.I. should be offered a green card automatically," he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its next generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve industry and academic partners in the initiative, and announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF currently invests more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the US legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has been in the loop for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of the name of their country to ‘North Macedonia’, which would resolve a dispute with Greece that has been taking place for decades and would no longer impede Macedonia’s application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that its northern neighbour's name means that the country claims Greek territory, and thus Greece vetoed Macedonia's inclusion in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change in name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he was not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign was not sure that the required rise of at least 50% would be achieved, so that the referendum might not be valid.
The question on the ballot paper was worded as follows: 'Do you support NATO and the EU's membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?'
‘Proponents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia broke up.
“I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient Members of Parliament have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-way street in Parliament.
The National Election Commission said that there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the rise was only 16% at the time, compared with 34% during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would open the way for NATO and European Union membership.
For the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and put up chairs for tents that were placed by people who boycotted the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a back gate,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will provide a necessary investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
Another survey, conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of them would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the rise must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it came into power last May.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and Scoort
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short measurements with the defense of Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the match with 2-0.
It looked like a whistle of one cent, as Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian Spits first got the ball played on the middle field.
He raced between three Brighton defensemen, straight into the open field.
There, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew how to pass a defenseman and was also too fast for some others at the edge of Brighton's crime scene.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English attacker used his first action in the crime scene to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat target Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling that gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was standing deep in the field of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful step pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball with him and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player hit the ball just before he was too far away.
City takes place on Tuesday at 12.55 a.m. against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The race takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play along and it doesn't make the Rockies easy to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals were eliminated for the play-off, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Nevertheless, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences for the Rockies’ participation in the play-off. They are currently in one match at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least one wild card for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to do everything they can to ensure their first division title.
“Although there is nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play along in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sundays, but are reportedly inclined to make Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, stood in the throw field Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normal his rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher stands at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
‘All we have achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks' time, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections, and I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part, and that's why I'm here for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: “We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take back power, no matter what they're supposed to do for it.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to gain power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to 'offer resistance and hinder us'.
“And we’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats ‘boos and mean and false and false.’
He named the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to a loud appeal from the public.
“You know what she answered?
Did you read the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant for people who say what they think
When Momentum activists voted in my local party to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I'm the latest in a whole series of Labour talks that got us not to be welcome, just because we're saying what we're thinking.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was given similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough like those issues where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And that was also the case during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I am already a local Labour speaking member.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and has long forgotten the promise of a ‘ milder, softer’ policy if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues who, to the extent I knew, had a similar political view as I, suddenly expected me to turn around and take a position that I would never have agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak for a public, whatever I say, there are riot parties on social media calling for my candidacy to be rejected for the next elections, denouncing the centre's policy and saying that I should not be a Labour member.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments made to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are dealing with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is that there appear to be some sort of normal joke.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motion of distrust’ or change of selection rules, the party becomes more petty.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to keep quiet, not just to express my opinion loudly, and then I would 'don't get in trouble'.
But I didn't go to politics for that.
Since I became a student of Labour 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a councillor and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, nor at the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my dispute with the current leadership.
To those who have advocated the motion Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves on to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact I have only one message, and it is not directed at Nottingham Momentum, but at my constituents, whether they are a Labour member or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidature as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unsaved Ayr on his way to the top
Two late try's may have pulled the final result slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr is right to triumph in this delicious day's competition in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the ranking, the only unselected team of the ten.
Eventually it was both their superior defense and their better chances that the home team provided the victory, and coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied.
“We’ve had a hard time at our matches so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they have taken advantage of their opportunities better than we have.’
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, finished by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card by Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors' game) Melrose could have the numbers spoken and Jason Baggot managed to break a try.
Climo took care of a penalty for an extra advantage for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solo just before the rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was a long-time stopover for a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken off on a bar, and as soon as the match was restarted, Ayr could continue to run through a try by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then Commander Blair Macpherson of Ayr got a yellow card, and Melrose recalculated with the extra man when no conversion followed a Bruce Colvine try at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he had Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of a touch-down behind the rising Ayr mouth at the penalty-line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe took up the box kick by David Armstrong and sent half-back Gregor Henry away for the fifth try of the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going to the restaurant. Apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan's life after Craiglang is already being planned.
According to official information, he is the director of Afahrtmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it seem that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the 'flowering restaurant business' in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the country-closed Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Seafarers patrol in a certified marine office in La Paz.
In public buildings, an ocean blue flag waves.
On all the marine bases from the Titicaca Lake to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
Throughout the country, Bolivia is still alive, as is the desire to repatriate the Pacific after a bloody 19th-century conflict of raw materials to Chile.
This hope has perhaps reached its highest point in the last decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should be discussed on 1 October after five years.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, looks forward to the result with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the Court of Justice's ruling on big screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will argue in favour of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of lively talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who next year is in favour of a controversial fight for re-election, is much at stake with the verdict of Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia, and even if it did, there would be little change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the territory of Chile and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of any discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling falls only six months after the closing remarks indicates that the case was ‘uncomplicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome for Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation has perhaps deteriorated even over the last four years.
“The case around access to the sea has been capped by the current Bolivian government,” said Zárate.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has all the good will that Chile might have completely undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to continue the discussion below.
The two countries have not been ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will ‘be given an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of international relations with Chile’ and an opportunity to ‘end 139 years of disagreement, with mutual benefits’, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, is using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up his right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
‘The statement is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons unless Washington can trust it.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made at a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the established nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore Summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says that it is a 'utopia' that the permanent sanctions and American opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would refrain from an arsenal that probably sees the country as his only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head covers, soon for sale near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your sight, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were not to think away from Instagram this summer and these designers sent their blinding creations on the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a springy wide edge, hanging over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons occupied with gemstones, a magician's hat and even an pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colourful masks, the lips were closed. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than they looked like haute couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're lucky.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The gigantic hats may be inspired by 'La Bomba', the striped hat with a two meter wide edge that carries everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also made for another great creation on the catwalk: a sprinkled beach bag that was almost as big as the model in bathing suit that the bag was sailing with.
The red-orange raffia bag, set with raffia fries and finished with a white leather handle, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the shops in the coming summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent position of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other initiatives of the whole community.
With more than 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desired subjects in excellent schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can not only trust in English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can derive that languages are top of the ranking, with the highest drop rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of the students studying foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data collected from 74 schools associated with SCIS show that 72 per cent of students achieved a high score ('A') in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of students in German, 69 per cent of students in French and 63 per cent of students in Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as specialist choice as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
According to employers, a survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the traffic jams to fill vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are thus becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future career.
Now that more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage on competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language out of the 10%, with a total of 15%.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Several languages can speak, especially those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important for the United Kingdom when they are looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specialised in this field.
Scottish independent schools are working to provide a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied at the moment that languages in a global business environment remain vital for the future of the country, so this needs to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for the first LeBron James match at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening competition before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
There's still a number of minutes to be worked out.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week James was asked about his plans for the Lakers schedule for the six races prior to the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need games before the season to prepare myself,” he said.
Trump election rally period in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallyes
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallys in the coming week, including stops in places that he's been given, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he is choosing for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been pending, Trump wants to build up support for the forthcoming mid-term elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voted in November.
What time does the Trump rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably be talking about the hearings for candidate judge Brett Kavanaugh of this week. These were extra loaded now that Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may be waiting a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI is investigating the matter.
But the main purpose of this series of rallyes is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more energy.
President Trump's campaign leader said that these five rallys next week are intended to 'encourage volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives', Reuters says.
‘Control over Congress is so important to its program, that the president travels to as many states as possible now that the busy campaign season begins,’ said a spokesman of the Trump campaign who did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
The rally tonight in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep hope alive in the run-up to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon were perhaps just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging loop of opportunities is a fully invented sports concept, but a true player really believes in it, and especially in competitions like this.
So who's getting the best chances right now?
‘They had a lead of six points at first, and now that is only four more, so we find so little that the happiness is at present on our side,’ said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of being in favour of four points, while twelve are still at stake.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and have scored three points each of the four.
Spieth has been a fearsome opponent from tea to green and he sets the good example.
The typical throat sounds that he makes when he plays well became louder as his round advanced and he achieved a crucial putt with which he achieved four success when he and Thomas stood behind two points after two matches.
His putt with which she won the match at 15 wins was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can derive that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and just worry about your own game,” said Spieth.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but delicious European duo has four in four and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only duo that didn’t play bugey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bugeys.
As a result of that series, and the way in which they seem to exchange energy with their rumoured audience, they are the players who have to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever who will make a European victory when the sun sets above Le Golf National.
Preferably both in different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backwardness for the Spanish and the Swedish that they no longer came above.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get behind.
The four-balls and four-somes are so fascinating to see because of the interaction between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way in which a strategy can change in a glance.
The European team has so far played its best and has a good lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to start the fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubt.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and four-somes of Saturday, they stand on the United States with 10-6.
The in-country duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had a hard time, making them four points ahead in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who liked to return the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the blinding Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but couldn't catch up.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points during the 12 singles matches of Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who wins four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who got the nickname ‘Molliwood’, after a sensational weekend, are just the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening matches.
After they had made Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they were beautifully played on each other and devoured a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally showed a great move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and four-somes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the morning's four-balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Nevertheless, on this pleasant day, it did not run from a lion's throw for Europe with a breeze south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with three points on Saturday.
They won after a tough match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later lost Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up with four points at the beginning of the singles, although Furyk's team has enough equal play since they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But since they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says that it will 'in no case' disarm one-sided without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the ongoing sanctions are leading to increasing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would in no case be able to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken ‘important goodwill measures’ over the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the location for nuclear tests and the promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see a similar reaction from the US," he said.
‘Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way unarm ourselves.’
Although Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a ‘phased’ approach to denucleation, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it took further steps, it became apparent that he did not a priori reject unilateral denucleation, as Pyongyang did before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June when Kim promised to work towards the ‘declearisation of the Korean Peninsula’, while Trump promised guarantees for the safety of North Korea.
North Korea is aiming for a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted calls to ease the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. calls for 'denularisation first' and increases pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the 'explanation of the end of war'," said Ri.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our distrust.'
Ri did not report plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the American leader at the United Nations did earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party to this issue of denuclearisation was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.’
However, the tone of Ri's speech was considerably different from last year, when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the American mainland be targeted so after Mr. Evil President Trump Kim called a 'racketman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, promised Kim this year to the United Nations his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much has to be done and that sanctions must continue until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.’
China and Russia consider that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: ‘The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must be continued forcefully and certainly until we have achieved the complete, final, verified denularisation.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has conducted unanimous sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting outside the UN General Assembly with Ri and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Just a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea told him to put forth 'gander-like demands'.
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take “consistent measures”.
He said that Kim had told him that the ‘conformity measures’ he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will make sure that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study through the night and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor found that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. As far as he knows, this is unique in the USA.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a speech on the influence of sleep failure on learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me saying, 'Why do I get to hear this in my last year?'
She said that no one ever told her how important sleep is, what surprised me', he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which is organised for the first time this year, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help to improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was determined that students had a severe sleep deficiency during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see an image of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep failure, and the importance of a routine sleeping experience.
In another section, participants will learn how long-term sleep failure increases the risk of a heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a map of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what the consequences of the choice of cigarettes will have on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of pride at night still exists, he says, and because of modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep shortages are an ever greater problem.
Care for adequate sleep, of good quality, must be the student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep loss makes the brain give them a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course. Last year he had been teaching at the professor when he studied at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make sure that the course was available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for their bedtime, and not only an alarm to stand up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light of electronics screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal makes Gerrard's men go down
The Rangers saw their competition again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team hit 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during a competition since they lost St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team took care of the defeat, barely Gerrard's second as manager in 18 games. His team now stands behind eight points on Hearts, which go further to the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored at seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equator.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more trouble, as the border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown at him by the visitor team supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team. They stopped Ayr and went to the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same eleven for Livingston, who knew how to cut off a point last week. He would have been excited about how his well-trained team managed to block the opponents at every move.
The Rangers might have had the most ball possessions, but Livingston did more.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga released the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in sight, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free stairs from Keaghan Jacobs reached Commander Craig Halkett, but his fellow defenseman Alan Lithgow kicked against the rear pole.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to be hoping for a good outcome rather than actually believing in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos in any case found himself entitled to a criminal charge when he and Steven Lawless fought after a quarter of a century, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who used to be the target at the Ibrox, easily stopped the Lassana Coulibaly cup and the trunk shot of Oviedo Ejaria.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may or may not be in the continuation of the general course of play, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was just their hard work.
Again, the Rangers weren't up against Jacobs' deep playing pattern.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball on to Scott Robinson, who remained cool bloody and chose Menga, who easily hit the ball.
Gerrard made a break with the change Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced off his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston kept forcing visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston likes to play, where Lithgow and Halkett keep kicking long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final stage of the game, but McGregor held up well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow wide came from the corner.
Invader Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a penalty shot after an attack with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way again.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the almanac of our 'Sunday Morning': September 30, 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom can TELL ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the apparatus called the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has not been out of science since then, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with the first-ever unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: ‘That's a geiger counter. It's used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you design this headphones, you hear the effect of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.'
Evans: ‘It’s really banging now!’
'Hans' Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.

Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells in the course of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a lab
They can then see a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and then be re-injected.
A test vaccine produces promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the immune system to detect malignant cells saw her ovary cancer disappear for more than 18 months
In the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, after which the cells in the laboratory are adjusted so that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which often occurs in various types of cancer. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovary cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and to ‘learn’ these cells to tackle cancer cells was found to work earlier in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West pulls off pro-Trump-tirade and wears MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go as he hoped.
Kanye West was released during a broadcast of Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that he would become President's candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a hat on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he pulled off a draw against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
‘When I talk to a white man, I ask him, ‘How can you sympathize with Trump now? He’s a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I'd been leaving America for a long time," he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon struck the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee on Justice regarding the alleged assault that Christine Blasey Ford accuses him of.
The West's charade was not broadcast, but comic Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear if Rock's post wants to stick the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his hat.
‘They've been paralyzing me backstage.
They said, "Don't step on stage with that hat."
They beat me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see how apathetic it looks?” He said he would attract them to superman cape, “because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the audience, at least twice the shouting and the cast members of SNL appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was told by one present: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.’
West was a guest as a last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest spirits: BELIEVE THAT I MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talk show presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just ‘ordinary himself, and that's beautiful.’
‘But I choose not to reward someone who supports and extorts an ideology that harms my community (by buying music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We too,' she added.
Before the show started, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, ‘the being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He is not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega rapper Snoop Dogg also has the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then to The artist formally known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder after stabbing in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was put down on Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast on Monday before the police officer.
The charge will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington out to toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordfighter Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor goes to the stereotype of the macho hero and says that young boys see such roles on the screen often think they have to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that something had gone wrong and asked himself how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his co-star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
"This is an important question for me personally at the moment: where did it go wrong with our masculinity?" he said.
"What have we learned when men grew up, which is why we are now faced with this problem?"
Kit thinks that television might be partly responsible for the increase in toxic manhood, because of his very male characters.
He continued, ‘What is born and what is taught?’
What is learned on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions of today: how do we change that?
'Cause there's obviously something wrong with young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he would not perform in prequels or sequences of Games of Thrones when the series ended next summer, for he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses’.
From November on Kit will be playing in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is an assailant.
The actor recently revealed that he found that his encounter with his wife Rose was the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the show, so that's how I kept my future family and my life to it from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded with an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China reports an increase of 14% in the number of Chinese people with HIV and AIDS.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected by it in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed on through sex, which was not the case before.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people this way is almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transfer of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been no longer criminalized in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
According to studies, the conservative values of the country estimated that 70 to 90% of men having sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member has leaked data from Republican Senators and leads to ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘complot theories’
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters opposes the accusations that one of her staff members posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the accusations are spread by “extremely right” opponents and websites.
“Lows, lies, and more common lies,” Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published data would include the private address and private phone number of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
They were posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill at a hearing of the Senate Commission on the allegations of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate judge at the Supreme Court of Justice.
The leak came after the three Senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address was that indicates the source of the posts linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters employee, said Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no case responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie.'
Waters' statement quickly encountered criticism online, among other things by former press officer of the White House Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds angry’, Fleischer wrote.
“From here you can say that she does not have the temperament to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
He doesn't have to be rebellious.
He should not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take the place of Waters in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Hefty, if it is true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false accusations.
“We will make the perpetrators known,” she said, “and they will be legally held accountable for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to my staff.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we now traditionally look for references to the Brexit, and that certainly applies to this revival of the Johnny English-Franchise, the comic action films with a sloppy spy in the main role, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and was re-established with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Does this airy self-destruct become about how bad we do it the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with exhausting eyes and flexible facials succeeds in sending everything in the hundred, including his second comeback. From his name you can already derive that he is a general comic character that was conceived for cinematographers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is of course the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a grin of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots or Fire during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
He was originally based on the traveller and the international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the television spots of Barclaycard (who has forgotten everyone) who always leaves a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I found it wonderful how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and tick the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson can show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough excessive, especially now the "serious" movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do well.
The humor seems to be more intended for children than for adults, and I find Johnny English's crazy disaster less original and more focused than the jokes without the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain known, to the great horror of the agent in function, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that makes the bucket run over from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson is doing her utmost with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the script doesn't offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisors, she has to use a retired spy, as each active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but informally teaches about undercover work. Here are nice jokes in the story, because the spies of English make you think of School of Rock.
English is quickly denied for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic help Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, an opulent and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloodthirsty woman fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the first minister unfortunately stands for the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start off on their odyssee of clumsy doll fun: dressed as a waiter they burn a watchful French restaurant, they kick noise on board Volta's luxury yacht and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Before that, all the records are opened, but no matter how well-meaning and rude the scene is, she does some thinking about children's television.
It's not all very original.
And just as with the other films by Johnny English, I ask myself the question: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour denies that the party is considering a plan of British work four days a week, but is paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan whereby British workers work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
It is alleged that the party would like to have companies' bosses pass on the savings they make as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day holiday.
For example, employees can enjoy a weekend of three days, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources 'passes' the idea in the party's economic agenda and the plans to make the country's balance sheet go in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Trade Union Confederation, which considers it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen at any other time, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's efforts to make the balance of the economy more profitable for the workers and that also fits within the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the entire Labour Party is not yet supporting the effort.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: "A four-day working week is not a political intention of the party and is neither considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the faceless drivers and the profiteers in utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, because a Labour government could apply 'reductions' on the basis of perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the board of directors of companies and to establish inclusive ownership funds to give 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees who can earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh may change their mind
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview that is broadcast at '60 Minutes' on Sunday, Scott Pelley corresponded to Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI could discover something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, unambiguous."
However, Graham's voice seems to be wall-resistant.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is solid and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday the Global Citizens Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will take place and which is equally impressive: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organised in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international interest leaders who hope to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people who are active in fighting it.
Concertists wishing to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, making a phone call, or in another meaningful way generating awareness for the goal: ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizens Festival been, with another 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just another form of "clictivism", giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
According to Global Citizens, since 2011, more than 19 million 'actions' have been registered by supporters, aimed at a large number of different goals.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to global leaders' commitment and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that will have to change the lives of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or brought together by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of helping children realize their full potential. This group has pledged $35 million to help Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country after having received over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and global citizens like you, we can make a foothold in history of the social injustice that is malnourished," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government announced that it would support a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizens' website asking, "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
The group replied: "It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes falling and failing.
But, like civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will ultimately be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform this year during the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the navy for a 'block' to hinder Russian energy exports - Minister of Home Affairs
Washington could 'if necessary' resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from coming into the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the US Minister of Home Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the involvement of Russia in Syria, where the country is responding to the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just like in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said in the report.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has that possibility, with the navy, to ensure that the waterways remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke for invited people at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a profit-free group that displays itself as the 'voice of the energy consumer' in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that it did not differ significantly.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels," he said and referred to Russia as a country that only knows a 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to encourage the export of liquid natural gas to Europe while replacing Russia, a country which by far offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw its view from the 'inappropriate' Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trum van Berlin, has made Moscow's 'inmate'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Minister for Energy, in Moscow in September.
The US position has attracted a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, called on the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'rethinks seriously' to take part in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from Massachusetts said on Saturday that she 'thinks hard' to take part in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
During a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the elections.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political news magazine The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously think about it in order to elect me President."
Warren ran out against President Donald Trump at the town hall meeting and said he "sends this country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is causing in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this."
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own party felt that it should not stand for election by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the Senator should not stand for election, according to an opinion poll by the Political Research Center of Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent was for her to stand for election.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent ahead of a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to a report from the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSS from Track Palin at an election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking up duty in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"By what my own son has to experience now that he is back, I understand other families who are suffering the consequences of PTSS and the injuries that some of our soldiers are facing," she told the audience present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they're coming back a little differently, they're coming back and they're getting harder, they're coming back and wondering if there's respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and is accused of domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report about domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new US policy refusing asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. made a statement last Friday as a 'friend of the court' to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker challenging this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Freedoms Union filed in August against federal policy has not been announced.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that American officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was then detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people apply for asylum in the US, as countries that have major problems in terms of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals from 2014, which made it possible for immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "misses decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is stated in the declaration of the "friend of the Court".
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the US harms the US economy, because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provides for the necessary labour force'.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, in June, ordered judges no longer to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asial is available to those fleeing their country for persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political view", said Sessions in its announcement on 11 June.
Asian was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even if these are serious problems that make people around the world every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu while the number of dead doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also got worse.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, trying to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed homes and sought valuable supplies in their vernacular possessions that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injury and the hospitals are overcrowded, provided they are not damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder rested outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of severe post-shocking.
Tears filled his eyes when he told of his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was printed against the remains of a wall," Haris told a correspondent of the Associated Press and added he was with his family in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and our kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda ads'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper posted an advertisement of four pages in an American daily, celebrating the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump later referred to the paid annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of interference in the November 6 American Congresses, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections marked, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in a Washington escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed ever higher import prices on each other.
China's retaliatory rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states such as Iowa who support the Republican Trump Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and previously long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had affected American workers, farmers and companies.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion paper in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "now doubles the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China makes use of freedom of expression and free press, a long-runned tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast to a kiosk in the centre of Beijing, you will find in vain different voices and you will not see a true reflection of the different views of the Chinese population on the difficult economic path, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article," as he did not say to which newspaper it was.
Through the Kavanaugh-debacle the Republicans alienated women voters just before the mid-term elections, warning analysts
Now that many important Republicans are working around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, analysts warn that this will result in a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions around this subject have grown tremendously and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to continue voting.
"These things cannot be turned back," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Again, he said that he was wondering if Senator Jeff Flake's attempt to argue for an FBI investigation at the last moment would be sufficient to satisfy the angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they haven't forgotten it tomorrow, and they haven't forgotten it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday according to the Washington news magazine, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters called "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate Hall, while the Republicans who have elected the Justice Committee to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go further, especially among female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, from 18 to 29 years, who often do not vote even if they do not agree with the President".
Even before the Ford public testimony, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the candidate before the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there could be a setback if the Republicans were to enforce the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, last week according to NBC News.
"It's not just the vote in committee, or the final vote, or that Kavanaugh is sitting in court, but it's also the way in which the Republicans have handled it and how they have treated it," says Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, clearly on the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be divided on the question of who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, where a small majority sign up on the side of the latter.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believe the testimony of Ford and 35 percent believe surely or probably Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh certainly or probably lied during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's advance, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations of Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford last week, before the Senate Justice Committee, declared under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate before the Supreme Court showed her his genitals during a party in the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inruptly, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid van Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the opportunity to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contacts, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored in this library.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment by means of data".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, developers of technology around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to talk with "Facebook and Google about introducing or not introducing a complete transformation that will put all their business models on their heads in one time".
"We do not ask their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: clergyman and supporter of the Victoria Cross from WO I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a military is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharp shooter, so he never knew that the highest British military honor had fallen on him.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was brilliant symbolic that the stone was exposed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather had been distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on 29 September 1918 over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire of field guns and machine guns".
He later stormed to the fire line and led the line forward before he only ran to a field gun and turned off three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German shooter on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something, something I know I can never touch, but also something that makes me feel humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "feel very honoured to be allowed to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a true hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've stayed awake all night watching a successive Bellator 206 and you won't see the most important moment.
There were 13 battles on the San Jose sticker ticket, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset because they stayed awake all night especially for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to government regulations, content that is not suitable for children should no longer be displayed after 6:00 a.m. and that's why we had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yesss."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator's company, said that they are going to adapt their programming to ensure that viewers in the United Kingdom will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the return competition, we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, a lot of text messages went back and forth and believe me, these weren't all as kind as they were.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise you this won't happen a second time.
We limited the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we did normally, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual orientation
Olympic cleaner Tom Daley says that he felt inferior during his childhood because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary school, he did not realize that 'not everyone is like me'.
In a conversation with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said that he had spoken about homosexual rights to give hope to others.
He also said that parenting had contributed to his less value in winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show has taken a few months off for illness.
Appearing as a shift on Laverne's first program, Daley told us that during his childhood he felt 'lesser' than others because 'socially it was not accepted to like both girls and boys'.
He said, "Until today, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was 'someone' so that he wouldn't let people down if they finally got behind his nature.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he thought he was happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others 'hope'.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, 'has completely surprised me'.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"If you have to endure so much when you are so young," he took part in his first 14-year-old Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same high and low points.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have said it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after he had received the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if she had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, you won't be there anymore to sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breaths really stopped and he died, I could finally acknowledge that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew I had been dreaming about this all my life, diving for a home audience at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, which had touched him heavily on his way to the games and which he still received from him.
Desert Island Discs can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he must find his form to not make a sad milestone of it.
Mickelson, who takes part for the 12th time in the biannual event, a record, was placed on the bench by the team captain Jim Furyk for the four-balls and four-somes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing in the driving range, in an attempt to find out what it is suspending.
Since he was never known for his straight drives even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for Le Golf National's narrow fairways, where the long grass of the rough-throated balls routinely punishes.
And if the job itself is not yet frightening enough, Mickelson will come in the ninth match on Sunday the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans behind four points at the start of the 12 single matches start well, Mickelson's match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has proven to have confidence in this man, although, frankly, he could hardly do otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, struck me on the back, struck his arm around me and said he was ready for it tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been recorded in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play only two matches.
I would have expected more of it, but it is as it is and it is the way we thought we had to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never fully matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games in his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain untouchable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to make jokes with people, and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to fool him sometimes too last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great headway can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advance ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
Deen made his debut in the competition in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points on the Americans, but finally the finish line passed with the smallest margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, here called, after he had seen the 2018 light win by 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all the others in the team that this is not a game yet.
Everyone will have to make every effort tomorrow.
Get to work and run the plan on the right one.
It is not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is this trophy winning, and we must continue to focus on that.
I keep saying it, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Welcomed the performance of its players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead with things in this area.
A new challenge awaits tomorrow.
Tomorrow the individual performances will be discussed, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's okay, but when you're there alone, you'll only be really tested as a golfer.
That's the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than their partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind on the last day, as a member of the winning Brookline team and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Mirakel of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in answer to Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, picking up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the moment, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have aligned our line-up to this and send the men along the way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try to magic something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the offensive and puts Rory McIlroy in front of the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," Bjorn said of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have come into service in 2014, replacing the outdated warships of the Cold War, but it will last at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and rising costs, reported local media.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the news magazine Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the outdated Bremen class frigates.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and a form of steel technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to use the latest frigates up to two years apart, far from home ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to give Germany the opportunity to project its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they are taken into service, Die Zeit notes.
The final frigate F125 took the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it were deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen-class.
It was also made clear that the ship is experiencing a serious overweight, which will reduce performance and limit the ability of the Navy to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class that were deployed by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price card for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also a problem.
It is said that this has reached a gloomy € 3.1 billion, compared to the original € 2.2 billion.
The problems which the latest frigates have in their grip become particularly important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Defence Commission, acknowledged that the Navy has actually "a shortage of deployable ships".
The official said that the problem of time has grown as a snowball, because old ships were taken out of service but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a estate in the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland follows the ordinary and small dwarf bat, the brown large ear bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to follow the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the clocks of the bat and what kind of thing does.
Then a map of the habitat and a report are produced to make a detailed picture on the landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor to the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of pasture fields and how best to maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Fleeen populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, such as fly-catchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and house tax attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly investigate, inspect sleeping places and sometimes rescue actions.
The organization has even established the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the estate Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species live in Scotland.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, very old trees and the right habitats.
But there is so much not yet known about bats and therefore the work we do here and in other locations will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of monitoring bats before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place could lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, possibly eliminating a full local population.
Bats are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall into trouble or to disturb them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and of many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo's accusations of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people want to 'promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the accusations were published.
The tip of Portugal and Juventus is accused of the assault of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to keep silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33 hours after the accusations were reported, called the reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the trade.
I'm a happy man, and by and by well," the football player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage to an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, returned to the football room, where he raped her, according to the accusation, anal, as can be read in the indictment filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a 'good guy' for '99 percent', but that he is sometimes abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court arrangement because she was 'afraid of the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to have the scheme declared invalid because she is permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and this summer he left for the Italian giant Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will forever regret it' as car producers leave
The United Kingdom 'will be eternally sorry' if it loses its status as world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that the 'careful' was that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that if Great Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car producer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' jobs would cost.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if Great Britain falls out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of a departure from the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already told us that it will close the Oxford Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
The majority of car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The Toyota production line operates on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, whereby parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars placed on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there may be unrest at the borders which, according to industry, can lead to delays and deficiencies in parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire factory, so the company told, and therefore production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was 'exactly aligned to avoid border controls'.
"We have to have a deal. We want to have the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told the listeners of the Today program of BBC Radio 4'.
"The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to go on with these very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who represents the union Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back.
A public spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the deputy prosecutor general Rod Rosenstein can 'already be postponed a week' while the fight over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and possible impediment to justice by the President.
The question of whether Trump is going to fire the deputy attorney general and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has been on the rise for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record discussions with Trump and to release the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors went round that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to "do not love" Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday Sarah Sanders, Trump's persecutor, appeared on Fox News.
Asked for the meeting with Rosenstein she said: "There is no date for this, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed a week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the shortage of press conferences was not caused by a rejection of the 'thinking' TV journalists, though, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more questions and answers than any president for him," she said, without providing any proof of this, "we've looked at the numbers."
Press conferences will still be held, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do that a lot and you've seen us do that in the last few weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries visiting.
Press conferences with the President alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president was able to demonstrate why, he made an open and at times bizarre appearance for the collected reporters.
Health Minister writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish that they will continue to work with the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already stated its willingness to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
But at the same time, the UK government has also suspended preparations for a possible scenario where no deal is reached.
I know these must be uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of NHS and that provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is surely your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery after having reached the head injury
The linebakcer of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, went on an emergency operation yesterday after having suffered a major injury in the 31-27 lost game against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ van de Tennessean.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there more or more," said Reed.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for further research.
An official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that 'no details are yet known about the type/size of the injury' and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a red shirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He scored a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him scored a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralise Corbyn's success to attract young voters
The increase in the fee is charged to persons who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects this £120 million per year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK and the extra yield is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn that attracts young voters with promises to ensure more affordable homes and to tell stories to many earners.
The increase in the lay-offs is imposed on persons and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, where the extra income is put in an attempt by the government to combat homeless people.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current leases, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses bought for rent, may amount to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million per year in this way.
It is estimated that 13% of new construction in London is bought by people who do not live in the UK, which drives prices up and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the home charger.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had argued for a reduction in the layoff to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable houses to restore the 'housing scandal' in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to expulsion 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister on the restoration of the British Dream that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy houses here as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof over the head is already real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his 'extreme ambition' to ever become a manager of Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east of England, which is currently in third place in League One, at three points from the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning the last season of St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership.
"As a football player, I wanted to play for my homeland.
But I was selected for the B team and with it was the cut off," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw my father Scotland playing often in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps me drawn.
However, that option would only come if I were successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Good luck for me is being measured by 'can I have this club return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it should be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself successful when I bring back the club."
Ross is only working as a manager for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the edge of degradation to winning the Championship in the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a football player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he recalled when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did quite well, I deserved quite well and have known some reasonable highlights.
But football can be heavy.
There's a lot of things you're confronted with every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the field, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm real, I'm so good at my skin, as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in summer has raised the revenue of British pubs that have difficulty in surviving, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 per cent in July, but revenues in restaurants were 4.8 per cent lower, showing figures.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Advisory Office, who collected the figures, said: "Continuing sunshine and the fact that England took part in the world championships longer than expected, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had translated 2.8 percent more, with the difference that the restaurants were now hit even harder.
The drop of 1.8 per cent in the turnover of restaurants in June, only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars that are aimed at beverage sales performed by far the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also targeted at the sale of food also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, the drop rate was 6.6 per cent higher for the month, while the food turnover was 3 per cent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors in the output market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a turnover of 4.8% year-on-year is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food-oriented operators and only the time will learn whether the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary boost."
Total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Couffer Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed by 47 operational groups, with a joint turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has a social media secret account that they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some of whom are not older than 11 years, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals an investigation
Survey among 20,000 secondary school students revealed growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a 'head account' that they also show their parents
One in five children, some of whom are no older than 11 years, makes social media accounts that keep them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'head account' that they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who happened to be on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to rape her.
The study, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses) of independent schools, found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two profiles and that half agreed to keep personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said, "It is worrying that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish athletics world, as a non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the board.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports directors to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from its election in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm glad to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can make a contribution and help control the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will learn if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been very hard work, but I have now been completely restored, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the statements of support!"
Advertisement for breast pump comparing mothers with cows, distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has distributed online opinion with an advertisement in which sucking mothers are compared to cows that are milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silent portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, a consumer technology producer, released an ironic, music video inspired ad to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to collapsing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything about it' and 'In case you didn't watch it, these aren't udders, these are my breasts'.
The chorus then goes on with: 'pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies'.
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has directly led to an online controversy.
The video has been watched 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that the 'horror' of the dairy industry is acceptable.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be expected and preferred to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of birth" is written in a reaction.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into a dietary body (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else remarked, "This is, of course, traumatic to mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she thought the song was "Hilaric".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I were still breast-feeding.
That pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a little weird, but I haven't looked too much for it.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, aimed at mothers who pistons (often at the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like being just 'chees'.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who have pistons sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly into a nutrition, so that women have the freedom to move, to hold their babies and even to go out while they are on pistons.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing piggyback mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to place the piston and its associated challenges in the spotlights and at the same time show in a entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has reached a peak, although the number of monthly cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and the harsh policies introduced by the Trump government, making it more difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and fear their own chances of staying in the country by registering for a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household should give their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified at a convention that his organization arrested dozens of people who have registered as sponsors of unaccompanied minors.
The organisation subsequently confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prior record.
"Almost 80% of the sponsors' sponsors' or family members' sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
We're in the process of persecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules, requiring some of them to appear before the court within one month of the start of detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the staff at the shelter
Many of them will be standing before the court through a video conference instead of in person to advocate their application for legal status for an immigration court.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the greater the chance of becoming fearful or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or attempts to escape, according to the shelter staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles more often are ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for this or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria recommends that the US, France and Turkey withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also a vice-president, said that the foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that 'this will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been derooted and expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "possibly illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he accused 'only Western countries of spreading irrational fears', leaving most refugees away.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicalizing a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid for Syria will not be available until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel force, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has turned away a large-scale attack from Syrian troops in the province, supported by Russia, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that this agreement had 'clear deadlines' and said he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who would 'shall be eradicated'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN delegate, hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution after the war for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to reviewing the articles of the current Constitution' and he warned against external interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers are likely to hope, his presidency was prematurely terminated by a detention procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime time viewing figures at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC's 'The Rachel Maddow Show' is at the top of the cable program reviews with 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the person responsible for the ABC drama 'Designated Survivor', a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scout, an experienced comedy writer and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he's laughing at me," Scovel told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Disablement is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you see that you've been watching a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who are talking about Paul Manafort's peacock that has cost $15,000 ('a garment full of pride' according to The Washington Post) and are discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
In any case, I will never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's a reality show is partly that he's shutting you down something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the sudden daily changes (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you have the idea that you're behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not remove himself from the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh, who had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember doing all these weird shows, not so long ago, and people said "this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting mid-term elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an abundance of money, thanks to a redistribution of a constituency, which requires two sitting representatives to fight for the same seat.
The newly re-divided district of Pittsburgh meets the Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take the stand against another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is very much familiar with the new 17th district.
The cards were redistributed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally classified ('gerrymandering') to the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knockout in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nifty victory in a well-considered special election for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied for more than ten years by a Republican and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points of difference.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
US considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China and refraining from doing so
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognised and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners put out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the United States Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to call back the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision not to recognize Taiwan', said Heather Nauert, the minister's spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
But only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in US aid in 2017, for controlling narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings were being held, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants leaving for the United States.
But in mid-September, some senior government officials announced that they wanted the conference to go on, thereby making all possible criminal measures against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence will address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the government's importance to the meeting, say diplomats.
And the three American Messengers have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further abstinence, without any hard messages about Washington's criminal measures.
A spokesman from the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The next step can be the report of the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counter-feiting of Trump's justice, for which serious evidence has now become public.
Mueller is also likely to focus his research on collaboration between the Trump campaign and Russia in a Russian attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes its colour, Trump will have to take responsibility for that institute, just as he is preparing to turn to the voters again, and perhaps he will have to take responsibility for a jury in a court of law.
These are a lot of things, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of its counterparts in Europe.
There will have to be choices made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, who will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'statt against Hitler, but only if the West had offered resistance and the Czechoslovakian government had supported it in Munich.
We therefore failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such convoluted points and the inexorable progress of democracy is thus accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently faced with a number of such bending points.
What will we do if Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time this magazine reported that he had, last year, suggested that talks with the President be kept secret and that he had speculated about the President's suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says The Times report is wrong.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the interim elections for a Congress that Trump will call to account?
If we fail these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail by the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived it, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me away to light candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika was depicted.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers get Rapid Vienna on Thursday visit and know that a victory on the Austrians, after the impressive equation in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, the midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first match of the season until the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleven," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out with a point.
Maybe even we could have won at the end, but seen throughout the game a similar game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can score three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they also had a good result in their last game, but if the audience is going to stand behind us, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been heavy, of all that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feel-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can now push through, leave behind the last season and become successful again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of their pension
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said that they were talking about the costs of long - term care with their spouses.
And only 10% said they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes known in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take a financial advisor: Your advisor can also advise you on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term care funding options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or investing in own funds as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up legal documents: Avoid legal battle when the insurance has to be deployed.
Provide a health care authority so that you can appoint a trusted person who can review your medical care and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure the invoices are paid if you can't do this yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly father or mother having a medical emergency and going to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Put these details in a written plan, so you have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What medicines are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes."
Shoot several times with air pressure rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, belly and hand.
Agents described the cover, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'voluntary act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the number of deaths will rise further.
Because the means of communication have been disabled, the official bodies have not yet received information from the Governorate of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Mid-Celebes and lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami struck.
Dongglala is a municipality in the Celebes region of northern France.
In 2017, the government, an administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Mid-Celebes, particularly in the coastal area of Dongglala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly affected by tsunamis in the last hundred years, according to the Agency for Disaster Reduction of Indonesia.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Dongglala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed a total of 226 000 lives along the Indian coasts, more than half of it in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with 6.8 on the Richter scale took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the scale of Richter hit the city of Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake with 7.5 on the Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and required about 300 lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Regent Pidie in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, because the people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami followed this time, but more than 100 people found death by falling buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and made sure that thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's eldest son, the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-presidentship, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition during the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman who was known tried to call the police to report the alleged offenders, he took off her phone.
Palin is held in detention in the Mat-Su detention house with a bail of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, certainly' when he was asked to, reported the network.
Palin is charged with three class A violations, which means that he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B violation, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was charged with the abuse of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now before the vet court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of abuse in the domestic atmosphere, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group, having linked her son's violent behaviour to PTSS, that he would have remained in his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-force earthquake on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been disabled while the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just next to the centre of Celebes, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
Videos are circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal Prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal Prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, in which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, used, according to the charges, a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, driving pedestrians and cyclists who came on his path in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'intentionally' killed the eight victims and 'intentionally' caused serious physical injuries, according to the statement of intent requiring the death penalty, which was submitted in the Southern District of New York.
In both cases, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Week after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in favour of a rocket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and she describes how Sajpov carried out the attack as 'wrong, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellayevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" states in the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than ten years since a case was brought in the Southern District of New York to demand the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was implemented in a federal case in New York was in 1953 before Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who was executed after they were sentenced two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his act, the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after viewing videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He pleaded not to be guilty to the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was 'naturally disappointed' with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in return for a life-long prison sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those concerned," said Patton.
The defense of Sajpov had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MEP says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to mobilize a 'people's army' during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the 'heat' of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants in the March in Birmingham that the UK would 'be out' as Mr. Farage Brexit Minister had been.
But the challenge that May is facing in reconciling the highly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise on the road while being attacked by Brexit, Remainers and the EU.
Co-operatives maintained that they will continue and will try to conclude a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, and thus force Eurosceptici and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw 'Chequers in the trash basket'.
He proposed that Farage should be knighted and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did the service, we'd be out now," said Bone.
The MEP for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers in the trash basket."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone pointed out that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely untrue."
Conservative Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also took part in March and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a directed message for May, she added: "Firsts keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'heat' if they want to betray the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we're not gonna let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to put the fire on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the people's army of this country that has given us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and closed this March with a meeting of two hours in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of Labour University, joked about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the unbridled border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'think good' about candidacy for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she 'will think well about her candidacy for the presidency' after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican's deputy who was co-chair of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculation that she could possibly fight Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
One present asked her if she would stand for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after death of Wayde Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday reported that a suspect was arrested after the death of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot wound in the head and died of the consequences," police officer Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and known to have been present at the scene of the crime, in possession of a firearm and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and held in detention in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98 metre junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started the last season in 10 games. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him victory after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and let Hamilton stand almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his team mate.
Vettel went into the pits and allowed Hamilton to drive in the crowd's busy tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later went into the pits and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on top after a wheel-on-wheel action which meant that the Ferrari rider had to release space on the inside after a double movement in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
After that, he was a long leader of the race, as he remained with his band and micked on fast finish so that he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Eventually he went to the pits in the 44th round, he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, making Raikkonen fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did his best all weekend, and he was a real gentleman and left me behind.
The team has done its best for places one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday about the fact that she was not continuing to be the source of Christine Blasey Ford's leaked letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not speak directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he informed that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, untrue and untrue'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that is taking place in the Senate in the last few days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and leaks and then they say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you laugh?
Remember her answer... did you read the document... "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't laugh."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't. "He added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which the accusations were reported to Kavanaugh's address to Feinstein sent by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was leaking.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't read her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go confidential, and I treated it confidential, as she had asked."
But the president turned out not to believe her denial and he commented on it during the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Further, with his defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the President suggested that the Democrats use the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power with all the necessary means.
You see the commonality, the ignorance, they don't give anything to who they hurt, who they have to drive to seize power and get control back" would the President have said according to a report from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have made up for the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return competition in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had taken the lead with two goals by scores by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team by the side before Dwyer led the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard made the matchmaker for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make up a backlog on Friday night to defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three games.
The opening goal of Dwyer came at 3:35 in the fourth minute on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the advance for the co-maker of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants had a lead in the first rest, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team recaptured and Bouchard brought them back to an equal position with a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the race, late in the second period. He ensured the victory with the fifth goal for his team, half way in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, are playing home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies, ensuring that hundreds of people can escape the earthquake on an aircraft
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could rise safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
The area is still under great aftershocks and many have been buried under the tip of the town of Palu.
In spite of the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly moving traffic tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was ready at that time on the runway, could safely ascend.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirai, a spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision has possibly saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported from Australia.
We had a helicopter scheduled for Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter had reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can rise to the thousands, and the Agency for the Fighting Disasters of the country has announced that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is assumed that the number of deaths is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Yellows reaching a height of six metres have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is engaged in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the military present: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says there is one man missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline operating the flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now saying that one more man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon one male passenger is missing.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the rest of the passengers and crew members after the aircraft was hit by water during the landing at the Chuekeia airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane was shot over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes told us that he and some others managed to pass the water that came to their disposal to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the Stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a not serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that seamen who were at work in the vicinity of a shipyard have also helped in the rescue work by bringing people to the coast with an inflatable boat before the plane sank further into the about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that over the past 20 years 111 persons have been killed in crashes by air carriers registered with the PNG, but that this does not concern Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor closed his claim on Friday in the reopened trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for a few hours as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the phone call records to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she left life.
Rowlett told us that he had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was at Chambers's on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford again.
Sanford was in the witness's bench on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told him that he was in his truck at Sanford during that night, Sanford said that he 's lying because my truck was in Nashville.'
Another contradiction was that Tellis had told me that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicated they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said Tellis knew the texts, calls, and contact details on his phone some time after Chambers died.
"He knew her from his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to start the deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hiphoptrio wants to question the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol states that hiphop has been alienated from origin with political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had an upsurge in Britain again by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A childhood girl from New York faces a couple before the court because of a 'racist' text
A midwife from New York faces a couple before the court for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a wrongly sent text in which the mother complained about 'again such a black'.
The couple denies being a racist and calls the trial "abbreviation".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her horror when she discovered that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a negative woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
'NEEEEEE WEER ZO'N SWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs Maurice.
According to the American newspaper the New York Post, the 'uneasy' Plasco-Flaxman, Mrs. Maurice, when she realized her blunder, declared that her previous childhood, Afro-American, had done a bad job, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice challenges the couple for the court to get a compensation of $350 per day for the 6 months for which she was hired to bid at home, though without a contract.
'I want them to feel like you', Maurice says last Friday in the New York Post, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple bit off on the claim that she was a racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they, by insulting her, were afraid that they could not trust her anymore.
"My wife sent her a message she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists, Joel Plasco told husband to the New York Post.
'But would you leave your children to someone who had insulted you, even if it was an accident?
Your newborn baby?
"Shut up."
Compared to 'pressing', Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and 'in a very difficult situation'.
"You're going to prosecute someone like that?
That is not so sympathetic', added the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion is rapidly involved in captivating the couple to social media, where they are hoarded for their behaviour and reasoning.
Paddington publishers feared that the public would not be interested in a talking bear, reveals newly opened letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It is difficult to get in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we know now about Paddington's huge success, it's very pleasant."
She told us that her father, who, before being inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, as a cameraman working at the British radio station BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book felt 'bitterzoet' after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said, that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, humble man."
'But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost seemed like a child's achievement; you're proud while you didn't do anything about it yourself.
I think he was about to experience Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for success.'
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors sought to save her life in vain.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that she was expected not to make it', Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then the call came from Nad to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love your treasure so much.
We'll be back soon.
I'll be back with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumped out slowly and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process turned everything down.
I could just sit there knowing what was going on.
I couldn't regret, scream or cry, because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I really needed to be tall."
In the end, Ms Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning about the death of her daughter, stepped into the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I sat down with my head and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Rousting women stick messages on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women loved ones are lost by suicide, making themselves strong to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like how I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and resident in Lydney, Gloucestershire County, England, tells us that her son was a promising chef with a powerful grin.
"He was known for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room."
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had robbed himself of life.
Mrs Davis said: 'I am constantly concerned that a chain reaction is coming.'
Mrs Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep quiet - talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he felt gloomy or depressed or anything," she said.
'A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all on the ground on Christmas Day - when the children unpacked their gifts he didn't look at them at all or anything."
She said that his death was a big trauma before they were, but that they had to deal with it: "It's tearing the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as the FBI investigates
'I thought that if we could get what he was asking for; an investigation limited in time and size, we might be able to create more unity again', said Mr. Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling 'out', in the midst of a firmly anchored patrol within the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have already taken place in five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as is expected, the Republicans are doing wrong, their efforts to have their husband elected to the highest court in the country will be seriously difficult.
George W. Bush has already called members of the American Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and so his wife Ashley met, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has the report ready?
There will then be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to cast the determining vote to confirm Mr Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
Number of survivors in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean survivors has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, states that there were 1,127 survivors last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park noted that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for smugglers, were the main factors for the fall.
Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The vast majority of the North Korean survivors are finally offered South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily secured demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the survivors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often violently deports them.
Relations between North and South, which are still formally in a state of war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, in particular on the staggered negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the US President, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they largely agreed to work towards the nuclear dismantling of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
"Without faith in the United States' actions, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances there is no first step towards unilateral disarmament," said Mr Ri at a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, named candidate judge for the United States Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday during the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like that, they would call her 'hysterical', Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very moved; he was screaming almost and was particularly upset when he told about his family and high school age.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, in which he called the accusations against him 'great and coordinated character murder', organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she found that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and by the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats," Pelosi says.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to institute impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh if he were appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
'I can say this about that; if he does not tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he now serves', Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia (usually shortened D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would go against the "Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade", which is known as a conservative judge.
Mr Kavanaugh raised questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
"Don't expect us to be cheered if a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed to the Supreme Court," Pelosi says.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a righteous tyrant of months and years of grieving anger that passes over, and she can only cry out to get it out.
'We're going to cry when we get angry', Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She went on to say: 'I've been greatly helped by a woman who was a leader somewhere and who told me that she too was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method whereby she used to cry when she got angry. Against the one she was talking to, she said: 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just cried.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Teas are partially permitted as expression of anger, because crying is essentially incomprehensible.
One of my best memories from a former job, in an office dominated by men, was when I had to cry awfully because I was incredibly angry. An older woman, a guy company leader who was a little afraid of, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Democratic Congress, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'kattenkwaad' or 'Apengeläde') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder considered that there was no reason why she would not apply.
"It wasn't a deliberate decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
'There were already 7 other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because the campaign had already been advanced, she was behind with fund recruitment, and so she solemnly promised not to participate if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
"Do they think I might get a discount?" she asked.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she was not going to start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of parliamentarians, and of anger at sexism - that she instigated.
'They'll have thought I'd get a nervous breakdown,' Ms. Schroeder remembered how the media responded to her.
'They'll have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She's crying"?
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The opening columns of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and although the battle has not been fought for a long time, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts, cover for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the US President, gave earlier this year the first warning by increasing taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for 200 billion dollars (150 billion euros) of goods; half of all goods coming from China's USA.
Beijing has taken each time in natural reprisals, most recently by increasing tariffs from 5 to 10% for 60 billion dollars of US goods.
China has promised to equalize the USA every time, and the worlds on a second-largest economy will probably not quickly blink with their eyes.
To allow Washington to bend, requests must be granted, but publicly bowing to the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing were to play smart, the trade war with the US, China would be able to support positively in the longer term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions, which would allow one of the two countries to fall into free economic trap, is actually much more dangerous than observers had previously recognised', says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Centre for a New American Security, a think tank dedicated to national security issues, focusing on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war lasting over seven years.
During his address to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that conditions in his country improved.
'In the meantime, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism' he says.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All the circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that some six million people are still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in restoring the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn's team achieved the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling almost the whole tournament, let his long battle end up in the water from tea at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shined in all its rounds and became one of the four players who once won 5-0-0 since the tournament in its current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, playing 5 holes down and 4 holes down.
The highest ranked player on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play Ian Poulter from Britain, who possibly played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
'The enormous pride I feel because I beat Tiger Woods. I've been following that guy all the time when I grew up,' says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
The American leader, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team: 'I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
We have made Europe a little harder this morning.
We offered resistance.
All due respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players on his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We've been beaten."
Red glow update: Concentrations decrease in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission shows a general decline in red glow concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay Area (located on the west coast of Florida in the US).
According to the committee, the reports indicate a fragmentary increase in red glow in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The red glow extends over an average of 200 km of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
There are about 16 km to the coast of Hillsborough County spots, but in less places than last week.
Red glow has also been seen in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations have been reported on the coast of Pinellas County last week, low to high concentrations on the coast of Hillsborough County, high to high concentrations in Manatee County, high to high concentrations at or on the coast of Sarasota County, high to high concentrations in Charlotte County, high to high to high concentrations at or on the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are reports of airway irritation in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
No airway irritation was reported in northwestern Florida last week.
