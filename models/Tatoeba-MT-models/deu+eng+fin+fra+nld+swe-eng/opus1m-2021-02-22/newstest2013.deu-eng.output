A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama’s Reelection
The Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, confirming that electoral fraud in the United States is rarer than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
By the way, the Republican lawyers recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the conduct of elections in each state.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have announced new laws that make registration or the removal process more difficult.
This phenomenon has gained importance following the November 2010 elections, where 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time limits for the early vote, declare the right to register as a voter invalid on the election day, and give citizens the right to vote for which a court is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state has requested voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The Republican authorities have made rapid progress in extending this practice to other states.
Over the last two years, they have promoted draft laws in 34 states, forcing voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people entitled to vote, do not have a photo ID issued by a government authority in their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such a card in 2012.
However, there is often more than a hundred dollars to be paid to obtain the required ID.
Young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.
That's enough.
Students who are regarded as voters who are more and more voting for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more for the Republican side to use the maps issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state called for proof of citizenship to be chosen.
Arizona was the first state to make such a request.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that demand that voters prove their US citizenship.
The aim of these measures is to limit the number of Spanish votes.
It is obvious that two out of three Afghan voters prefer a democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 promoted laws in eight states that abolished the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign to register voters in the 2004 general elections helped to register some 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the proportion of registrations of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for the premature vote.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although they make up only 13% of the state's voters.
The same applies to the people of Spanish.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites who represented 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters who pre-elected.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID to be displayed.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear goal to influence the results in the countries that determine the year 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that have passed these laws are 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral panel to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows incorrect results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation for men who are already unsolved to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have received the opinion of two specialists.
The studies carried out in the USA have had numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition.
This study has also shown that, in the case of follow-up at 12 years, the probability of the formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been identified.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must be made truly aware of the extent of the risk of his cancer by identifying the possible options where prostate cancers can remain untreated if the quality of life is not affected in the long run, and in these cases it is more likely to be actively monitored.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active monitoring and treatment when the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be determined are determined with increasing accuracy.
That is why I nevertheless recommend that the test be carried out.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not he should be performed.
In cooperation with the international Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that allows the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test to be evaluated.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer prevention.
Despite progress in research, the assumption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone were to eat well and move well enough.
"If there were no smokers, this would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, around 10% of cancers are expected to be caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unexplained.
The fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority for the Canadian cancer society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously harms the health of people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraged data: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and obesity also contribute to the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, grim intestine, mast, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects the whole life from flue-like cancer," he adds.
Foodstuffs
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity it increases the risk of suffering from a grim or mast cancer.
Wrestling products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer, another showed more of an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family predisposition.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs-Boson has aroused a certain amount of excitement last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
Finally, it is the last particle, whose existence of the standard model - our best or least false explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - was predicted, but empirically not yet observed.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented at a major physics conference in Kyoto this week, but data is still missing to be completely secure.
However, let us assume that this is actually the Higgs, because apparently there is only a small risk of cheating, and let us look at what it is all about.
In this world, there is an inevitably indispensable law, which means that two objects cannot be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too hard because you will get hurt.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to them as well: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantity state", whereby this "state" consists largely of some of their characteristics.
From this the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner there are the good citizens, who are called Fermiones and are kind of obeying the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons are moving, a bad band of anarchists who are not holy - at least not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups, according to the website The Particle Adventure, by the Berkeley laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing): the mesons that we will not treat here and the "particles of power", through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
But it has to be stressed here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bote" of electromagnetic force.
If a particle with an electric charge accelerates or the direction changes, the electromagnetic field is exactly in this place "disturbed", like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbation" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "threshers of the force".
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, has to be "disturbed" so that this boson shows up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must achieve very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be feared by a very large rock.
That is why a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a size of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
There are indeed not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold itself on the refrigerator.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those doing so possess a mass, while the others (as by the way, the photon) do not possess a mass.
For what can all these researches be "good", does Mrs Plamondon ask?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to examine exactly all the differences between the observations and the forecasts of the SM.
There are, by the way, numerous physicists who are eagerly hoping that such deviations will be found, as the least difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
One has to say that the latter still has great shortcomings, because it does not explain the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (renews ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Impact
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no such thing.
By the way: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in the Bell labs did not assume that their works would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but otherwise nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first long-range laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 himself - has already said that the laser was considered at the beginning rather than a "laboratory playing".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also arise from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, during his work in optics, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor.
Although it wasn't the original purpose, this sensor now serves as an eye for all digital cameras worldwide and has won him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can really never know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life with its Committee on Death in Dignity.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, which ate him, had given him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said, half-hearted, lying in his bed in the home for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he wishes to be helped while eating.
Couragefully, he even manages to smile and speak to strangers who are busy around him, bring him his drugs, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"During our life, we learn that a man pees standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.
"This depends on the ability of the person", to take a step backwards, he notes.
In the view of several people working in the Palliative Care, major events take place in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients who are sent to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who care for them will no longer be overcrowded with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But through the illness I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she says, before accepting that a mask is put on to help her breathe.
She still expects a final visit to her son from Italy in the next few days.
At the Victor-Gadbois home you can offer with a group of volunteers body care and help with the food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other possibilities.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is a bed for the palliative care of 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if you take into account that one day we're all going to die.
Life will continue here under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is granted oral care with Brandy or Pepsi, as desired.
Diabetic patients no longer have to check their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drown the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We are helping families and patients alike," says care director Nathalie Savard.
At home Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other.
Aside from an old 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his pillows, while being held in his honor, a 36-year-old young man, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two little children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"Since six months, three to five beds have always been filled with cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel says worriedly.
53% of the patients admitted to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter has reached the final stage of their lives, either at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois's home and the company for residential palliative care in the Greater Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great insufficiency in the health care of Quebec that makes sure that a number of doctors specialised in palliative care are confronted with concerns about the adoption of a law on the regulation of death aid and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been in circulation signed by prominent figures of the Palliative Care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that all rights to high-quality palliative care are guaranteed before they are accepted as a means of dying.
Shortly ago, she says, I saw a patient who had 14 days of great pain in the emergency room without taking measures to alleviate it.
I fear that patients will only die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of the worst forecasts obliterated until the last day.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I would give up the fight, she told me.
But she told me I was in the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nurse for not allowing this desire after their pain has been alleviated by a team of Palliative Care.
However, it must be clearly stated that the palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, Head of Palliative Care of the Society of Domestic Palliative Care of Greater Montreal, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors thus often resort to the terminal sedation, which leads to either sporadic or permanent inclusion of the patient until the time of his death.
We can no longer act as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly be able to access this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me in," but "I want my pain to be alleviated."
The realization of this report was possible through a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the Road Construction Office, construction companies, money buyers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell each day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosos are involved.
An industry which was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has broken down since it took drastic action," jokes Jacques Ducesneau, Member of Parliament in Quebec and former head of Montreal Police.
The scandal was revealed by him as a result of an in-depth investigation of the distortions related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which the Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to at the time.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he stresses, "the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved $1 billion in the contracts" because some instincted to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011 is also making great efforts with its troops in auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau-Truppe", which since 2009 has caused the Montreal "channel cartel" to proceed with the artificial inflating of the contracts.
Over the past few weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal executives such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who are mayors of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his office as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected to have repeatedly received lubricated funds in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, the engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were highly accused.
The latter has raised awareness by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has had his hand in play everywhere in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals who were in power back then.
He was also able to organize an illegal acquisition of funds for the former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts whose costs were artificially bloated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736.000 in return for drainage contracts which he artificially burns up.
Other road construction officials admitted that they were lubricated by artificially burning the bills with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately disregarding a shadow budget that filled his funds with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which led to a severe crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to hit the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, from 2010 she refused to sell a municipal property that was purchased for $5 million and sold on the booming real estate market for 1.6 million.
70% Black money in election campaigns
From the investigation, which is finally carried out, she says that she "draws to a thread that allows her to understand the functioning of the ants-immigrated system in order to stop the evil and to denounce the guilty."
She says that the procedure is "painful, but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we need an investigation unit only for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "the officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but above all they think about the role of the "managers who are in the picture about the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a 70% share of black money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was just a weak outcry of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "As long as election campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money in politics will be in circulation."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by courageously bringing things to the ground, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at taking a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not Barcelona FC!"
In this season you have assumed a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
One can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my playing level every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
Everything's going very fast in football.
But I don't get excited.
From my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progressive progress.
They thus make use of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
New arrivals this summer are used to performing games at very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is decisive.
This leads to a player like me having to offer the forehead and want to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti gives respect to all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and it is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he's going to win another title in Paris.
In January, I conducted an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he put in me is also a explanation of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of the leader.
But we're laughing in the back.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the aim of the club in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to say our word against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can carry out the playback of the eighth finale as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He's already got the budget for...
In order to become a major European association, Paris has to win titles and make itself a name in the long term.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG will provide the funds to ensure that this project takes concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really up to us to give up this title.
Last season, we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We've finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be a master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseilles, Lyons or Bordeaux are calling for the title, I think we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win 4-0 in a home game against Troyes, and you still find something you can blame us for, it is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people still expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we proved strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, and which has also made huge spending!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to be on the break with 15 points advantage!
This meant that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we finally won it despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much so that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their playing level.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also enables all others to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
It's like a disappointment.
It was in my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from hitting out some game time.
I've seen things there that I've come out of.
Today I manage to perform good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "blue".
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we have to show exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "blue"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the player and encourages victory.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "blue" to Brazil.
Is the decision taken on October 16 in Spain a trigger game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone's been working for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which enables direct file exchange.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers in the network.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the bitcoin price reached a peak of $30 (23 euros in June 2011, it fell five months later to $2 before it recovered to around $10 today (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes return) through games.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, each time trade is monitored and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneous book keepers, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins are available in the public accounts invoiced throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner who is a kind of temporary central banker who has the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing gets "cracked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unconnected, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred millionths, leaving some room for manoeuvre...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with every improvement in computing performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites providing Bitcoin services were attacked and Bitcoin deposits stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not relate to the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for paying with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB shall also report on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse to donate this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the bill book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega Final Sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are therefore cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by the dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat states that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend where hierarchical systems are covered in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to get through, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
Moreover, the ECB's report provides for the reassessment of the various risks that are now regarded as high risk in the event of the success of this currency.
We've been removed from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain its possession of its territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we punished Afghan farmers by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and loved.
The Taliban are foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek and Tajik.
Toleranceed, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I have observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed by French loans, was carried out properly.
The truck and tank convoys overflew by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more inflow of the Taliban into Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overtaken by the war due to the struggles of the various rebel groups.
Their taking of power was then regarded as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into merchants by seizing property from the government to sell it as a construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive U.S. subcontracting of subcontracts.
They brought themselves to trial, and most of them were not themselves involved in the struggles.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just as those who could make use of the American subsidies: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are sick of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to corruption of certain leaders, will have to make jobs available.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed of mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now there.
Will the authorities under whose authority it is under control be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province who will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a certain decentralisation using the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the Prime Minister's office, which has existed since the 1964 Constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralised state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, in particular during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional storage facilities are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country founded on 30 years of war, state control of the infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was widespread that Afghanistan possessed immense land resources.
This still reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only there to empower themselves.
No energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or no means of transport for an export via the mountains is possible.
The Chinese have almost left Mes Aynak's copper mine, let the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) make their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's most important employers.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which imports and exports are largely dependent, to re-establish normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls' and boys' gymnasiums, French Institute at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit activities and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation in order to try to "get hearts and spirits" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These works, for which many local workers were required, have helped to suppress the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural areas.
What souvenirs do we leave after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys of over 2,000 metres.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the rebellion led by foreign groups, according to their own statements, the continuation of civilian aid would be necessary for their benefit, if it were to be reduced, well controlled and directly affected.
A Constitution with the Brechstang in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever with regard to the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary session two additional months to complete his work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been relying on a text which has been provisionally amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal confusion.
This new initiative has only brought about an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "stepping justice with his feet".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to renounce their intention to explain to the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the President, it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy while the protests are raging throughout the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will be happy to vote.
In particular, an ultimatum is put to the Egyptian people with this recourse to an accelerated vote: "Neither does it agree with my draft or I keep the unlimited authority", the latter was supposed to end after the Constitution was adopted.
85 Most of the Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals have not complied with the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they felt that they had not been able to put their views into effect.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to reach a decision, 11 people, deputy members, were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some are very close to the Moslems.
It is not surprising that the articles were generally adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it interesting, by the way, that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed for prayer at the time, since some members of the committee felt that the pendant watch of the congregating assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which all drew attention to itself, remains the same as that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made it possible for a stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Holyness" is the answer to the liberals who regard this only as a propaganda strike.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
In doing so, they have in particular the eye of Article 220, which confers an advisory role on the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the people invited to deliver an opinion have not been elected and do not possess any democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of theocracy".
The fears of the Liberals are also nourished by the fact that the next Rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is currently no concrete religious commitment to be recognized.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
It admits, however, that "in relation to Article 220 there may be a ambiguity, since the terms used are derived from the religious vocabulary.
One refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, Note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to how far civil courts are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Moslems argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In line with the military's wishes, the examination of the defence budget is not presented to Parliament but to a national defence council.
There will also be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights associations have demanded.
The latter also share their concerns regarding the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
Blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no longer refers to the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to express himself on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists await sacred places, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and an unspoilt nature.
AIF will name you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Bend Before Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It means that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the conversion of water into wine at a wedding celebration, walking on water, the silence of the sea tower and fishing.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the sanctuaries are found in Jerusalem.
The path of suffering or the Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa) is carried out by believers here.
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the grave church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the salving stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, in the Christian view, is the umbilical navel of the world symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands in the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree grew, from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the walls of complaint, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 A.D..
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave there paper with wishes that then go into fulfillment.
Take a trip uphill
The ruins of the Massada fortress form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies that Herod of the Great built for his family in the year 25 AD.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at a height of 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins of their own strength.
All the others bring a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at altitude from 1600 to 2040 meters is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can reach it with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were allegedly living on the mountaintop.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are almost 300 museums.
Not all of them can be visited on one trip.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
One of these is the Israel Museum, not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea found in rock caves in the Judean desert are kept, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bath servants.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum guides nor souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most striking section is the monument for the children built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the space there is complete darkness.
Star funnel.
And the names of the children of the Jews and of the lands in which they died shall be heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for your health
The three main recreational areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
There are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums in each of the three places.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is bathed in the winter months as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathed throughout the year.
By the way, with a position of 417 meters below sea level, this unusual sea is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even carries non-swimmingers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt soles) and healing mud as well as for the treatment of inflammation of the skin, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and the calming of stressed nerves.
Touch the secrets of antiquity
These secrets contain the old town of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous seaway, which linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia, ran together.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he led a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after stars.
According to legend, Fortuna is to be held by all who touch the walls in the alley with their starsign.
In Jaffa, you can find newly married couples from all over Israel and even from other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strip through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In the Roman era Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre evening concerts and operas are performed today.
Favourites for tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money on the trip is not taken with you in euros, but in dollars that can simply be exchanged in shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city, you usually get ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed train and in Haifa the country's only subway line with six stations connecting the lower town with the upper town.
In fact, it is an underground cable car.
A ride within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the mode of transport, which is enough for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, excluding pork, seafood, fish without sheds and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between various dishes of ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pure beans and peas (flakes) as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israel’s cities there are no strangling dogs.
For this, there are many well-kept cats who strut comfortably and unheavyly through the streets.
In the evening they are even seen sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like places to be lively and don't say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a car rental costs between 37 dollars a day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance also costs 15 dollars a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
The average cost of admission tickets for museums is 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and holiday seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Country, which represents an increase of 51% compared with the reference period in 2010, before lifting the visa requirement on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MPs and citizens' lawyers are discussing the benefits of the Law on Compulsory Language Tests for Migrants, criminals are already dealing with counterfeit certificates.
Each year 13 million host workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are Central Asian citizens: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families remaining in the home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force requiring every migrant worker to take a test attesting knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in the retail trade.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
In doing so, we must not only carry out language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for the maintenance and extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Also excluded are persons who received their certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Purpose, problems and protection of rights
The examination units will be run by the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of Friends of Peoples, Moscow State University, St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take tests in all cities; already more than 160 centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the MPs of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the law came into force in the press several times, civil rights lawyers asked the following question: What does this really mean?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills, both for the Russians and for the host workers?
Above all, the purpose of reducing the number of forced labour is to dissociate the spokesman of the Migration Agency.
"Many people are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelev, Head of Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected before their departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Problems are encountered by unskilled migrants, education, language skills and medical examinations.
Zebelev is convinced that a future migrants without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who put him under the pretext of help in a dark, narrow barrack, where he will endure with dozens of his like months without food and documents and will create 12 to 14 hours a day.
Many complaints from our migrants reach us.
"In your home country, the one promise will be made, and when you arrive, you will be betrayed, their passports will be taken away and will not receive the promised wage," confirmed Tolib Schwaripov, Head of Labour Migration Administration of the Tajik Migration Agency.
Don't be shy, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, admit that they are not only able to speak the language of the destination country, but also can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmens, Usbeks and Tajik can achieve reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone buy them decent clothes, shoes and school goods.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil society lawyers stress the following important aspects of the law.
The test must only be carried out by legal migrants.
If you do not have this status, there is no exam and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers continue to stay illegally in Russia.
"Holy welcome" or "Forbidden access"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are for the most part faked and we are not registered, and cases of blackmail arise from this.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamov says to journalists.
"Don't hide any costs for false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it became apparent that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by Federal Migration Agency staff.
The faked papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get it for nothing: each migrant who hoped to be able to avoid the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important direct task is to protect the system from corruption so that certificates cannot be purchased simply means that both officials and civil servants agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will have time for a basic language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered places in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal arms market
Extremely low rate of legal weapons in criminal offences
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to tighten up the arms law for private arms owners.
The authorities thus react to the recent events: injured at shootings at weddings and seven dead at the amok run of Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov.
The police want to ban the use of non-lethal weapons in the public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was endorsed by the Chair of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the arms law will be submitted shortly to the Duma.
Not all of them are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, the authors of which - representatives of various arms associations - are calling on the authorities to distance themselves from "senseless exacerbations".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal justice, Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed during the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from serving on the black market.
According to the authors, at the moment Moscow can find any weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons are delivered to the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for ten years.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen both by the Russian officers and the Caucasuss themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel come illegal weapons, which are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen both from the police's arms chambers and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that there were cases of arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, arms manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
"Today there are countless private armaments factories that do not withstand international competition and therefore the weapons are being disposed of in the black market, for example in Moscow," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own, sometimes handcrafted production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in the delivery of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on arms portals.
According to the investigators, most of the illegal weapons come from the army and the law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons in the black market were there by the "ship of those responsible who have come to do with weapons in their work", according to the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% are from theft in the production of weapons, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A sales advisor from a non-named arms store assures us that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since been purchased by no one because they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get the after-sales in a weapons warehouse.
A weapon, such as a TT-type gun, is bought via a fan.
The weapon is issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealer takes the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything and, therefore, if they are unable to comply with the plan for the detection of crime, they carry out periodic purchases of control at dealers offering illegal weapons," the sales advisor adds.
"Like in luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find each other most often via acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone drew attention to me and suggested that I come to the station "Begovaja" where a person would wait for me who would take me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
I only learned the price of the weapon there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales advisor. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him."
There are merchants in the markets, but you have to go there and get along with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets you adjust that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even getting a few rings about a friend I trust.
He's also giving me the rings because he knows I'm not getting him.
Novels are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He received a photo album in which "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt like a luxury shop," the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy, but go with the seller to the forest, and there we set a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the gun has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vcontacts", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "Buy a gun or rifle".
There, users place your orders and ask questions.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", users ask "Iwan" (literally quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow" is the laconic question of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the network to join the service.
People come to feed like hungry fish and then land in Siberia and are allowed to pick coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible parties accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that you can also go out empty and come behind grids to the end when you place an inquiry on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the network to join the service.
"People come to feed like hungry fish and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to pick coal," he says.
One Makarrow for 100 US dollars
According to experts, buying illegal firearms is expected at prices ranging from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a Makarrow gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait for one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapon camps by mid-range overseers.
According to official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offences involving illegal weapons in the whole of Russia declined by 7% to 22.9 thousand during the period January to October 2011, while the number of reported cases of theft and blackmail related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
Every fourth U.S. youth sits behind the cashier of Mc Donald's
Over the past few days, there have been massive protests against low wages throughout the United States in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will blow even further, or whether they will soon be out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organisers of the protests pursue the aim of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organized in trade unions.
46 cents a year?
Protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the USA that attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to quantities of hands.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and worked together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, whose target group is people with low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from windmills, hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many of the low-paid Walmart employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The protesters on Black Friday called for wage increases and expressed their concern that the contribution to the company's own health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour cannot afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company raised the average salary to 12 dollars per hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That's about 1.1% more than they donate for pay now.
If Walmart would fully transfer the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be for them per year compared to today's additional spending of only 12.39 dollars.
Proponents of Walmart note with satisfaction that there were only protests in nine states and that they did not give the company any losses.
The Black Friday took the next day in its shop from 8 am on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
On "Black Friday", the Walmart cash registers accounted for nearly 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees in total had ceased their work and the protest action had only been "an additional PR trick" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal, however, was not Walmart-Filials (who do not want to be in this advanced city and are therefore not in existence so far), but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of dollars, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumane Williams, Member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get 8.90 US dollars an hour.
Less than she deserves nobody in this expensive city.
As it is possible to spend so little money in New York, I'm incomprehensible.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. teens stood behind the counter at McDonald's school, but the teenagers still lived with their parents.
Hardly one saw in it the main source of income or planned to stay longer there.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I constantly encounter people who complain that they have to deal with this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants of the protests that began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than doubling the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the management of the company from being in the way of this goal and from ordering or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff fluctuations.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The peak of the protests was a meeting at noon before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including city councilman Jumane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sold billions of dollars, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food workers so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, not all of whom are in the fast-food sector, where tens of thousands work in New York City.
It is not yet possible to see whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain can only be overlisted moderately so far"
The theme of advanced reality, popular with followers of modern technologies, has been perceived recently by the lens of special glasses.
Google first presented a working model at its annual conference in summer, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for a corresponding patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses for the company's scientists were only a transit station.
It stimulates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with mere hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please describe the research your group is conducting.
- We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely remained in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are progressing, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much still plays on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also his environment.
Then we could supplement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality heroes!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but won't she be overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution because it raises privacy issues, because it does not always want to inform everyone about its actions and intentions.
Actually, every type of interaction with computers is good, but every one in their particular niche.
For example, in the area of the control of objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and short gestures instead of exhausting them.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a watch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gesticism and language.
- How's that?
- For example, we'd ask you to give you this sprudelosis?
They say it and at the same time indicate it.
- Normally, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the respective time and not?
- Not necessarily, but it's about a rapprochement.
I think that we will have to work on the development of new sensor types in the near future, which will allow us to capture reactions from individuals more closely.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you place on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main things are not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
It is necessary not only to consider the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and openly said, the present 30 fps are too little especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed in our Redmond laboratory a touch sensor with a adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or amplify the problem as more calculations would be necessary.
Nice would be a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of advanced reality in everyday life the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand, but I think the following: The greatest variant would be a "changing" expanded reality, in which we could switch over a cloud from glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there lies their strength (private can only see you), but at the same time their weakness, because an expanded reality by means of glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to ordinary mortals.
There is a problem that often points to critics of this idea: there is no noticeable reaction!
The hands don't feel anything at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak of the expanded reality as the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could certainly be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a slightly unusual projection document.
She's doing a great job of printing!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" something hand-held, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is at the moment but still so weak as someone pushed over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to overpower the brain?
It makes you think it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely to allow a person who is physically in a closed room to believe, he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be overlisted moderately, and many years of work are still ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: on many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the "Petersburg avant-garde" project, dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the list were already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city's borders and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bear dressed in red, which you can find at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at the scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever Kirill Miller's pictures are exhibited, they attract large masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city and, through his presence on the street, enchants his fellow citizens with a smile in the face and gives them a good mood.
A short time ago, he took a film organ and became a St. Petersburg film organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist's being, his philosophy and his image.
Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in town?
I chose the color Red as a fashion designer that deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artists, image advisors and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the grey norm is a source of aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Cultural Palace Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from it came "Puschkinskaja 10", and then was first finished.
It attracts me to theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything, except literature.
And all of this came together in your kind of clinic... it was important to me to be at the centre of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, where there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemian House of Petersburg Bohemia until the renovation works.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to play-back, wore tight jerseys and also belonged to today's popular composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, it became a "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have its origins in the art clinic.
Our employees and regular guests went there.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the award "Personalities of Our City".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and so I had reached the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares me to be like that.
In a clown, all this goes wrong and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, if we save the world, we prescribe that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone is paying attention to the clothes and is oriented towards the outside and not towards the inside of the human being.
But maybe you can't give a man his hand, but you should spit him in the face.
The deception disappears by the disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban film organ player.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful, too?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattery.
We see the collapse of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: Bohemian people loved one and the simple people loved another.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollars note everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- But several thousand of the performances of Stas Michailow!
- He has abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy the reached.
In my youth I painted such pictures, which even hung in a row at a collector with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something completely different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
Kirill, what's the matter with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said: servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars might not understand much of culture, but they understood that the right experts are necessary.
There are currently good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have those who might be the experts, but they are blocked, as it requires higher-ranking experts to properly evaluate the former and clear the way for them.
Now only one taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding soil.
Art can only grow heavily on our stones.
We need a cultural soil, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
This is much less for us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from grants from the City of St Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Earth warming or collision with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthmen on board are searching for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, does the important question arise as to how we can reproduce in gravity or on the substitute planet?
I do not think there are many options.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"The name of Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the Astronomic Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are relatively life-friendly, the surface of Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The question of reproduction in all the researchers first dealt with the flora.
As early as half a century before, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of orbit-breeding heirs did not differ least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more accurately of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, Wachteleier was sent to space all over the world to explore how weightlessness affects embryo development.
It develops a very normal chicken.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chicks must stop; they must be able to stand on their feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychew, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems.
Without a solid base, the chicks are wildly overcrowded.
Ten hours later the instincts of the newborns fell down completely.
The chicks did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they just died.
"Two times we let chicks slip and then put the whole thing in, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," said Vladimir Sychew for the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew to the orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special has been found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and research needs to be continued," says Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats got young.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
In contrast to animals, man could do so in principle.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk at Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that mankind has is the female organism.
Our monk flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Is she left space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"Finally no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, bore a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also a Cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even worked outside the space vehicle, bore a son.
Nevertheless, there is still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more dangerous it is even for flights into the orbit," concluded Cosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolabor in the cosmonaut preparation centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a state of sweat, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water to be pleasant, it is a foreign environment; yet infants feel water to be a natural element.
It's as if the little Ichtyanders were testifying that life in the land was getting away from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the fruit water, and the fact that it can become more easily used to water.
In principle, this makes sense, since from birth until the first swimming just two weeks passed.
"This is not enough time to forget something," says baby swim instructor Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child the weightlessness is a much more natural condition, the woman does not leave without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decline enormously rapidly and thus also declines the ability to push out the child.
All right, let's bypass the birth-leading tool.
For example, the birth could take place in a special chamber to press out the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth’s pull, the organism cannot train the skeletal and muscle.
A newborn child cannot be put into a load suit in the orbit like an adult for training.
He simply lacks what is essential to his life.
"This experiment, which we do together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the creation of a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person," says Igor Pestow, Director of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes reality when the earth’s inhabitants in their spaceships break into a distant planet that will be home for its all-born descendants.
NKő Chief: Control of the black system failed due to political negligence
In the context of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws, but it is not able to apply them.
In the discussion for Aktuálně.cz, this is said by the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nouvy the control of the NK), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I do not think this is the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be common control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he points out the appointment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - is the system therefore banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the head of government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is once again the control of compliance with the law, hinders its activities," Kala notes.
At the check-up committee meeting of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project, which compared the laws of both countries on public contracts.
What was it about?
This is a parallel examination that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is about European legislators defining how public contracts can be handled, building on national legislation, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have found very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even more "harder and perfect", but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over again. It is also necessary to consider the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project?
Such joint control could help us to stop constantly striving for the perfection of laws and the reduction and elimination of thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economy means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paper crane" and those looking for gaps in the system have much easier to exploit than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here to our NK, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKū is the Federal Accounting Court, which is built up just like us and also has a college that is formed only slightly differently. In principle, however, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also to a certain extent comparable, but Germany is a state, i.e. there are these accounts also in the individual Länder - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is this perhaps because the examiners are better there?
That is certainly not true, but as I have said, I do not like such comparisons very much.
It is worth noting that even those countries that are a model for us also face problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything to do with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance for your authority of the amendment of the Procurement Act, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this novella is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had any effect on our examinations.
As our controls take place afterwards, we have to expect a certain delay here.
To date, we have felt the effects of the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new instrument of control "detection of risks of uneconomicity" and examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will of course have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law as positive, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become more stringent and can no longer be complied with.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination are liable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) for any non-compliance with the law on the award of contracts equals an infringement of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
Let us first say which path is not targeted.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not provide entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it is not easy for the head of government to come and the control office, whose duty is once again to control compliance with the law, hinders its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the matter," but he can't say that we do as if nothing were.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the bidder is excluded with the best offer solely due to defects in form.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think is missing from us.
On the streets there are ice flats, but most of them are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are partly snow and ice smoothes.
However, the roads are generally well accessible, sometimes increased caution is needed.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad the roads were well accessible this morning, snow and ice flats ruled individually.
The temperatures fell to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should get a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
On the ridges of the Erzgebirge, however, there are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the District Road Guard, there was a limited view of fog.
The R6 motorway and the first class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is paid to bridges, for example, where the railways are sometimes required and smooth.
All roads of the second and third class, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, some snow remains required or extended.
In particular, attention should therefore be paid in the higher positions.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some roads in East Bohemia there is a danger of ice smoothing, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes another extended snow layer on the roads, the road and highway directory informs on their websites.
The road masters warn riders against ice smooth, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
Ice smooth can be seen especially on second and third class road routes in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially located on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické Mountains.
An extended snow layer is situated on the streets of Rychnov nad Kn thenou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely free of impact.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it blows a weak wind.
Pilsen District
Today, the streets in Pilsen district are well accessible, but more attention is needed in the area, and the way of driving must be adapted to the weather.
This is cool in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing point.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures then fell, it can come on the streets to ice smooth.
Locally, however, the view will improve during the day.
This information comes from the district road masters.
The D5 motorway is practically unlimited, but the road masters recommend increased attention between the 80th and 131st kilometers.
The first class roads are mainly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the Circles Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice smooths can occasionally occur.
The second and third class roads are wet and therefore the reference to possible required sections is also valid here.
Drivers should be particularly careful on less frequent roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
Today, the snow mash requires drivers to expect to travel in the direction of the altitudes in the district of Olomouc.
After the use of scatter vehicles, snowmatch remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský k the road.
Nightly snow driving forced the road masters to use; according to information from the road administration, snow fell about 3 cm new in the district of Šumperk.
In the other areas of the district, the railways are usually fully accessible.
"In the Šumperk district, snow remains in the altitudes.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to expect snowfall towards Jeseník," said a staff member of the Šumperk Road Administration today to the Agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in the district of Jeseník also had to go out at night, according to their information the roads are clear and wet up to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, the roads are fully accessible, but in the Šternberk district, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the railways are still wet.
District of Ústí nad Labem, District of Liberec
In northern Bohemia, the road masters report several poorly accessible sections of the road.
Apart from several places with snow or ice smooth, the road from Telnice to Knínice is closed in the district of Ústí n.K. according to the traffic police.
Temperatures also remain below zero, so that snow and ice will stay on the streets. From the lowlands, especially south-east of the Bohemian middle mountain, however, no problems are reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice smooth is reported in particular from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this during the night - during the day rain and melting snow, during the night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from road I/13 at the border of the districts of Ústín.L. and Liberec.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches that were pushed from the snow load to the road.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month, the world's downfall is supposed to take place?
That's one of those disaster reports that we're so happy to jump into.
With our band The Tap Tap, we're more than laughing at it and saying that we're the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the collapse of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, the end of which is forecast for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, i.e. 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00 on 20 December.
The end of the concerts is said to be at about the time to which the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific Island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone of 12 hours ahead of us.
Who's this idea come from?
Originally I guess, after which we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we do not only want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the collapse of the world, but also, together with the public, we want to think about the state in which we once hand over this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key chains against the collapse of the world, with which people can also support us through www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap has also recorded, together with other performers, the so-called hymn against the collapse of the world with the title "Worldfall falls out".
Already today the hymn on YouTube is very popular. Will it also be heard at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works and the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn is to be sung at the same time by all performers at all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are transmitted live together in a direct circuit from the Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tom the Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, and Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to the cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We are working hard to involve these people in our projects.
It turns out that most people are interested in working with us and have fun.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of concerts against the collapse of the world?
For the establishment of the accessible education centre Studeo, where we have been working for six years together with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the resources to visit the editors, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be created, in which we will then enter with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What criteria did you choose?
We wanted to create a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere perform with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji the Searchý.
Find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" planned for the future too?
In May we will perform for the first time at the spring in Prague, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small, so far you have been in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It is not as bad as it appears at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be transported in the luggage room. Furthermore, we have to carry many instrument suitcases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that sometimes I have already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad you have a comparison of how it looks with accessibility in each country, how you deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than with us, we witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its beginnings in the East.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not accessible to people with disabilities. It is still unusual there when someone in the wheelchair is travelling alone in the city centre.
It is not even obvious there that you leave a wheelchair driver in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's still a lot of things we're after...
However, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation is always dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not common for a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come out of our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you to set up a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in getting involved with something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and play among other things saxophones, I have founded a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our presenter, L the Angelovič, says, something is out of control (laughs).
But the band only became known in the last few years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that the collaboration with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also begun to actively promote for ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and this is not visible outwards, your performance in a certain sense does not exist.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good readers, high-quality equipment and other things.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that things could be handled differently.
In the show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and is only accepted after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap belongs to it.
Of course, the first impression the spectator has most of the time is compassion; that's only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed something, this is not only progress for themselves, but for the whole of society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, how to hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and you must also ask for some discipline.
This is, in my view, quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have twice a week sample, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, the enthusiasm disappears at many quickly.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them have been involved since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: L the Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop it.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Finds place on the day before the forecast world decline, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21:00
Venues include: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/ Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected by live music and it sounds like a common interpretation of the anthem "Worldfall falls out" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to set up the means for the provision of a multi-functional training centre for disabled persons, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: CZK 25 million
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available on pre-sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth largest member of this space authority. Poland is thus the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started working closely with ESA in 1994 and took part in several ESA projects in the following years.
The path of Poland into space, of course, started much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, not always understanding it.
I recall here, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "Introduction to Cosmoautik".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934 for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognized contribution to the development of space has been appreciated for being named after him by one of the craters on the Earth side of the moon.
Already in 1925 a railway drone was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clarified whether the rocket should be used for starting or braking the drains.
The information to this effect comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered guns.
The research was carried out by the Institute of Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaf Mokryckiegi.
The documents submitted show that the research has been carried out through to the stage of practical tests.
The research was, of course, interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the technical press of the design of a photoelectric hunting dragon by Ing. Rohoziński appeared in the press, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was terminated from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space were published in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this company was in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space are devoted.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space company.
At the time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be expected that the exploration of space would have the future.
As early as 1956, the Polish space company PTA was working to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and in fact PTA became a regular member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarakiewicz (1902 - 1959), was appointed Deputy Chairman of the International Federation of Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later an improved version was built, the RM-1A, and in 1959 started flight tests with the two-stage rocket RM-2 in the Bēdów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to carry out real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high winds.
In 1962, however, further developments were discontinued.
==Meteor-1 rockets==In 1962 to 1965, the meteor-1 rockets were developed as a successor to the first RM rockets.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed from this rocket, which differ from one another in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rockets had a transport space with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B with 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C with 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude was 37 km for all three types.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor 2 rocket was developed at the aviation institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, to which two years later the establishment of a national COSPAR committee followed.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second Intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on charitable work.
This decision sparked a lively debate in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, full movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) there are price tensions.
Under this term, a condition in which the manufacturer tries to survive through the importation of cheap goods in economic competition by "substituting" competition in order to break a larger market share and increase its profit is to be understood.
On a large scale, this means, for most companies, to move their production abroad or to buy it in a favourable way, or to give up their business. The result is a high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, it is necessary to increase public expenditure.
This situation is further reinforced by the fact that the Lords are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus to replace the economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is widely known, so that specific statistics at this point are unnecessary.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in individual economies where governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver private capital to their own population without regard for the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictatorship of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic pressure on long-term unemployment and, on the other, by cutting down on workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between poor and rich.
In Germany, there have been public food levies for poor people for several years, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which employees receive such a low wage that the state must raise its income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal has also been revealed in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all the EU's southern countries will undoubtedly go beyond the same state in which people are forced to emigrate (as it was in the 19th century) or to face a hunger wage on the margins of society, hoping that someday private capital will flow into the country.
Here, naturally, is the question of where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty moves from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, employees at all work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim, to the extreme, that the state is not allowed to participate with capital in its own economy, and that planning economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists closely on its view that the State should not interfere with the economy.
Then you have to ask yourself whether private capital does not influence or even direct the politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual benefit, legislation in which virtually everything is objective, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that, in the absence of finance, a Ministry of State is tasked with drafting draft laws by a private company closely intertwined with industry.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer comes from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are now quickly getting into a situation as described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesars and Pompeius: "The state had long been in decline, and the offices were occupied with violence.
Against embezzlement, by unlawful embezzlement of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew uninhibited, and the people went to vote with already purchased voices" ... "People with character did not apply for office, so that the state had no consul due to this decline for eight months" ... "You really started to talk about the only medicine in this difficult situation being a single rule, and that a strong man had to be elected" ... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the single rule.
Today’s society, as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is by its very nature not in a position to recognise and enforce the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, today and then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who do not strive at the least for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the fall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially disastrous is the fact that today's elites are facing the potential future loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters of which we are already witnesses, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution here, at least not a lasting one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state's capital participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Labor des Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is "...so we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be any," says the dying Goode Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
The two stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians as terrorists; the others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is responsible and who is victim in these recurring waves of killing; in the end, today's inhabitants of Israel, including self-government, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence itself.
It is about opening up the reader's view behind the scenes, the view on whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East are especially helpful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and are drawn from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether someone was behind their throne who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must recognize that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated less in the hands of individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power arising from it has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is a particular one that could be described as the head of the crack (I don't know if anyone else is standing over them, but I don't exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about her.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the 90s of the 19th century to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which was always the consolidation of their power, the increase of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are conducting wars or equipping themselves for them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafi only four remained, while Russia in the meantime has placed its central bank under the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began during the Civil War to issue his own (say, state) banknotes and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for the outbreak of the world economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the Rothschild's global wave of power led to the formulation of a plan for the disengagement of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The aim of the first war was to eliminate the great monarchic states of Europe, the second war was to break down especially the colonial rule of Britain, and the third war was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their convenience and luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenicalism is nothing more than the precedent here) and ultimately lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds works at the top is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chaos - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are incorrect and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see founding of the FED, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat).
After they succeeded in triggering World War I through the murder of the Habsburg throne successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian tsar kingdom by the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian tsar empire), and then the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the politicians allowed the bankers to create a latent situation of conflict by occupying Germany with gigantic war repairs; thereby creating the condition for impoverished masses, so that they had to cheer the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader, who offered the debtors names and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-popular Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, who should take on the function of a fifth colony and also took on the task of flaking war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, already mentioned, created the prerequisites for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was loosed from the chain at which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything was going according to plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers manage to unleash this war, the Jewish people will be the victims in the front line of the war, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East, similar to World War II.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think about how sharply people divide themselves into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the debtor and who is the victim of the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with at the beginning the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
One must distinguish here between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, are exclusively their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-provoking politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing all he can to spark a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.), could rapidly expand into a global conflict and, because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, the 20% of global oil supplies, could lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller from 1994: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their conception, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth a chip to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free ones and the servants all give themselves a painting mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, for he has the painting mark, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, whosoever has understanding, consider the number of the beast.
For there is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: If it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist students occupied the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostages.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the fallen Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had kept the patronage over his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - it could not afford to throw the Shah on board, as this would have seriously damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt of hostage liberation only made everything worse.
The diplomats captured were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been arranged by the Algerian government.
The fate of hostages brought out a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the USA a small partial victory.
Right before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy staff managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff who allegedly visited film locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order for the cover to be credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialist journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful housepiece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and easily oversawed.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the floor of office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded with this film a remarkable restart of his career.
A smiled actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the Crime No Children's Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without Grace (2010).
At the same time it is Affleck's first film, which does not play in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that removed the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywoods.
However, Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran of Canada is "played".
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the entrance sequence of the destruction of the message is very impressive in its perceptuality, yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictableness that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team also have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the wrong movie staff on a Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the film sense.
But with the few he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality - which then doesn't always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at Tehran Airport is turned away from a telephone in America, or even the persecution hunt on the runway, seem a bit clever).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide scattering, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have earned more space, and so they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses a bit of pull. It is a film that can be tracked with a certain interest and, at the same time, the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th century.
However, enthusiasm is only a matter of difficulty.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive to this day, and as proof of it, as has been overtaken by the ideas of the omnipotent and omnipresent secret services, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which calls out an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to hold the competition "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea, the EU's recent plan to introduce a 40% female quota in the management of large European companies brought us," said Patrik Nacher, who is looking after the organisation of this survey, told Právo newspaper.
For example, the European Court of Justice’s judgment on the harmonisation of insurance tariffs for men and women is among the nominated absurdities.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they are objectively less risk to insurance companies.
"Other incredible entries from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place by the end of February 2013", said Nachter.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, among other things, the binding blending of bioethanol with fuels that are naturally harmful as a result, the further ban on reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or also the directive on the size of chicken cages, because of which eggs became considerably more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also gained from the actual prohibition of the use of the term "butter spread" or the prohibition on the sale of conventional bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose claims are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce Czech banks' claims with veto pressure).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest commercial class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature abnormal".
The European Commission defended its argument that it only harmonises the uneven national standards that would impede trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have already been avoided by the EU against the resistance of some countries, pointing out that the existing directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to balloons, must be indicated on sale that children under the age of eight must not inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU relied on an American study that, according to balloons, is the leading cause of infant suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual markets.
There are also curious incidents at home.
A directive which concerns European officials themselves is relatively absurd, and anyone who plays an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the Greek issue and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, nominated the above-mentioned absurdities as well as the EU Regulation on the extent of food supplies in the territory of a member country.
The EU thus determined the maximum quantity of food supplies that could be found on the day of our accession to the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for mushroom canned mushrooms, for which we were threatened by a high penalty.
The survey organisers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of providing funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, of course, came not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will be requesting reimbursement from the EU," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the crop was very high and the state stocks were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Because the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission opposed the Czech Republic so far as to organise an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
Funding for funding applications was provided to municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), and should in concrete terms be earmarked for the preparation of funding applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are becoming an easy target for criticism in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to achieve the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve recognition in the opinion of some experts.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects which have nothing at all in common with deepening European integration, but which have been forced into the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also point to the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific terms of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvar theky" after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, the domestic room (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed "Tuzemák".
The name Rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillery, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübecker Marzipans or Parmachinken now also includes Karlsbader Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třebo the Saazer hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubic Lebkuchen or the Hořicer roles can be brushed there.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for President?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If everything worked without any problems in our country, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been looted for 20 years, how thieves walk around freely, while people are raised taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something that I don't like, then I'm trying to suggest a solution to change this.
And since I am already over 40, and independent and parteilios, I have no other way to influence things than to apply for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate, you made it and then made your way to the castle.
Don't you turn your back on your voters?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to take up the fight for the castle after the results of the Senate elections.
Later on, I clarified this and said that I would apply for the President's office if I were elected to the Senate.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and as much mandate as possible.
But the difficulty is not only that we, as a people in the pub and in front of the TV set, are flinging, but we are putting down anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media that want to rob you of the honour, and which confuse the freedom of the word with freedom, are lying.
About me, for example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Ji the Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive property statements over 20 million crowns.
You need to change laws for that.
As President, you have no competence in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can submit legislative proposals.
How do you intend to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I was committed to keeping the guide a free business, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the petty-spirited policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, this is deliberately rejected, and the population only stops it.
As an independent partyless person, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without the thought of drawers and party dogmas, I can take from each party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather on the right or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me on the left.
For me, however, this right-wing thinking is completely irrelevant.
For me, it's important that we move on.
It is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You're wrong if someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to get closer to this.
One can call this a populism for me, but all the proposals I have spoken of already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will only be hit.
In the long term, you will not get far in politics.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public, and to try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to enshrine the substantive and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the defendants would then have to say, if necessary, why they reject this.
A strong personality, pointing to abuses, can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just once take the direct election of the President, who was a merit of public pressure.
I'm quite clear that I'm an amateur; I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
With politics, I have just started and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it does not work, I go back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czechs.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't do anything alone; that's why I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don't want to run for Senate.
I spoke to Radim Jančura, for example, but he refused because of work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who revealed the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
My candidacy began with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of voters did not go to the elections at all, and those who went have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and mayors.
Do you think about setting up your own party?
I have not yet thought about this, because I do not have time to review the past of any potential party member, nor do I have the money to do so.
I do not even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there are only CZK 20,000.
You don't have money?
You speak of property statements, how does yours look?
I estimate my private assets at some CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and an Škodu superb that is worth about one million. And then I still have a few million on my account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a childhood dream - James Bond always liked how he drove in the car, was galant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million people in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign by my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live by the senator's salary alone; for example, I could not finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running for anything.
So keep working as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going back to these activities?
But this is not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I have partly returned from my activities.
For example, my deputy in the spring will become Managing Director of the travel office.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
Which monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and so on.
However, as President, I would completely cease my activities.
You will find the full discussion in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in mind - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bookberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerine on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby large business, says, "But it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we need a bookshop for today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No human yet voluntarily goes to one of these Old Style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleep city that is hardly needy to visit in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a record holder.
The 80,000 local government has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictitious bridges shown on the euro notes as pretty brushed steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master the statistics: A library had to come!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam's architectural office MVRDV, master of cool bar diagrams and producer of funny, and often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual calmness and appeared as a competition hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a grinsen in the face.
And while the jury was still perplexed by looking around and sucking with its shoulders, the mad man piled up his exquisite contribution of size to a pyramid and finished his action-based speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So that's him, my proposal for the Bookberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Bookenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million Euro expensive mountain was poured out.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bookberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
This makes it the faceless small town resort, which up to now had no more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an unimaginable ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would tend to suspect a dairy factory in order to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public culture building in the history of its existence.
The Long Path to the Book
The first impression: Bucheldorado under Käselocke.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the real pleasures of space and reading open up when walking up the topography.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lights clearly speak the language of a public square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You already have a look at parkbank, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally the bookshelves are located along the façade, and in the middle is a large dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have placed the classic room configuration on the head and placed the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bookberg is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and house technology centers.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which sometimes have wall cladding, sometimes breastplates, sometimes stilts.
Optics, haptic and smell are strange.
Even incarnate architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Spijkenisse municipality, upon request of the standard.
And so, one day, in a Frisian farm, we came across an appropriate waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields, a millimeter thin plastic floor has been used as a source material in the Netherlands.
That's cheap and time-efficient.
The thin fabric holds on, two seasons, after which it is ready for bulking.
For the library, the nonwoven - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimetres of thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, resistant material that smells like a bissl for new cars and a bissl for sports shoes.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long hike, the Literaturcafé not only rewards you with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and stuffed ficus trees.
They provide the atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donate for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but in spite of the many glass surfaces, this house is a demonstration project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the Bookberg is under a glassfall, the sun itself appears on sunny days only briefly inside.
The wide wooden adhesives, which stand across to the glass facade, serve as shade and capture a large part of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest are fully automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the early skeptic from the IT industry, already paved the way for the new bookshop.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Buchenberg a "long-suffering soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the library that has not yet been fully filled - currently 70,000 pieces - should be filled.
The concept has gone up.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if only it's decorative.
As a result, MVRDV has succeeded in the royal discipline that is called in the specialist jargon identity foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
So young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally an approach to identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, Berlin thus balances at a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the request for observer status of Palestinians with the United Nations.
But then it was Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it came to setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is precisely turning its foreign policy away from a policy that, to put it mildly, was managed by the US, towards a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to say that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans thus find themselves in between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still working on their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as that of France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions that are independent of those of the US or European partners in the case of national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position of the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to attack the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
It certainly matters.
But I wouldn't want to give too much weight to that either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even show some respect for it.
For it does signal that it is taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, on the other hand, clearly voted in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama probably has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I do not think that the actual differences of opinion are as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policy at all.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead push things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive subject.
But I think the German is clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself see itself as an important international player - does Germany want to play a leading role at all?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role to play?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes on a larger role, different anti-German feelings become clear.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable to different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the United States in European policy is constantly decreasing, but the EU is not filling up at the moment, who else is staying?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant for them and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

The name is officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, she enjoys protection for as long as the actual name-tenders do not complain.
And even then, it's not clear whether they get justice.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in protection violations in Far East.
Every week, a new case ends up on my desk.
The imitationrs already have a few additional letters to sign up for their brands.
This makes Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you let Prada-kny enter.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an art name that was also used at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and injured intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell forgery almost exclusively.
But Pattloch's cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he claims that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who are fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame
"This is harmful to business, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the stand alone disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and costs of the industries concerned go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive display products.
According to the market research company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros a year, China is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
But deletions of dubioser entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can proceed with uncertain results.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court dismissed actions because after the long period of time the contested name had become "market integrity".
If the plaintiff has bad luck, he even had to pay the complainant money because he violated his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star until today.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo that reminded of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitations from Hong Kong and Singapore, which allowed the famous crocodile to look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
Although the CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to too little staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, one had returned from "the emergency situation in the course of work to normality".
For example, the stock of untreated opposition proceedings had been reduced by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 appeals are still pending in the office.
Getting started on the other side costs a lot
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were received by CTMO, almost a third more than in 2010.
This was a record and meant that for the tenth time in a row China was adding the list of new applications around the world, the Authority reported.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, in total 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were charged.
Simplified by this means that each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, the case of the German family company Freudenberg costs a lot of attention.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitationd car parts was lifted.
However, the imitationr continued to safeguard Chinese rights at the Freudenberg brand.
One itself had failed, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wenzler, Chairman of the Executive Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO also rejected the objection of the Munichers.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the opponent continues to fight until today.
You have to watch out for yourself!
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wenzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be estimated that the company archive had to look through files even a hundred years old to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much this is worth to us," Wenzler says.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to retreat back to Europe.
That is, if impersonators secure unprotected marks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather in Germany.
This field of business has been abandoned by the Group for a long time, but it was able to reject registration.
"You have to keep an eye out for hell," says Wenzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in dealings with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but the foreigners should "register anything that is somehow worth protecting, even in China", as Wenzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg was left behind in the last act of his brand drama, then you would probably have to pay the opposite license fees for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are delighted.
The history of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there's the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers are looking for the clock on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
First, the singers' voices slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - distress, deceive and pursue themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, takes it almost out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his meekly wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi tries a new song.
The fifty singers have come, from 23 to 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the Hausmann.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
Around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, estimated by Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Prevention Programme.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 people live in AIDS.
In the meantime, more than 40% of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esiteni, the association Voices for Africa found Paten in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storyteller or also praisers.
The Bantu language can speak smoothly in this room, but no one can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and brings them back and forth to where they originally came from: to the South of Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometres of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esiteni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are exposed to the HI virus.
In Esiteni, there is a small number of cases where Swaziland is ill: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Concisions of the male forekin, which are shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in themselves, with about thirty dying is not rare.
On a common Africa trip in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school, you have no chance in a poor country at first.
In the beginning, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But already a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which since then has almost professionally cared for the Aids-Waisen in Esiteni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhoea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis, or hepatitis.
Felt and scratches belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main stakeholder groups?
Syphilis and tripper are particularly common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of the syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis, tripper, and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low - however, around 20 percent of HIV new infections occur in this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur much more frequently than among other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
Human papillomaviruses in young people are also common in this country.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to report.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the year before.
What symptoms indicate a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, urination, discharge, abdominal pain, and bladders or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
In part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricant infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular research especially in frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis can heal most STIs and avoid subsequent consequences.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the gifts that the choir sings in all of Germany, there is a lot coming together.
"All in all, we have already sent some 200 000 euros to Esiteni", says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and persuasive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans stay well, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called on Zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children appear on time to school every day in their uniforms.
Those who have no longer come to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid as much by the club as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI, which many people in the village have had an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obviously the disease is in the whole country, it is most likely to be silenced.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is this state-sanctioned form of life that has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms would exist on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - bottle to bottle."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor travels every two, three years together through southern Africa and sings songs full of sadness, spirit of struggle, confidence and black self-confidence, which many people know at the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already some grim border soldiers to some tears.
The journey always leads to Esiteni, where the singers visit their father children.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Go to Ezitheni, there is the light," the people say.
And when you return to Heidelberg the 8733 kilometers of airline, to the stuttering singers in the trial room on Bergheimer Straße, you see it there too.
Messenger: NASA Discovered Ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is Mercury ice on the planet.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently shaded region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimetres and possibly even up to 20metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that have been struck on the Mercury.
No one, however, connects the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said Messenger Son Sean Solomon, chief scientist.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Earth's citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix to explore the depths of space.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: Small hatchholes in infinite space.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the dwarf planet Ceres.
As Pluto, who circles around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This image section of an infrared recording of the lace telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: The oldest stars can be seen as blue dots, the pink "newborn" in the star circuit hall are more difficult to identify.
This star-forming region - called W5 unromantic scientists - the telescope has discovered lace in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This glistening glut of a dying star has taken up the lace telescope of the Nasa.
The donuts-shaped ring is made of material that the star sank out in the death process.
In the huge Trifid fog, 5400 light-years away from the earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The lace telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the galactic birth hall.
The Pleiades cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colours are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix fog looks at the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is 700 light-years away in the Aquarius constellation.
His similarity to an earthly continent brought this fog to North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be absorbed in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the lace telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How these came about is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon, which disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and sharpest shots of the Hubble telescope: The Hot tub galaxy
Depending on the colour, shots of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid fog in the constellation Schütze, which is several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (triparted, three-split), since dark dust strips make the glowing heart of the star birth place triples.
In the constellation of snakes, astronomers have photographed the prefaces of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light years away from the Earth, the cores of two melting galaxies are rushing together and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
To whom no technical abbreviations lie, she may call her nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a section from the iris nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away fog consists of dust grains, which are ten to one hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was combined from optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy are called scientists UGC 1810.
There is the brightest group of young stars on our Milky Way in this star ring.
The star cradle always produces new young stars.
Also, these star cloud, coupled with the rosette fog, constantly produces new baby stars - 5,000 light years away from the Earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was only shortly after the Big Bang that it was possible to find hydrogen in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope was supposed to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it to watch the stars a year later.
Since then, the optical telescopes' mirrors have become ever larger - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, stands the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows eyes into the room to be immediately above two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap design: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height.
Its special feature: the high light collector power.
This is enough - despite the relatively small mirror diameter - to reach the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the Sea for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope - which honors his name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned on the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should comprise 42 meters - and be put together from almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten metres each.
The keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which next to them looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space supply the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already supplied pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been searching for extra-solar planets - mostly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the final start preparations on the space telescope Kepler are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot into space at the earliest in 2018 on board an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is also ice on the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the Messengers are much closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have meant for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
The Messenger-Sound - the first one that revolves around the Mercury - started in 2004 and the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and become 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible - high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.

A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysh Mountains is wildly romantic.
The small bus roams over the winding road, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here the caucasian group of Talys lives, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Asian and is very durable.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town is full of too much-grazed architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the journey of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers, you need eight hours because the road is only one-way.
The amazing wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Festival in May - and next year we will have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum for Sustainability, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the vita of about eight dozen Talys from the area that is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather. He was 120 years old.
One child born at the age of 136
However, the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd  the  forgery of Müslümov, who is supposed to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented human being, who was 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems highly doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," Fatulayeva explains.
The husband had been married three times and had 23 children; at the age of 136 he was supposed to have given birth to a daughter.
So, at his age, did  the  fortnights cost himself?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also been one of the senior researchers in Central Asia.
"Slightly many high-altitude people also exist in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia extremely many very old men live".
However, due to a lack of documentation, no scientific evidence of age should be provided, especially in the absence of a register of personal status.
Every day melted butter
However, the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik are strikingly often reaching a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why do so many people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that there is food.
But the fact that the calorie-rich food of the Talys is supposed to be so healthy, the meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day, does not seem quite plausible from a scientific point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik.
At the age of 97 she is relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel, which she untiringly rolls up and down.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both long-term grandparents.
Two grandchildren also jump around.
The kitchen prepares tea served in the typical belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly in line and line, under her head cloth she hides long dark-blooded teeth that her son proudly reveals before us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has always eaten only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For my whole life, I didn't buy food for a single time in the supermarket.
Then she tells me about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst time after World War II.
But everything got better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the row.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, hardly knows the borders of Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need for Azerbaijani elders.
230 manat (like the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount from which you can live well.
And maybe Mirzayeva's long-standing son is right: "The ancients enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalizing rallying in Cairo reveal the country's deep division.
The future constitution with Sharia as its basis is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, in front of the people and in front of God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
For they all, until now hopelessly broke up in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of the graces of the powerful Muslim brotherhood.
According to Mohammed Mursi, he almost excused the temporary cutting of the constitutional court's powers and expanded its powers to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, is that the Egyptians are not quite clear about it.
Should the Judicative be released?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were covered by the Islamist-dominated 100-person constitutional assembly there in a 15-hour night parforce ride, are of some concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague formulation and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least a new article to be added: In all matters concerning Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be drawn, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiance throughout Sunni Islam.
That does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy supervise the legislation, which de facto would result in the denunciation of the Judicatives.
Much in the draft text is the subject of interpretation
Also problematic: civilian military justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition forces.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody.
The state should also, so it says in the draft, "protect the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote their morality and values".
This is so vaguely legal that state institutions can even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
No article expressly states the equality of men and women.
To this end, another forbids to insult or slander the Prophet Muhammad and his Messengers.
But what is an insult and how it is to be hated remains unclear.
Dubios also points to the wording that "injury of people" is prohibited.
Is there a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpreting issues, like so much in the draft that Mursi is available for signature, and after his words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for referendum.
"The Revolution has returned"
The opposition has been fighting the Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo in a strange manner and promised to bring down the Charter even before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third placer of the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureates and former chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei declared that the draft constitution was "the wasteberg of history".
Via Short News Twitter, he accused the followers of Mursis of wanting to lead a "push against democracy".
"When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and crash it," said the oppositionist Jasser Said.
"We're not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not ready," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, blew to the area demonstration, but cautiously not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile in front of the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part and cried out, "The people call for the application of God's law."
They asked Mursi, "Clean the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for power over the symbolic Tahrir square, on which everything began, would probably have raised civil-war-like states.
This obviously didn't mean to risk Mursi's followers.
The Muslim brothers declared that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the supporters had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot, in which direction the land should go.
A majority in favour of the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word "human rights" doesn't even apply
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would actually have gone until February and should involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this, he was beaten, sentenced, detained.
"And now the word "human rights" is not even in the new Constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi's extension of power to all three powers in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are gross violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto put it out of force," Saeda complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, who views the ideological direction struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could get revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns, "You're wearing a monster you can't control anymore."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worst smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe but all over the world.
Could the country's secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for rather smelly fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a bunch of dirty, damp sportswear.
And blow her there for a week.
So much so, you have to imagine the wet-smoothing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is fermented in water for up to one year, depending on how stinking one would like his fish to be fermented.
When the darkness comes across the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norweger flows to a feast here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very excellent speciality.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it with a glass of aquavit," says Hapard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but also organizes the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk General".
People around us consume small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," Hapard says.
The spiritosis can push away the smell.
I'll get some chicken.
If one avoids bringing Rakfisk near the nose, it is not bad - like Sushi, who has a quite long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling options yet and fish was drunk in autumn in air-tight salt water barrels.
In the deepest winter it was then removed after long fermentation and - doubtless by means of alcohol-absorbed senses - consumed.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer than Norway not too long ago, streamed immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, though strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often get into the world press, and most people don't seem to mind.
Here one still hates to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, one refers only to the " incident of July 22".
Norwegians are struggling to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, the main responsibility for the present wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our waiter, who distributes round tablets with mature rakfisk and embodied the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the stinging blue eyes.
We are a cautious people, as they say.
Their English is just like that of most people here.
We're not very entertaining, we don't like blasphemy.
Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the sector's revenues is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone threw around with money that they didn't even have, Norway kept its purse closed.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat Rakfisk, of course", she adds with a free laugh.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else.
But in the evening the squid is on the menu again.
The hotel, where I am staying, is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging smell - fish.
There is a live TV scene to a showmaster dressed with fly, surrounded by tellers with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What points do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here's our points, Hapard."
You laugh and you laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict waste of all the fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his office, Will Grant analyses the challenges ahead of him and the mixed feelings of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently very poor.
Even on better days, this is an ever clogged city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built that shuts down several important traffic routes into the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President, Enrique Pena Nieo, will be given the presidential bond and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's faced with a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," explained Pena Nieo at the beginning of this week at the Oval Office to US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he went up to the eye with the US President, Pena Nieto worked as governor of his home country Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new Head of State are shared.
A Direct Man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the resort agree to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the motorways that had Pena Neto built and which represent a great improvement over the fragile, hollow roads that once existed here.
Plates with his name are also hanging outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and sustained change from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as congressman for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change which our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside Los Pinos' presidential palace, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, which the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The town is hidden under motorway crossings and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was called on to combat the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in a spot near a large garbage dump in the last two years.
During Governor Pena Nieto's term of office, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even surpasses that of Ciudad Juarez, who is indicted for their violence and the murders of innocent women.
The critics, Pena Nietos, consider that at least the problem of the killings of women during his term of office has not been adequately addressed.
But in the worst case, his government had closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the downing quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with tears when she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her life mate.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed like her body was washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body star had already deployed.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is attached next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But this is exactly what the family says, so far, they have been denied it.
The authorities treated me like I was a bully, a restless woman, a nerd.
You want to just accept their verdict and keep your mouth shut.
"But that's not possible if there were so many faults and omissions," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the presidential commitment on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have suffered violent crimes over the past six years, and the new President has promised to take particular care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope, as President, he is the same as he was as Governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of that.
The prosecution claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about mistreatment
The prosecutor's office contradicts Bradley Manning's accusations that he had been abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's Time in the Military Prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks to reject the charge due to harsh conditions of detention
The U.S. Army is accused of rejecting thousands of confidential documents
The prosecution tried on Friday to find out that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in American history - failed several occasions to complain about the alleged abuse in military custody.
During a cross-examination Mannings during a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that documents on weekly visits by prison officials during Mannings' nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia did not present any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a motion by the defense to reject the charge - Manning had already been punished by the hard time - Manning had declared that he had considered suicide in prison.
The intelligence analyst of the U.S. Army, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his time in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning completed the forms that officials had completed after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico Military Prison, where he had detained under reinforced conditions of detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as "very professional".
The forms, according to Fein, did not contain any complaints of mistreatment, although the officials Manning had asked directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they were dealing with them, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns) "no problems," and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," says Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to examine the suicidal thoughts he had mentioned on a form several months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to have his observation status downgraded to "prevention of injuries".
The military said it had assigned to him this restrictive status - which is one level below the suicide threat - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince staff that I was doing well and get rid of the observation status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
On Thursday Manning declared his arrest and relocation to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he had considered suicide and had become unconscious due to the heat.
Not to know what was happening to him or to the outside world would have been annoying.
"My world shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in this cage.
When moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was allowed only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and glasses.
Manning said he tried to keep moving, because the day it was forbidden to sleep or even to lie down.
He had to sleep constantly with light that entered his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and could not see his face again, he was awakened to turn again.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Military Prison.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned a charge he raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep a night naked in his cell in Quantico and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had said he never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this countdown.
At the interview on Friday Manning stated that he had concluded from an order of his guard that he should drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself. He admitted, however, that no one had asked him to.
On Thursday Manning had declared that he was forced to sleep naked the night before. He would have tried to show an official that he did not present a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used his underwear or flip flops to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning said that his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and will drastically reduce his detention if he is sentenced to trial before the military court, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will confess to lesser offenses, while other charges, which are considered too extreme, are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecutor's office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners under the highest security conditions in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the favor of the enemy, the unlawful publication of secret information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty at all charges, he is threatened with life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them difficult times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at the pass control when impatience spread in me.
Signs refer to two queues: one for "Mexicoanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic shortcut - just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italians".
Later I decided to "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for abbreviations or bindings.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I'm not going to get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda included all the issues expected when the heads of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. She is one of the reasons that Mexicans today remain with equally high probability in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc, modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue Mexico's war on the drug cartels, even though he did not mention any details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States fell into Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country under a targeted rifle to leave them more than half their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
As soon as a U.S. government official criticises Mexico, the Mexican press and among the country's elites hear complaints about how Americans are harassing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas go on the path of war.
And yet Mexico's greatest challenge lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparents - was not offered a chance in Mexico and emigrated northwards.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark skin, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now have been living the American dream, visiting good schools and receiving good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we are living - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but what concerns our loyalty is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial to a humble defeat and look down upon us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take them badly.
While a US citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they neither belong to nor to the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigers del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as an American.
And in the United States, we're being seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of education citizenship want to resume their connections with the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
Let us tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify its ties with Mexico.
Well.
It won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through that alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans are indignant at how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're "Mexican" than I thought.
Old Battle, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual culpability, countless buildings were laid in shell and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza were fired near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of it.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly patt situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, in view of the current situation, optimism seems to be anything but appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened the hard-wrecked on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back Israelis, even though his group itself had to suffer huge losses.
Although several Hamas leaders were killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip were captured in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far been unable to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have the time on their side.
Just as Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a strengthening regional power once regarded as Israel's narrowest Muslim ally, has taken over the Hamas Party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas followers believe that Israel is a half moon - from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has the power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist influence could stand before the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - by far the strongest and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has sustainably changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot, who ruled Egypt until his fall in 2011 for 30 years, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is drowsy and its leaders depend more on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot be pushed out of Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
Militaryly speaking, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proved successful and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is firmly holding to its position, and many European countries have held Hamas accountable for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least because of the blockades that have entered the West Bank and thus the majority of a possible Palestinian state, but which protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared unlawful by international law, from ever further expansion.
Netanyahu is well on standby. His Likud party, in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman, has allied itself with an even more combative group.
Why also coat these backward Palestinians and leave them a state of their own?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, would they not fire rockets just like their associates in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to enforce themselves, but the Arab Spring could take them a step through.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defence team is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
The fact that the pragmatic President Mursi meets with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think longer term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking remarkable steps towards democratization, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder barrel that will undoubtedly explode one day in Israeli-occupied areas, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an external shock
The correct answer is the one represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: Two states in which Israel leaves territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give the outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now stop arms supplies in the Gaza Strip together with Turkey and Qatar and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by a territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
External Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would be done more to create a Palestinian State than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he neglected the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he was just as reluctant to take part.
But that is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform packaging of cigarettes enter into force
Health warnings and diseased parts of the body on neutral green packs equal to all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive green lids, which are also printed with dramatic pictures showing sick body parts and infants and children who are sick with cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names printed in identical, small fonts is on Saturday.
Australia is thus introducing the most stringent tobacco packaging regulations in the world.
The Australian federal government wants to eliminate smoking among young people by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at 26 will no longer start smoking at 99%.
"You can see from children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to apply for with their brand image," said Tanya Plibersek, Federal Minister of Health. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the least smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour black market trading, leading to cheaper and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian forgers will offer far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that demand for cigarette linings and silicone lids to cover unbearable packaging has increased dramatically since the British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed at the top Australian court two months ago to challenge the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units of wholesale business and is waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, hooking is in the popularity of social media with exactly the population to whom the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from advertising TV, prohibit them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most retailers to stop interpreting cigarettes in shops. Now tobacco advertising is switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Who markets tobacco and only has a small area left to apply for its products is not around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in brand experience written by "very normal people".
You have to ask yourself the question: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that they even record a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, industry is focused on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are trading with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has conducted talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to offer photographic warnings in 2001.
They have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers turn out to be defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a chicken and put away the box," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, where a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the "King of the Pack" tobacco trade in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging made filling his shelves difficult.
"I used to take an hour to order a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have simply banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing," he adds obviously upset.
In a constantly electrified world, it is nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane fell out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to think about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is okay for us - and our children - to be occasionally bored.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring at one or the other screen, we no longer benefit from the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that.
No matter how many people I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't see this.
"In fact, the boredom has a very long story," he says.
Pompeii's walls adorn a Latin graffiti over boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After long reading of research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience of wanting "to carry out a satisfactory activity, but not to be able to do so".
Unfortunately, it differs from apathy by the consequence that the person is not employed, but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time is only slowly passing".
Boringly, this can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or in the world while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are bored, even if we have trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of boredom in the Aspects of Attention" published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a band on which a person presented a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at a low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the hard to hear television said they felt more boredom than the two other groups - they had problems concentrating, couldn't find a reason for it and attributed their troubles to boredom.
When one tries to focus on a difficult or demanding task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you do a simple job - "like looking for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract you and help you not feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that herumzappeln and crayfish, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people physically more attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hang around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit down," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a drowsy speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scale to obese vulnerability".
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are becoming bored more often than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external charms.
But in general teens are a pretty tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor of Human and Social Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of the school’s adults were bored while doing homework, while 23% said they were bored when they weren’t in school.
However, only 3% of parents reported being bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom have increased or declined.
However, he is certain that "youth is felt to be particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no significant influence on their daily lives.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it causes people to take on extreme physical risks and fall away from gambling or drugs to alleviate them - studies have shown that.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been exploring the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain wants to tell you to do something different," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best.
If one is bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you will be happy.
However, in the short term television can cause feelings of happiness, but these disappear in the long term.
The person who reaches an iPad for his bored child can do so from the boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers from one situation to another".
The child not only learns to talk, but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critically.
Instead, our aim should be to make us feel comfortable even away from the constant activity and technology gap.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be bored more often, but boredom is the painful, unceasing desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people, in truth, are only looking for a way to stop and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with the noise once the noise is muted."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands for a criminal offence in South-East Colorado, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some less marijuana broths and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on the road on a September day by car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police found Marihuana in the car, Orozco was pre-loaded for possession of drugs and drug equipment - cavalier crimes, each punishable by a fine of $100 - and received a court term.
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he one of them?
In the uncertain weeks after the government's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for own use, the response for hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of irregularities involving marijuana have already been dropped here and in Washington State, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer pursue adults over 21 years of age for small possessions, which will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they will continue to pursue existing marijuana offences and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new state-licensed marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
"This situation is progressing so quickly that I don't even know what's going to happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, head of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also unwittingly scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drugs - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is considered that Colorado is in any case pre-empting most states as regards the regulation of marijuana. There, the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then legalized for its own use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for Spirits in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a gross guide.
"We don't have a real precedent we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, known as I-502, comes into force on 6 December and thus also constitutes the final point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but which is legally owned.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the government's requirement of "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis business around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nearly, it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle district," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora explaining that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute smaller marijuana offences in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police "from now on" would not seek criminal charges for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce city regulations for medical marijuana farmers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a more stringent view.
After the vote, he indicated that his authority would continue to monitor cases of marijuana ownership, mainly to move consumers to withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people have to take responsibility for possession of about 50 grams or less marijuana in court, although many have also been accused of other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations at the time of the crime," Buck stated in a statement.
The reactions are confusing even in places such as rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer shows adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding property proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and the legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state encouraged a profound gap among local officials with regard to the great green experiment.
With district state lawyers, this is a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the defendant of marijuana offences and speaks on the spot for the national organisation for reforming marijuana laws.
"They spent such a large part of their lives persecuting people for criminal reasons that they still cannot accept legalisation," he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being treated as national cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for legal sales in an age, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as a criminal offence.
Proponents of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite several striking arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to the Obama government, believes that while criminal officials are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to stun themselves to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana transactions under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local authorities approved moratoria for new marijuana transactions, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six-month ban, probably adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our congregation has voted against this change of law.
We are committed to what the community has decided and not to what the state has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It had always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once regarded as the world's greatest stamp of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into the Wolscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke into tears.
My friends were confused.
Evening standard said that I would have gone because I would have had a problem with fellow citizens having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson told me that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had been harassed for only one reason - a reason that seemed so narrowly and cruelly in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: My late father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was in favour of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffer similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same level of equality protection that benefits gays, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College state that because of their political views they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable".
They are calling for a place in the equality committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was worsened by a recently broadcasted documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which Tories represented as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
This was shown, among other things, by graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford University, who was riding in a Rolls-Royce and wearing a silver suit and silver-plated walking stick.
In other universities, conservative students say that they are regarded as "sound blocks for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, stated in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing trend at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without ever getting to know each other".
Samuel Roberts, 21 and the history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believe that such a climate is "unsatisfactory". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, said that she had observed with JCR members a growing rejection of students of moderate rights.
"This represents a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred for the Conservative party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had voted not to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have scared Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but even took part in it with joy.
Political issues such as the mining strike, the privatization and the rejection of government sanctions against the Apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-capped rooms of the tutorial.
At my first events I had to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been touched on what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now dead), "translate the first paragraph.
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite hateful.
"Do thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students tickled.
I had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take a few French hours in your free time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt told me.
I returned to my room with a hanging head.
This evening I was in college alone at dinner when someone slightly tipped me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year called James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's what it is.
Everyone who is suspected of being Tory is being pressured.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters suggest to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to adjust myself later.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
An early student in philosophy, politics and economics, who ironically visited Eton College, which is considered conservative, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel in front of the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after the darkness broke?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years ahead of me stretched before my spiritual eye into a purgatory of contempt and isolation.
The only tutor who made himself known as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who had his seat in my college.
He was not only hated for being a conservative, but also because he had advised thatcher on foreign policy matters and had written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincially and pettyly and rejected it for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he joined a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started to hang out between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
My father I told him I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
Such a thing they would never do, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends always showed perfect manners.
His wet eyes were drowsy.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just necking.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exploded by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory's followers, had submitted to the pressure and rejected his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, where another historian had claimed seriously that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly ashamed, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brain-wash" and called her "old fool".
The relief took only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, I gave up my pants.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You're welcome to call me a wine-snake.
But no 18 - year - olds should ever suffer from such intimidation and evil.
And it is even more tragic that it was Oxford - a university that produced not only 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but is still hiding behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashionmaker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of Haute Couture have been assembled, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the sticky and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on display until March 3rd, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the finest aristocracy, beginning with the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, and the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England, as well as Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophys of his social ascent from the humble fashionmaker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet.
To be in love with the nobility does not have to be detrimental.
"At least they don't put their hips on your gorgeous carpet, as some beautiful celebrities do from pop music," said Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Nor does the Argentine model Valeria Mazza forget the charism of the fashionmaker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, he recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited felt important and loved," recalls the "Top Model", which began her career at the Haute Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of insinuation, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 60-metre-long walkway, which proposes a role change: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the walkway to admire a dreamlike "audition", the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vatti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names shine like that of Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the museum museums of the designer.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," adds Feria's ex-wife.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion leaders at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came about.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a dropped top with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocracy, which lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashionmaker "with absolute care" "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "king of fashion"
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his neighbors) were necessary to make this ivory-coloured silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroiderys and a four-and-a-half-metre-long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years, Valentino has been in trouble with the "saveur-être" of the elite.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the honors legion, accumulates Garavani as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I always notice his refinement, his quietness, his well-kept and perfect exterior," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him the last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was impeccable; time leaves no traces of him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and their health at stake when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur across the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mineworkers who earn their lives by bringing sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this to happen, he must climb down to the ground of his crater every day, where the sulphur-containing gas flowing from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the abominable paths of stone.
Although it is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, rising to an altitude of 2386 metres, the exhausted wearers need more than 40 minutes for the climb at the tortoise pace, maintaining balance and carefully setting their steps so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocents for each kilo of sulphur they degrade.
At the top, they follow the path between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has been using the deposits in the volcano and (don't say better) its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilo of sulphur.
This is then sold to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"As we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every way," Anto explains, who normally makes three routes a day.
For each route, it takes three hours, after which it is completely done, but at the end of the day, it then brings together 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
But what looks like a miserable wage for such an awfully inhuman effort is threefold of what he would deserve with field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day at the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees ( 167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not as hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs often and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life on the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left the first traces at him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs often and his eyes are irritated due to the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I will work here for another two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
This friendly and intelligent young man, who has been punished by life, could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
It divides a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines in the dark blue.
Challenged by the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlight on his helmet, which he has bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the basket with sulphur on their shoulders at the crater floor.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur reduction to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers that work on their own account and are paid for by weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera, which the guards of this nature park together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) demand from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for the animals and not for the human being," protested Madrusin, a tall, 42-year-old carrier who has been working for three decades since leaving school on the Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as it goes" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes cry, when the wind suddenly turns and the mine workers cling to the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course except for the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and bladders on the shoulders that have distorted themselves from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on its back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg at the age of 53.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano transported by three trucks through a goat path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari 18 kilometres away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth far, missing some teeth.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a sulphur carrier at the age of 30.
Time passes, but poverty continues generation by generation in one of the hardest occupations in the world: those who work as a human burden on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeers are putting the blame for not having children on the career, stress and cost of real estate and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, You are my patriotic wife: We fulfill our civic obligation and we create lives!
It seems unbelievably that the verses are part of an advertising for Minzbons, but nevertheless - or precisely because of that - they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local sayings such as "Schieben will be a "bao" (lab) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The commercial company BBH, which shot the video, preserves the hope that the commercial will reach the problem in a fun way.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfil their "national duty".
This is something for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When we were replanting, we were the worst in the world, so we realized that it was an issue that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfumes with pheromones or organising speed dating nights (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as compose a rap?
1.2 Children
Anyone who does not take this issue easily is the Singapore government.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in the southeast of Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeers have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to get married and make a family to have much more options in terms of life goals and priorities," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to a higher number of single persons and to the delay in marriage and births, the result being a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counter the reduction of the population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely cascaded Xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore government party achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the declining birth rate is known to have an impact on the economic growth of a nation that has tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living space of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the life style of the single person, and that they deter the construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of EL Developers real estate, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out around days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give developers clearer orientations that were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, discussions with Singaporeers working in the financial district can be seen as having no major impact.
"People are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is postponed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"It's important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and costs of ownership and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why Singaporeers have the last word when it comes to having children - the government can still do so much.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private life, or "the area of private life, where you are entitled to protection from any type of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he poses if he makes it known on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the network.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very own" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"I wouldn't make my deepest secrets known in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or of someone who's making the stupid head," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to write obscene photos, of nakeds, of crimes, or insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures him to meet 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I applied to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone is answering me, I'm just charging them up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
Asked he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone were to admit to him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to know 20 people he added to his list of friends.
"This doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy no information has been given to him or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone bothers me or asks me to do it, I'll just remove it from my user account" he admits.
José registered with Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unknown experiences that are known today as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
"He only made it private."
He then explains a series of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he was unkind or I wanted to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a means of searching for information, but with the publication of these pages the rules of the game changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a Master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and adolescents who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we are still learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we demand from them that they have a defined criterion on what is to be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age when maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be selective if it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is is is to ask them questions that make them think.
"They say they shouldn't do it, they won't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you, like the one you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the other people permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone have to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, commented that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you may share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You should not speak to strangers".
Completion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven current rulers.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and President’s Office initially announced that they would pass it on to the Clause, but then explained that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian government’s website.
In the case of questions concerning the text, they stated that the contents of the text were presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, for short explanations.
Journalists' access to information about the Summit was limited at all times.
During the day, in the press room, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted with the announcement "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the governments present at the meeting of unasur, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media discomfort that demanded more information.
After that, the President's Office of Peru sent the media an e-mail containing the "conclusion declaration" of the summit, but it was Humala's statement and not the official document at the end of the summit.
Last October Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced before, was also not published despite the press's urgent invitation.
On the official ASPA website, you can convince yourself that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists were available, but they limited access to information to a large extent.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court resolving a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would adopt the decision of the IGH, which starts in The Hague on Monday, in the process of initiating Lima against Santiago to hear the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we currently present to this International Court of Justice," said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and continues to remain a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and subjugates to international courts," adds Piñera, and greets Humala with a handshake on the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit themselves to the ICC was made after Colombia had made a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake to bring an action against the Bogotá Convention, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
Hosting President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The Head of State left out the closing document, stating that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for a total investment of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He announced that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all regions of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphant steps, but should be used to increase our production performance and to show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects designed to improve the spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-out statement.
These projects would also include five Peruvians who are located on the axis of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are supposed to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve as the basis for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations", which it is currently excluded from.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, before joining the regional meeting, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said that on Saturday in Mexico, he expected a meeting with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, in order to treat the maritime conflict with respect after a judgment of the IGH challenged by Bogotá.
"Perhaps I will meet President Daniel Ortega tomorrow morning (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will examine all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will be as civilized and treated as respectfully as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to attend the new President of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Block's defence ministers also met in advance to adopt the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru chairs the Regional Block Time.
"South America needs to learn to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America actually learning something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, declared to state television in Peru that Europeans were "killed in the Second World War and in other conflicts" and "now are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that would advance the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all the countries of South America, as is already the case in the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that are looking for a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reshaping of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we always sign the South American.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and is funded by the United States," he stated as an allusion to the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at that time there had been "reasoned assumptions that Assange would be delivered to a third country and that his procedure would not be complied with."
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to interview him on his territory for an alleged sexual delicacy, while "Sweden's jurisprudence allowed this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out on Ecuador's Embassy in London."
Correa stated that there would be a danger that the health and mental condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he was in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has an easy problem with the lungs, but not a serious problem," said Ecuador's head of state.
However, there is a danger that he will be able to sew physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a tight space and cannot perform physical outdoor exercises.
"This would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the asylum solution that Assange had been granted since June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London was the granting of a free letter that allowed him to travel to Ecuador, and that it was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a series of proceedings to different European bodies," he said.
And "when the UK grants this letter tomorrow, I think this is done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at Ecuador's Embassy in London or via Skype, as permitted by Swedish case law and in other cases, the problem would be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intent and the lie that deny free expression."
"The biggest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador for no longer being ruled by such journalists "and neither by the bankers nor by hegemonic and spies-bourgeois countries", and anticipated that he would "deep the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction" when re-election.
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain firm and not allow opportunism and no legally disguised coup" because it "destructed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also believes that the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgement of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favoured Nicaragua's maritime state, to negotiate the maritime borders between the two countries with Nicaragua is "absolutely justified."
This judgment is currently not implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the quest for a common path.
They must be fully treated so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also trusted the successful conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call on international bodies if both countries undertake to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard to do so."
With regard to the possibility that he would stand as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured him that if he sold out the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so I must fulfil this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, and then I will withdraw from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a routine and planned treatment and that he would be expected to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a relapse in the health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State attended today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was concluded with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of dying because of AIDS today is a too late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when she was confirmed to be HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb struck," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried "to weaken" without any obvious success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; and this with such commitment that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
At that time AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, there are still many people in the clinic who know nothing about their disease and in whom the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "means the great success today that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information had been based on a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system at the start of treatment, and that those greater chances that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years at a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years at a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that anyone who receives the diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25 can, in this sense, "will easily become 75 years old as long as he is under control," said this expert.
In order to properly order this progress, it must be remembered that today the average life expectancy of Mexicans is 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report), it is nevertheless true that 60 per cent of patients registered in the national database have died since AIDS was published.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by the month of May this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that since 2005 there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
So why are people still dying?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we had no problems with the medication. The problem is that the people come in a very advanced state because they do not know their infection state, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have a accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more early diagnosis is needed, and therefore all persons who need this must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal is endorsed by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by the patients like Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, and for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the caposi sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor) which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, exercise and take the drugs.
Today, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to stimulate with his testimony those who today are afraid of the world AIDS day.
They should test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condom behind the counter
Big holes exist between the health programs and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the issue of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In certain places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk of new infections.
"What do you need this for?" is a widespread mockery question from social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system who do not want to expose themselves to youth, insured the correspondent.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the counter, but in output equipment in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether it would be conservatively distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he pointed out.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is at national level in the 4th place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of infections occur by sex, 6% by blood, and 2% by perinatality.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people for each registered case that do not know.
After the Court of Appeal of the United States has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an ominous precedent is created for every national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws do not apply in the country of the stars and stripes in contradiction to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Court for the northern district of Texas on June 15 leads to Mexican companies being subjected to the seizure of their property beyond the river Bravo without any help.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that creditors must be subject to United States bankruptcy law, the Appeals Court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first states that the main proceedings are commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings for companies with cross-border profiles is not known.
Indeed, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Standardisation of International Trade Law was created, with the American Law Institute being used as a suffocator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the votes of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy stock which the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the required majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstitut für Handelskonkurzes).
It is also correct that, after the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the appellate court.
On the other hand, Vitro owes its difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States that struck the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family objected to the same appeal court so that the vote would take place in plenary, that is, by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not allowed, the Cerciorare appeal, which requires a higher court to review the proceedings, shall in this case be brought by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The gravity of this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figurina amicus curiae (friend of the court), describing the proceedings conducted by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, and pointing out that it had strictly complied with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Double banded carambola: a blow for vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican Air Transport Unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, did not progress for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Association of Pilots' Unions) finally made progress.
The request made by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of impeding the judicial system.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from the Trustee Account F/589 of Bank IXE the name Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used to purchase shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the bourgeois society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has achieved to unite the governors of the South East to resist the monumental institution that partially destroyed protected areas and represented the mother of all industrial threats.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate request to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, although the Senate had ignored the possibility of these measures, they were seen as a violation of the freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex long term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex makes over 500 million pesos certificates available on the market.
The issue is the first of four equal issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Built from NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, the leading information technology companies, a group of companies called Competival was established whose aim is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The World-Bummer of Basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sports for more than 60 years and traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Prior to being tied to the wheelchair by a hit in 2008, Rex was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, proxy and leader at the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"For my life, I have been in basketball for many years, even several at the same time, when I was President of the BSN, Chief Executive Officer of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most, because I was allowed to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as managing director, co-manager or coach.
It was many years of fulfillment, including the five successive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship 1981, the year of the Jerome Mincy debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked as a coach here and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) said: "I have a very strong player and 2 m tall.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had ever had.
Bartov then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another one.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was awarded to him, but already from a distance, because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we took fourth place, what would actually have been bronze if it hadn't been this Canadian referee who made us repeat the final turn for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this World Cup group the best national team you've ever seen in 1990?
She is one of the best, as well as one who won at the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a fight to the US team, like when they won against us at the World Championship Bronze.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (ortiz) again on the team, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was the one of the pre-Olympic tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Houruitiner as a substitute for the locked players due to the incidents at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level like Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys, I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful season of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included BSN from the early 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left of you?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the required trainings and courses for trainers, table officers and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, see videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always with me.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous around the world with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a press release by the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of the birthday celebration.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He made all those who knew him rejoice.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full swing," Gray explained in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman was known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "magnifying Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "Jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also an actor of two comedies that were broadcast only for a short time, such as the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema works included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly abominable J.R. that Hagman made a superstar.
The dramatic series of CBS television series about the Ewing clan and other characters around it was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotion "Who shot J.R.?", which was supposed to create expectation for an episode full of emotions where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were bett in betting houses.
The series thus reached a viewer record in that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who turned "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin who shot J.R.'s sister-in-law (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had let her down and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a despicable businessman and disloyal husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) dismissed.
"I know what to do with J.R.'s gravestone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-actor of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a "extreme personality on and off screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts for those who had the happiness of knowing him and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new issue of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just shot, informed the station.
From Warner or from TNT there was no immediate explanation as to how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatre platforms in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met and married young designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I thought might harm someone or harm him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After liver transplantation, he worked for liver donations and volunteered in a hospital to assist patients with anxiety.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are coming and after," he explained in 1996.
I would like to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but it will go well for you".
He also fought against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of the course studying the "End of the World"
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the "long backwards count" of the Maya calendar on December 21, of which many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon", and a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place where the Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé said this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey.
If anyone analyses what has happened in the world today, as if we had been away for thirty days, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds me that evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world", this semester, which should be the last in history.
In Temple, the associate Professor Barry Beautiful gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, when nuclear material enters the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and investigated how they could compare themselves with real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple name "The End of the World".
"We're not taking up in 2012 so we can always keep the option to keep the course back, in case the world doesn't go down," said Restall.
Despite the "preliminary decline", students have to study, create projects and participate in final examinations.
In Penn State, the final exam is carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than "to continue working until night, where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his high average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if there were still places available.
The students in turn assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a matter of consolation or lack of it.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
"I never heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students interviewed - and less than one professor - said that they believed in the last date of December 21st.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zellen, a student in Temple last year, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Otherwise, people don't think that way," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course there about the "end of the world".
"The Philippines did not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a favor from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken of by the last court and said that when nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period, according to which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they want to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
"Perhaps I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
