Biker reacts quickly and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the road between Kraftolsheim and Merklingen, where a motorcyclist was only slightly injured due to his rapid reaction.
Car driver overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left towards Kraftolsheim with her VW von Merklingen at around 9:30 p.m.
In doing so, she oversaw the 24-year-old motor driver from Nellingen.
At collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, but it was reaching the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the step-by-step procedure, the hand and foot brake levers were torn down at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake off.
From the spiritual point of view, he controlled his motorcycle in the green steps next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffered leg injury
However, due to the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury at the time and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mast infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and must no longer leave the farm.
A security department is monitoring the ban.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positively on the Corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as reported by the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further expansion, we unfortunately need to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the operation - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, which grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beets - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural municipality with about 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
Infected people were separated from non-infected employees on the farm, the area is now surrounded by a fence.
Greens and SPDs gave the government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions called on Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly revenged if such local infectious events are to take place and if regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the Greens' parliamentary director.
This is similar to the SPD: "After the Corona outbreak at the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvesters," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be strictly controlled.
That obviously didn't happen."
The outburst had come "with an announcement".

Report: Seehofer pushes for longer storage data storage
The storage of data is currently suspended.
However, after a media report, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data after a media report - instead of the planned ten weeks half a year.
As the "image on Sunday" reports, Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a quick change of law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore intends to strengthen measures to combat child abuse.
He felt it would be useful "to make the necessary changes to the law now", the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Currently the storage of data is suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected.
However, Seehofer wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, it goes on to say in the report.
A spokesman from the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would only be useful to examine whether legal adjustments were needed if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already called for a storage of data in June.
NBA: Strip club anger for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Arousal in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), a Los Angeles Clippers basketball professional, is said to have left the Disney World tournament quarter in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, however, he also visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is supposed to have admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is again in Isloation, is tested on Covid-19 daily.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these very Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best Wings in the city".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday on Twitter that NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
Thus, the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
The best 22 teams with training games are currently preparing for the season final starting at night on Friday.
South expresses its opinion on the Corona location after mass infection
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a nutrient for large farms.
The press conference will be seen live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the Dingolfing-Landau district has shocked authorities and politics.
At present, nearly 500 harvesters from several countries are working in the large vegetable farm, over a third of them infected with the Corona virus.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed with a fence.
No one is allowed to leave the area, food is delivered.
The local authorities now offer free Corona tests to the 3300 inhabitants.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Land Council Office has so far assumed that the infections did not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience bits": Confession of the Suspected Firefighter of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative," said lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He greatly regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "complained by consciences and taken very seriously by the extent of destruction".
In the event of a conviction, the man, according to the prosecutor's office, will be liable to ten years' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged during a fire the night of Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in three places far apart from each other in the church.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of arson.
The suspect who had now been arrested had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
As there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the eye of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended considering the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the European Commission creates completed facts," said Grindel of the "picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the clubs that can become most dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate does not come around whether it is not appropriate to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations that want to break into this phalanx".
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority stakes that are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to attract investment in a European internal market to the business location of Bundesliga," Grindel said.
The former head of the DFB sees the danger that "the attempts to create more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even equal distribution of TV sets will not achieve a decisive effect.
"The FC Bavaria has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million euros and RB Leipzig of 300 million euros.
So the differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 associations have an average household of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and who have pushed through the press instead of speaking to it," said Grindel about the adoption of an expensive clock that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I've been very busy with this in a humane way."
The gift worth around 11,000 euros he had received from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a breach of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I've been completely transparent and careless.
There were a lot of people in the DFB who knew about it."
He never "made a hooligan out of the gift," the 58-year-old assured him.
"That may be said naively, in any case, this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
"Black Lives Matter": injured and a dead
Protests against police force in the United States have re-emphasized by Donald Trump's deployment of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes in various cities between demonstrators and police officers.
Three people were injured in Louisville, 16 in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by shots while a demonstration train just crossed a cross.
Previously, in Portland, protests against racism and police force had resulted in clashes.
The security forces, including officials from the Federal Police, used tear gas during the night and violently disbanded demonstrators.
Hundreds of armed demonstrators marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday and demanded that those responsible for Breton Taylor's death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student had been shot in March at a drug raid in her home in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who didn't even live there, and no drugs were found either.
When, on Saturday, a member of a group calling itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were hospitalized.
None of them floated in danger of life.
The police set up barricades because area protesters had also formed a white militia.
In the end, there was no meeting of the two groups.
In Austin, a person was shot and died in the course of a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
The police took a suspect in custody, according to their own records.
To date, it did not provide any more details of the circumstances of the case.
Mayor Steve Adler, according to the New York Times, said that he was, like many in the city, "untrodden and unconstitutional" because of what had happened.
Also in the American metropolis Seattle, protesters met with the police on Saturday.
They set fire to a construction car in front of a youth prison, and the police set out to blow grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resistance to police or bodily injury.
In the city of Oakland, California, a court building was set on fire.
A small group of protesters opened windows, fired fireworks and shielded police officers with lasers, the Oakland police reported on the late Saturday evening (local time).
The fire could be quickly removed again.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd that demonstrated on a highway.
As the police reported, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was injured in the hospital.
In addition, windows were also struck there in a court and a fire was laid, as the police reported.
Investigations have been initiated.
Raccozy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sauce in the spa town was missing, visitors and actors enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, actors and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in downtown was missing, the crowds and program highlights like Saale are burning, Rakoczy ball or fixture, many came at their expense with the Corona compliant alternative program.
"I think we've been able to spread Rakoczy flair," says Chief Executive Officer Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have thought it well.
In principle, you go back to the beginnings of the Rakoczy Festival, as well as the historical ones alone were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting the Rakoczy Bad Kissingen festival with her husband for more than 25 years.
So also this time in the Corona year.
The couple made it comfortable at Luitpold-Casino, watching the historians stroll and listening to Cuban live music at the Play Bank restaurant.
"I also find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
They miss the masses that otherwise belong to Rachoczy.
However, you lack the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic festival and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy Reitturner to take place again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant some more work.
About for Christina Gold, who is involved in a normal year on the holiday train and can be seen there on the carriage of the spa garden café.
This year she was walking on foot in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"This is more exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were on their way to the park.
"We very much hope that the riding squad will be able to take place again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break 2021 another Rakaczy riding tournament should take place.
28 Corona traps in Spanish second-class Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football team CF Fuenlabrada is getting deeper and deeper into the crisis because of a Corona outburst.
Since the newcomer from the vicinity of Madrid, despite the first Corona traps flown to the city of A Coruña on July 20th, a crash follows the next one.
Until Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one of them came to the hospital, as the club reported.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south-west of Madrid had so far still had the chance to reach the ascent games.
Now even the descent to the B-group of the Second League threatens.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office determined for a possible crime against public health, the highest sports authority CSD considering the forced descent of the club.
Players as well as other team members sit in a hotel in quarantine.
"Until the sixth day of the quarantine, they have received no fresh towel and no gel," wrote the sports magazine "AS".
On photos you can see how players hung up underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
Also, the bedding had not been changed for five days.
Another problem is eating.
Neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
On the other hand, the club management told us that you were satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation of intentionally endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer Javier Tebas Llanas.
The son of Primera Division president Javier Tebas, as reported by the Europa Press news agency and the sports magazine "Marca", had not been violated by the Corona rules established by the football association.
Before the departure there were four infected persons until 19 July, but all of them were isolated and had not gone along.
Right before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members had been re-tested.
When the team was already in A Coruña, further team members of the Corona test had been positive for "five or six".
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the call, said Tebas Llanas.

After the officers gained the confidence of the horses shortly before steaming, they were able to get around a rope carried in the tramcar.
Radprofi Tony Martin: Career-continueable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin thinks about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm currently working with the team on the basics of how and in what form it could go on," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
During the negotiations with his team it is also the number of days of racing, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Earlier he had risen after a fall, and the first thought had been: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today I think as a father of a little daughter: what if".

"But I did well to see from Corona's time what I have in cycling and how much fun he's doing to me."
At the Tour de l'Ain (August 5 to 9,), the time trial specialist enters the competition again.

"A high-ranking opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing you again with Niko Kovac," said Eintracht-Trainer Adi Hütter.

700 dead by monsoon rain in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people died because of the strong monsoon rain.
In Bangladesh, the Red Hemisphere in boats strives to reach isolated people.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers lost their crops.
Panzershorns in National Park die by landslide
In the Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 Panzerna horns died by landslides.
They are protected and considered to be at risk of extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which brings knowledge to back climate change.
Bangladesh, according to the United Nations, is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the village of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm is also being held in Grenezn.
Whoever had a house before, it was also so small and like a hut, often does not want to spend his life in a large residential block.
Many apartments are empty, but - as the government wants - should soon be referred to those who have lost their house by the floods.

Argentina rejects counteroffer of creditors
The new claims could not be met, said the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, it would also be unfair," he said in an opinion.
"While 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under the current conditions.
That is why Argentina calls on its private creditors to refrain from some of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country again threatens the state's plea.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Finally, the lenders had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
The Argentine Government, however, adheres to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was last more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by around 10 percent.
At the end of May Argentina had not paid interest receivables of US$503 million and was therefore in a limited default.
Professionally arrived - private not yet
"It's going super good" - this conclusion is drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very fast: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden Notariatsstelle.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the PhD lawyer took up the work, the normal daily business has been running long on full tours.
"I still have to arrive in private," she explains in conversation with the Rottal indicator and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely shift the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
She is currently working with her husband, who is a judge at the Landgericht in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave in the short term to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to hang out every day from Regensburg, they have a possibility of staying with their parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighboring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been a term for you.
On-site visits with her family in recent months, she has stated again: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
All the more so, she was pleased that she had made the race in the competition for the spot.
Her home country, Lower Bavaria, also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career.After her law degree in Passau, she completed her referendum period and the 2nd state degree in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notarassessorin, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu as well as Regensburg - at this time she also "besides" the promotion in labour law - she took her first place in 2012 as a notarin in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
In 2016, she went to parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has served as a representative in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden had been declared due to Lutz Feller’s close retirement, it had seen the right time for full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the office of holiday representative in the future, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and immediately has a praise for the firm's team: "It's running super good!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
She has already contacted a local institution in the field of kindergarten and cribs.
And everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks of the Rottal.
BVB plans to launch with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will be filled for the start of the season in case of a fan return not even 20 percent.
"As a result of the distance regulation, which must be complied with, we are planning to have 12,000 to 15,000 viewers at the present time," said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer to the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt at Bundesliga games has a little more than 81,000 spectators.
In the ghost games of the last season caused by the Corona pandemic, the BVB had lost about four million euros per lot.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at the BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal seats, some of the 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues are completely broken".
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, all were "well advised to take a stable side-length first".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short jobs alone in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chief praised the BVB professionals for their salary waiver, which is supposed to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandise on short jobs."
Winty Miracles: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a Packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his whole body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 breakfasts that are cared for at the children's hospital in Graz every year.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - such as Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lung, nor intestine, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear dolls' clothes and mini-windles specially made for them.
But not so small that they would not be with voice - "and like," Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if of course they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the whiteboard gets to the stage
Despite Corona Theatre in the Classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th class of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the students by video.
After that, the students were able to exchange the piece and the performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of the lesson.
Although at the end all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage rooms would offer additional charm, the theatre also sees the potential for contact with schools.
"If we further improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round out: The TSV 1860 would meet in the DFB Cup at Eintracht Frankfurt
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the lions will meet in Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup are fixed.
The lions would meet in Eintracht Frankfurt with a successful qualification.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening at the ARD sports show.

Due to the voluntary waiver of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, the TSV in 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4th or 5th September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If Zweitliga-Aufstehen Würzburg reached the final, Sixty would already be qualified for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesingers would have to prevail against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg in the final game.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between 11th and 14th September and will take place one week before the Third League start.

De Havilland was well known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the southern part of the "Wide Wound" (1939).
As a child of British parents born in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a minor.
The Austrian theatreman Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Shakespeare's "Summer Night Dream".
The film studio Warner Brothers signed it for seven years and brought it out on the side of Eroll Flynn.
Eight films she shot with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the main role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mother Heart".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiresse" (Die Erbin).
A lot of recognition was given to her as a neurotic eccentricist in "Der dunder Spiegel" and "Die Schlangngrube".
Daphne du Maurier proposed it in 1952 for the main role in the filming of her novel "My Cousine Rachel".
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her long-time friend Bette Davis, she played in "Wing song for a body".
The son of Benjamin emerged from the marriage of Marcus Goodrich (1946-1953).
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage broke out, too.
However, rumours about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finals at Comeback
The two World Championships, Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler, missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they signed their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Fluggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Last time, Tole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the final game on the Rhine, their Ehlers/Flüggens defeated the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: the tickets secured Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz cast from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fibre leaf"
From the point of view of the FDP, the exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fibre sheet" and does not alter the character of the party.
"The AfD is the extreme right-wing parliamentary arm in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said the FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser of the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiations, which the Federal Board of Directors had decided to do in May.
Kalbitz is the chairman of the AfD Group in Brandenburg Landtag.
"If the AfD really were to be involved in consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his followers would have long been excluded," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and changes nothing," he said to the "World on Sunday".
"It speaks rather volumes, how many frenetic supporters still have a right extremity in the middle of the AfD."
Blume expects the AfD to land below five percent in future in elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "Volgels" around the Thuringian AfD-Landes- und Groepsführer Björn Höcke; the protection of the Constitution constitutes a "secured right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD head of state had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had a previous membership at his party entrance in the now banned extreme right-wing "Heimattrehen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and did not specify with the Republicans.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
Sebastian Walter, Chairman of the Left Group at Brandenburg Landtag, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Court of Arbitration does not alter the character of the AFD: "The wolf only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a right-wing extreme party, whether with or without calbitz".
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The manoeuvring of the Meuthen force is transparent.
One wants to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and tries to get under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not release the spirits that called it.
There is nothing to change a draft," commented the Brandenburger SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here, the AfD-Landesverband and the Group kept their right-wing leader until today."
The legal debate on the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
Nordsee wind farms deliver good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind turbines on the German North Sea fed 11,51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid.
This is 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet reported in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea current to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
Wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network area, have fed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind current from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea thus reaches 13,73 TWh, compared with 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The windfall at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is in addition to the wind conditions resulting from higher production capacities, as new wind farms have joined the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were to run at the same time with full force, they could produce 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it will rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, until then, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce around 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This would allow nearly seven million households to be supplied with electricity.
Kunst "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a small anniversary celebration to 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold gave the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
The club "Sandtogether" was engaged north of the gallery.
Freital: Windbergfest canceled for Corona
The Windbergfest does not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival scheduled for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - aware of how difficult it is for the parties involved - hoped for until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partyless).
"But in the end, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here."
If tens of thousands had flowed to the fixed site and to the fixed tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and follow-up of contacts could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by a number of times.
Rumberg was in the mood for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7th to 9th May 2021 and the Day of Saxony from 10th to 12th September 2021.
Dressage-Olympia winner Werth not to hit the lead
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic winner Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories at four starts at the weekend.
After having won a Grand Prix for the start of the season with Weihegold and Quanaz, she was also at the Grand Prix Special on Sunday and not to be beat in the choir.
On Sunday at the 15-year-old Mute Weihegold, Werth was in a special position clearly against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
On Saturday, the Germans were also clearly on Quantum before their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantum belongs to Max-Theurer.
The world's most successful dressage rider is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quanaz, it was the first hour ever.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all four important exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for 14-16 August.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The Worms University continues in the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" provides a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and starts 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to allow the start of the studies not only in summer but also for the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained.
At the same time, the capacities at both the University and the DFS Aviation Safety Academy will be equally exploited.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in Air Traffic Management as part of their training in air traffic control at the Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students already started this year.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the piloting profession.
"At these times, we do not find the promotion economically easy.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS when signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation Professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-cutting knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue good cooperation with the university and at the same time strengthen our attractiveness as an employer".
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: "The foundation professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it we want to link to the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's degree program Air Traffic Management".
German Air Safety's trust in the University of Worms is both a motivation and a commitment to further develop its teaching and research skills in the future fields of aviation.
With the first professorship of the foundation, the university can place very special highlights and innovative emphasis on its students for a dual course of studies in the field of air traffic control tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, stresses: "The Worms University has a unique feature in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signature of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter ends up on the A 45
Around 30 minutes the A45 motorway was fully blocked on Saturday morning towards Aschaffenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopter was in operation.
A 76-year-old went straight with a Ford at around 12.40 in the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the curve and landed on the main course.
Due to the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered slight injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The 72-year-old passenger's injuries were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient then flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, where a damage of about EUR 2000 was incurred, had to be towed off.
Heil wants to examine other sectors of the meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Law-enforcement is imminent.
But are they right - and will it remain?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors according to the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for the industry and then take appropriate action for the industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer already warns against restricting employment contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel when slaughtering, cutting and processing meat.
To this end, employment contracts and temporary workers should be prohibited.
employer president Ingo Kramer said to the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of employment contracts and employee transfer, if you do not want to completely dissipate the economy".
Work contracts are, for example, the basis for their added value to customers for large areas of craft, construction and plant construction.
"The mistakes Individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil insured: "My aim is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts were useful.
"If an industrial company orders a craftsman to install a safety facility, this is a normal work contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on labour contracts and temporary agency work to be unconstitutional in its own sector.
It is not clear why, in future, other labour law should apply to the serving and packaging of cheese than to sausages, it is stated in an opinion on the bill, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the case of a ban, therefore, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from contract companies worked in the industry, after the results of an examination of the NRW occupational safety management, for some 16 hours a day.
Often they did not have a break.
Wages have been retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "trick constructions".
"Now needs to be thoroughly cleaned up".
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to adopt in the Cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures which do not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher labour protection inspection rates or clear criteria for community housing".
This draft includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and to the Law on Labour Protection.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport," said Nonnemacher at the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg at the moment".
However, more staff are also needed for more controls.
Three dead when ultralight aircraft crashed in Germany
When an ultralight aircraft crashed to a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died according to police reports.
A child had been easily injured.
Two more people had been injured in the accident, said a spokesman of the Wesel District Councillor.
A parachute had been found at the scene, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, calling on eye-witnesses, that before the crash the aircraft had collided with a hot air balloon.
At the house it is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Space of Frankfurt Opera peacefully run out
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the room of the Opera Square in the night on Sunday also took place peacefully.
Last, a few dozen people stayed in the square, but left him at 1 a.m. before the end of the lock.
The police had been in service since early evening with a large number of officials, and a larger number of police officers were on duty throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a ban on seduction for the opera, on which it had come to Krawallen a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked out of the crowd with bottles.
At least five officials were injured after police reports, several police vehicles damaged.
The night to Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car overrun: Young woman seriously injured on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In the event of an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday around 1.25 pm.
She was taken to Kassel Hospital.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade was looking for potential co-drivers.
According to the police on Bundesstraße 83, the woman was on her way to her place of residence in Hümme, when her car left from the road because of previously unclear reasons and was repeatedly overrun.
In order to save the injured, the fire brigade had to open the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear if anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched by the rotary conductor with a thermal imaging camera.
The Drohnenstaffel from Warburg, which also works with thermal cameras, had also been ordered for the search for persons.
However, the forces found no one between the high corn plants.
The seriously injured person was taken to the Kassel Klinikum with the rescue car for further care.
Almost 50 firefighters Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was locked for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a saving goal of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team of the five-time world football player made the 36th overall Scudetto of the club history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before the half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which came without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer out of place two days before the end of the season of Series A.
The second Inter Milan table is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a free shot variant.
An addition of Miralem Pjanic directly exploited the 35-year-old from the penalty limit with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved in 2:0 against the now more offensive guests, after his shooting Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted.
This ensured the glareless but decisive success.
In the 89th minute, only Ronaldo himself, looking at the goal hunter rating, would have been right.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the spiritual exhaustion of his players was great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end Juve had the advantage of calming down at the top of the table due, last but not least, to the weakness of the competitors.
In the 11 games before the match on Sunday, the Sarri team had only succeeded five victories.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo will be a goalie.
While the Portuguese superstar had so far scored 31 goals, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already 34 hits on his account at the Hellas Verona, after his three-pack at the 5:1 (1:1) table-backed Lazio Rome – as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to FC Bayern's winning title.
The current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentinean won 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Alte Dame" of Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus is on the eighth final of the Champions League, but on August 7th, Juventus will have to compete against Olympique Lyon for a 0:1 match to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite the many illegal racing races on Baden-Württemberg roads, the penalties and court decisions threatened all continue to give gas: In the last year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal car races in the southwest.
Although there are no comparative values for the years before, the lawns are increasingly doing work for the judicial authorities: A total of 155 investigations were conducted in 2018 between the prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim, one year later there were 252 and already 151 in the current year until the beginning of June.
The race involved less organised events, as the Ministry of the Interior's response to a request from the Landtags-SPD emerges.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously attacked each other or they would have taken the flight from the police - this is also indicated as illegal racing.
At the tax, mainly German men were between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 Penalties - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases will the lawns be caught and also asked to cash out: According to the Ministry of the Interior, 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 sentences have been imposed.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races actually rises.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of a number of tragic accidents and processes over the past years and pointed out more frequently, said a ministry speaker.
At Rasern, especially popular is the motorway 8. Again and again, motorists stop traffic there in order to get space and take advantage of the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, and three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular racetrack
On the A81, the police even recorded more races than on any other federal highway.
A speed limit is used to stop the lawns on the particularly affected section between narrows and hostages.
The most high-priced and worn-out sports and luxury bodies often have Swiss characteristics, because the drivers avoid lawn to Germany due to the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few distances: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD Landtag Group.
"The barrier threshold for lawns would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel here and there legally with 200 kilometres per hour and more".
Rivoir has less to do with enlightenment or image campaigns: "He who goes beyond all the rules in such a way and not only puts his own life at stake, but also the life of other road users, is hardly reachable with reason".
ADAC calls for greater police penetration
On the other hand, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser will not be deterred from the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Division Manager for Transport and the Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and more stringent checks on the routes concerned.
Not rarely is the most painful and severe serious event of the high-tourist forces: Since January 2019 and until April 2020 three people died at the races throughout the country, two of them uninvolved during a night crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are supposed to have played a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, fought against a garden wall and remained on the side, which died 18-year-old passenger.
21 more people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
However, sharper penalties are not necessary, according to Minister of the Interior Thomas Strobl: "We do not see any need for legal action to sanction illegal motor racing harder," says the Ministry of the Interior's paper.
Blue light of July 23: Boring burglar steals drinks from snack
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Kreis Calw) and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 pm and ran towards the Imbisse.
There he noticed a man who was serving himself at the fridge with drinks and left the snack at the end of a door that had been opened before.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash box and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hooded sweater, black pants and bright shoes.
Other evidence is received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to win the final stage at Sibiu Tour
On the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour, Radprofi Pascal Ackermann fought his second day session.
The 26-year-old Palatinate from the Bora-hansgrohe team was in mass sprint on the 109-kilometre section with its start and finish in Hermannstadt after winning a stage on Saturday.
It was the season's winners three and four for Ackermann.
His Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger continued in the overall ranking.
The 26-year-old had decided to drive the mountain time for himself in the morning and thus took the lead in the classification.
Only 104 riders had come to the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time.
"I'm really happy to start the season restart with a win," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
He simply put on his sprint 300 meters before the finish, "and it also worked perfectly".
According to the rules of the UCI, a Corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race for all participants and their companions.
During the complete tour, riders and carers were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Visitors to the start and finish were not allowed.
The office gave instructions on lay-resuscitation
Düsseldorf - Tragical accident on Sunday morning in Düsseldorf-Garath.
A child (4) was suddenly living in the water while swimming in a multifamily house.
According to the fire department, the emergency call went in just before 1 p.m.
"A focal point dispatcher immediately gave instructions on lay reanimation," said a fireman to BILD.
The rescue forces arrived shortly afterwards to take the resurgence measures.
The child at risk of life was transported to the Uniclinic under reanimation.
Why it failed is unclear.
The police have routinely taken up investigations into the accident.
The firefighter: "We leave from a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on the parking lot of a furniture house on Saturday night.
The police turned their announcement to control such events more closely.
A big Tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberger Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central French police, an increase in the number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstadter Straße was recorded at around 10.30 p.m. by the Nuremberg Transport Police.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks.
Only recently had the police announced that they wanted to step up the fight against so-called autoposses.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials counted at the top 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police balance.
However, only a small part of the participants in the "autoposer" and tuning scene should be assigned to this.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene responded to the police appeal.
On the basis of the local vehicles and persons, it was assumed that the majority of these were scavengers.
In addition, the majority of respondents were in compliance with the current protection regulations, in particular with the minimum distance and wearing a mouth-nasal protection.
The on-the-spot checks were completed at around 1 p.m.
In total, the officials of 10 vehicles found such structural changes that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
There was no illegal car racing.
"The Police Bureau of Central France will continue to keep an eye on the situation and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the emergence of scavengers," it said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger about the involved towing company: "They all have beautiful rims that we must not scratch," says Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company had to be careful not to cause damage.
"After all, young people are supposed to keep their cars safe."
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-term work
Berlin - According to the Federal Labour Agency (BA), around 900 cases of suspected abuse of short-time workers' money are being investigated.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have shown short work," said Daniel Terzenbach, Executive Director of the operating business of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, many companies suddenly asked for short work, BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the test lasted up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
More precisely, we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there's still a lot to do.
We are not naive there and have a long breath".
Mention of abuse is often made by the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, use the BA analysis software to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvency threshold in autumn.
"Will there be much more insolvency than in the previous year?
The assessments are different, but we are arming ourselves in the case of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency pay".
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: New Garden Party disbanded
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection had been dissolved by the district drivers of the Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Garten (SPSG) at 2048 hours, on request of PNN.
The young people would have left the park.
On Saturday evening some young people would have played in the New Garden Rugby.
The meadow had been cleared by residents, SPSG speaker Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
Always comes to illegal celebrations in the parks
In the Foundation's parks there are always collections where the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 bypass regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June there had been a celebration with about 300 people at Park Babelsberg, and one week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a Corona regulation, the parks are closed when the darkness breaks.
The storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the parking regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time about visitors leaving more and more garbage and destroying protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have meanwhile reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal Techno party on Sunday.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona eruption in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austria tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the national authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still out in the evening.
As a result, many of the infected young interns are in tourism businesses, but at least one holiday guest has been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday evenings.
The lock was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" said the head of the Wolfgangsee tourism association, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Individual guests also had to leave early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 nights spent last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections had become public.
Alois Lanz, Head of District Authority, defended on Saturday the behaviour of interns who had celebrated in several places and who could have been infected there.
"We all liked to do this in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of Covid-19.
Hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested on Saturday.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July onwards were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of Corona spread throughout Europe during the initial phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main areas of focus in the new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea Qualifies for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place on the last match day of the Premier League by a 2:0 (0:0) victory against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes must now be satisfied with the Europa League because the FC Chelsea passed by and qualified as fourth also for the royal class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United was led by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the playtime, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) reached the end.
Chelsea, in the Champions League finale opponent of FC Bayern, won the Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0).
"This means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as Chelsea coach also stands in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's win against Wolverhampton, which passed the Wolves at Crystal Palace with a low 1:1 (1:0) and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided to play with the Watford FC and the Bournemouth AFC for a long time at West Ham United.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84.) immediately matched Andrej Jarmolenko (85.).
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, descends after five First League years.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) FC Everton.
In the end, a point was missing.
The FC Liverpool, which has been held as an English champion since the end of June, secured a record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team just missed the record in English football.
Manchester City holds 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute Virgil van Dijk (38th), Dicock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torschütze van Dijk after the game, "this should encourage us to defend the title.
It becomes difficult".
At the end of the day, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Due to the Coronavirus crisis, the football business in England had been interrupted from March 13th to June 17th.
In the meantime, even a premature break-out or an extension of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
In the end, however, the season could be played without special occurrences - however, as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
Israel's protests against Netanyahu's head of government are becoming increasingly violent.
In the night there have been violent clashes.
The Israeli police were violently protested at protesters in Jerusalem on the night of Sunday against the Conservative government leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people had been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told us.
The police, among other things, used waterthrowers to dissolve the rally.
On Saturday evening, according to media reports, some 6000 people gathered near Netanjahu's headquarters.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahus handling the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew up in horns, and called Netanyahu to resign.
Participants from an area demonstration who supported Netanyahu had also been arrested, reported the news page "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including the private villa of the head of government in the coastal town of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police reports near Tel Aviv because he was suspected to have sprayed pepper spray from a driving car on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a mass attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester had been slightly injured on his neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The demonstrations accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu was most recently criticized for handling the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is expected to have rapid relaxations and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has severely affected the country's economy.
The last unemployment rate was more than 20 per cent.
The number of new infections with the Corona virus in Israel recently increased to ever new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter force on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A ride accident claimed nine light injuries on Saturday afternoon at the B58 near Ahlen.
A driver was driving with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police: "Probably she had stopped suddenly because she wanted to turn off."
This must have been seen too late by the driver of a Mercedes transporter who was driving behind her.
He pushed the back of the car on it.
In the accident three passengers were slightly injured in the car and six in the transporter.
Several rescue cars took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea closes border city to Corona suspected case
To date, North Korea has seen its own measures to counter the Corona virus as a "lightening success".
Now the country is reporting for the first time on a suspect case.
Due to the first official case of Corona in the country, North Korea has shut down a big city for fear of a disaster.
Despite the most stringent epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong the emergency had been imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
According to its own data, North Korea had not registered a single infection and described its defence measures as "lighting success".
The data were doubted abroad.
According to the reports, the symptoms of the disease were detected in a "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person moved to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was no confirmation at first of the crossing within four kilometres of the military buffer zone, which was largely still mined, from South Korea.
However, according to reports by the Yonhap National News Agency, the South Korean military granted the possibility of illegal border crossings to North Korea as high.
Investigations were conducted into some individuals.
According to North Korea's own reports, an emergency meeting of the workers' party's Politburo under the chairmanship of ruling Kim Jong Un was called on Saturday because of the suspicion.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure, "to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others", it continued.
The data subject and all the people in Kaesong who had contact with her were placed under quarantine.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is therefore to investigate the "outbreak" and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose a severe penalty.
According to estimates, around 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension before the Council: City-Ost and noise protection are still waiting for a big summer break to discuss
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the Committee will also vote on the building plan for the major urban development-east project", it is said at the middle of the urban press release at the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of Congress Centre Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city will, however, be discussed in controversy until the end.
The majority of these are scarce, most recently in individual committees, depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT) to let out of citizenship and then developed by the administration and municipal council not now fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "non-parliamentary opposition", "unfortunate", "speculation", "pollution" and "conscious false statements".
"All think they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the Municipal Council for the past year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he was in this position: "I know what I am talking about".
The exit is cheaper for the city, the technical town hall is opposed to statements by the city administration after subsidies, whose existence is convinced Klein to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than predicted in the town hall and on the part of the supporters of the economy.
The city by its own power and not to shape an investor: this is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides for the renovation of the Technical City Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the ex-thale for administrative areas and a more small-scale urban transformation ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
Environmental issues in particular will also play a central role.
For example, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health pollution caused by road traffic, including many temporary reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting the regular bus service with thinned bars and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also approves the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda for accession to the Climate Change Pact of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishing of parental contributions in urban day care facilities and the application for admission to federal Smart City funding are on the agenda.
Citizens are welcome, but Corona's protection measures must be respected.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his first season at the ADAC GT Masters on July 31st.
Before the league of the super sports cars was able to take on regular operation, the first test runs were on.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking on his first mission to the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargen turned his first laps on the Lausitz ring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the Porsche from the preseason," Zimmermann says.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really did have a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Dutchman is already experienced in GT sports in spite of his only 25 years and was able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand blindingly and we have also made tremendous progress from session to session on the Lausitzring".
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also perform its first race.
From July 31 the 33 super sports cars will run through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, one of the 15 new series, knows the route.
In 2015, he was the last guest in the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the track a little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you need to meet optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann is then really, it turns out in two weeks.
"The teams poker a little, of course, in the tests," he says.
"Finally, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a dense calendar.
There will be seven races until the beginning of November.
The current state is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula 1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will take over the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister of Transport of the Quarantine Decision cold caught
According to press reports, the decision of the British government to place Spain holidaymakers under quarantine for two weeks after their return, has caught the country's transport minister cold.
Grant Shapes is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues at home on Saturday decided to take the action.
Due to the rising Corona numbers in Spain, the London Cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which it is possible to enter without quarantine requirements.
The new rule will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to return to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are only on the day of departure, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, has so far been considered one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour Member Diane Abbot.
"But apparently nobody's bothered to tell Grant Shapes."
Just one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the end of the severe lockout, the infection rates in the country rise again.
Virologists are primarily responsible for the new spread of night life.
Spain is one of the British's most popular holiday countries.
From unnecessary travel to mainland Spain, the British government is currently advising, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel Corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin announces hypersound weapons for warships
Russia's President Vladimir Putin announced on the Navy's day in his country that the warships will be equipped with the most modern hyper-sounding weapons.
With these weapons unique in the world, the fighting possibilities of the Russian maritime forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central marine parade.
According to Interfax, the Ministry of Defence also informed the agency about successful tests of the marine-built hypersound rocket zirkon.
The hypersound weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater Tropedeo to be built
It was also built on the atomic-expendable underwater torpedo Poseidon, it was called.
The planned sea urchins are planned to destroy coastal targets.
The President, who was also on a military boat himself, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be served by the individual fleet associations of the largest country on earth.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years the Marine Russia has been reliably protecting, Putin said at the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
On many other Russian coastal norths, the naval forces also began the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting side by side with the powerful Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a gun show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
There, ammunition was fired.
In a video published by the Ministry of Defence, there were not only warships, including a submarine, but also fighter helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" Reaches Texas: Help Difficult Because of Corona
Washington - This year's first hurricane over the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rainfalls now threatened parts of the U.S. state, reported the National Hurricane Center to the US Climate Authority NOAA at night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called the emergency for many districts.
The Texas-based Corona pandemic made the work of the helpers difficult," said Abbott according to US media.
Evacuated called to caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
In view of Texas’s whirlwind, he added: “This challenge is complicated and will be exacerbated even further, considering that it is swept through an area which is the most affected area of the state of Covid-19”.
According to Johns Hopkins University, as a result of the Corona pandemic, some 5,000 people have died alone in Texas.
Abbott called people who had to leave their homes with caution.
You should not ignore practices "to which we have become accustomed", such as wearing masks, said the governor according to the station CBS.
It was important that everyone kept a distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, tests should be carried out on Corona in emergency accommodation.
Damage had initially been reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
At speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour "Hanna" according to authorities on Padre Island was hit directly off the Texan coast on land.
The tropical storm had previously been elevated to a hurricane of the lowest level.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was first issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" continued to move inland and contributed to the north-east of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was on the way to Hawaii at night on Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometres per hour.
The Hurricane Center, however, expected it to further weaken.
According to the forecast, on Sunday (local time) he is supposed to be near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, following a May forecast, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected to become up to six very strong hurricanes, the Authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes over the Atlantic every year, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, an average of only 10 percent.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government was watching the storms closely and in contact with the affected states.
Four gates granted: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuric were granted two goals
Naples - Four goals achieved, four goals recognized: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a black evening at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league series A - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival not given goals for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard on a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples had headed through a gate of outdoor defenseman Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuric initially praised the compensation.
The video assistant referee (VAR) took the hit back because of an out position.
Five minutes later, Djuric shot the ball again into the net - the VAR resumed.
The gates of attacker Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) also took back the referee team, according to the VAR.
In the replay period, Allan made the 2:0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology provides records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winner FC Bayern.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick recovers "in a way" he must think about how he can rebuild his successful defense even after the first team training after the injury of World Champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who, behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Central Field Manager Joshua Kimmich, has shown the most important minutes of action, suffered a band injury on the left foot root and threatened to be missing in decisive royal-class duels.
In Munich's muddled weather, the right-wing defenseman broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf card.
How long the unqualified stock player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A match against Chelsea on August 8 in the 8th Final is likely to be difficult, and the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting in Lisbon on August 12.
The Bavarias do not want to be stopped by the misguided training on Sunday.
Flick called in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration should show his victorious title collectors in the 28 days that follow ideally until the end of the royal class game on August 23.
"We just mastered the duties with championship and cup.
Now it's time to create the special thing," Flick said.
Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve in concrete terms, however, the eighth final is against Chelsea FC.
After the 3–0 game in front of the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena were not supposed to become a Bayern nightmare like in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game," Flick demanded.
A vote test is taking place on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars after the double 13 day vacation on a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players for the noble purchase Leroy Sané, who first met all the new colleagues in the place after his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy has joined well like all the new ones," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. can no longer compete, Flick talked much more about the current title project of the German Series Champion.
After days of single-group and small-group training, the Londoners are now trained in team strength, which are in contrast to the Flick ensemble in the game rhythm.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, while Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are potential opponents in the semifinals.
A path to the finale in Lisbon "is not so easy," the head coach stressed, who from Tuesday can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in the training.
The World Cup recorders Klose and Flick know from so many common tournament preparation, which is particularly important when it comes to 0-to-100 agreement.
With his current team the work was "a pleasure", praised Flick.
The "focus on winning" was an impressive feature of his team.
At the tournament with nine teams it was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the service providers were present, including the migrating Thiago and defenseman David Alaba, whose stay beyond the royal season is not guaranteed.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to cut its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise in order to award the World Cup title.
All American races were cancelled.
The race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more races were added to the ten previously confirmed Grand Prix during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring will be driven in Germany and the Portuguese Portimão.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. fought for World Championships on the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
The 2020 race calendar thus includes 13 races according to the current level.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in the completion of our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1 Boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the Royal Motorsports class are expected to take place in this extraordinary season.
Finally, Formula 1 wants to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Media reports indicate that before the official races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, there could still be performances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulation requires racing on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require, however, at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even though only two continents are being driven, as is currently planned, there is a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the titles by calling for "extraordinary circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional season start in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the start of the Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Absage in Brazil meets criticism
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We are looking forward to seeing them again next season," Carey said.
The cancellation of the American races was particularly critical in Brazil: "The cancellation was not surprising for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for this," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, infection rates in the area of São Paulo were significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Furthermore, the concerns of some teams not wanting to go to Brazil would not justify rejection.
It was prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad look at Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg talked about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in Stephen Colbert's well-known latency show and told the interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Klimatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US-Latenight show via video channel.
She told about her fight against the powerful in the world, among other things.
She also spoke about her famous "bad eyes" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latency show about her plans in the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Lassenight-Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful in the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she shook.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children are going on the road," she experienced.
Head of State and leading politicians, who mocked them in social media or even tried to silence them, find them "delightful" because the reactions show them "because they have no other answer to it".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a famous scene in which she took a bitter look after US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the actvisor sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip produced a GIF, i.e. an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think of the US President at that moment?
Stephen Colbert's relatively open question was only answered un dry in a short time: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirician Colbert probably had not counted with the ready-made answer and briefly disappeared laughing from the picture.
With her "How do you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she remembered many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race around Europe's Golden Shoes with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has further the best chances to become goaltender king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB-profie contributed three hits at the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, among which two converted eleven meters into replay times of both halves.
As a result, the 30-year-old of the fourth season game has now 34 seasonal gates on his account before the end - as many as Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern München scored in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo is following with so far 30 gates, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster: after a fast ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply down and then slowly up again.
Now the bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He had died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73 years, family members announced in an official statement on Saturday, a further opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the Band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the legendary band since 1967 in London, until today its dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there should have been disputes because Green wanted to donate all the Group's profits for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide garments and with a large cruzifix.
Psychological problems should also have played a role.
Green left the band in 1970 three years after it was founded.
There was a social decline.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
Green was treated in psychiatry for a long time.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the picture.
He is said to have lived on the street temporarily, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a while in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
He has been enthusiastic about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters in his early years.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teen started to play professional guitar and was given five years later the chance to be a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
He was later hired by the Bluesbreakers as a substitute for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the band the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid ascent soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not force the media drum, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly able to achieve a respectable success with an album inspired by religious themes in 1979.
Fleetwood Mac, however, swim without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not succeed in a bigger comeback until he started again with a group of friends of musicians in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke of a rock star returning to Earth at that time.
Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band broke up in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blues legend in life - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
