Members of the Wales Parliament are afraid to look stupid
Some members of the delegation have been confused by the proposal that their title should be changed to the MWP, the Member of the Welsh Parliament.
Mr Kohu started with the plan to change the name of the representative to the Wales Parliament.
The members of the Bureau are concerned, regardless of the party's position, that change can make them a mockery.
According to one of the Labour Party representatives, the group is concerned that the name "cross-word with Twp and Pwp."
To readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means stupidity and pwp means pwp.
According to one Plaid representative, the majority of the group 'is not satisfied' and has proposed other options.
According to the Conservative party's representative, his group is 'open' to the name change, but points out that the word MWP is a short word for stupidity.
In Wales, the W-letter is expressed in this context in the same way as in the York U-letter.
The Commission, which is currently preparing the necessary legislative amendment to the name change, stated: 'The final decision on the names of the members of the representative is, of course, for the members themselves.'
The Wales Administration Act of 2017 empowers the representative to change his name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion on the proposals, according to which the appointment of a representative to the Wales Parliament would benefit from broad support.
While the Commission favours Members of the Parliament of Wales or the WMP reduction, the MWP option received the most support in the public debate.
The members of the delegation seem to be proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus may lead to the leading President, Elin Jones, who is expected to change the legislative proposal within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also includes other amendments relating to the functioning of the representative, such as the loss of the representative's mandate and the rules on the format of the committee system.
When dealing with legislation, members of the delegation may give their final vote on the title they should be invited to use.
Macedonians go to the electoral district in a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether the name of the country will be changed to "North Macedonia".
The referendum is aimed at resolving the decades-long dispute with Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has for a long time reiterated the fact that the northern neighbour's name is in practice a regional requirement for its territory and has repeatedly opposed its efforts to join the EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum, has said that he would ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, reason that the change in name is simply the price of membership of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martins are quiet as the churches of Harlem live hard times
"The elderly people I've been talking to say there was a bar or a church before on every corner of the street," says Adams.
"There's neither of them."
He said that losing the bars is understandable.
He said, "There has been a change in the way people interact."
"The bears are no longer the common living rooms of the neighborhood where people meet regularly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not stand as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the exit box."
He added that churches can be replaced by houses and apartments that people inhabit are not the ones that would support the shrines left behind the neighborhood.
"There will be no more people who buy apartments from these buildings," he says, "and thus they will have to take the day when these churches will shut their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these homes will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by the white congregations before Harlem became a black-collar community in 1870 and St. Martins decade later.
The original White Methodist career moved away in the 1930s.
The nearby congregation of black men acquired the building.
St. Martins took over the Blacks congregation under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the 125th Street merchants of Harlem's main shopping street, against the wage or promotion of these opposed blacks.
In 1939, a fire incinerated the building badly, and when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild, they introduced a towering bell game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martins, proudly called the towering bell game "the bells of the queue."
In July, an expert who called the towering game called it "cultural art" and "an irreplaceable historic instrument".
The University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that it was the world’s first tornado game played by the black-and-white musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who changed to the larger tower game played at the Riverside church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
St. Martins has developed in the last few months a complex vigour, with its contribution to the church's land managers and, on the other hand, the architects and contractors hired by the Episcopal Hippership.
Sachti - the administrative body of the local leaders of the congregation - wrote to the Hippo in July, expressing its concern that the Hippokunta would "try to pay the costs" to the sachast, even though he had not participated in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the Hippokunta.
Some congregation members complained of a lack of transparency regarding the hive.
Hai hurt 13-year-old lobster-sucker in California
Authorities report the shark attacked the 13-year-old boy and injured him while diving lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before seven in the morning.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB TV that he was diving with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard a boy crying out for help. He and a group of others were talking to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel told me that he thought first that the boy was only excited after catching a lobster, but then he realized this screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!'
After getting to the boy, Hammel says he found that this whole cellular bone had broken open.
"I cried everyone out of the water, there's shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of shark that was attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles, at the media conference, said that some weeks earlier sharks had been observed in the area, but it was found to be harmless species.
Giles added serious injuries to the victim's upper body.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casablad’s Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for scientific and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for the United Kingdom's beauty care industry
Sainsbury's challenge Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams in department-style beauty care departments serving expert consultants.
This is a significant business for the UK's $2.8 billion beauty care sector, which continues to grow, even though sales of fashion and household goods are declining. Larger beauty care departments are experimenting with 11 stores across the country and, in success, will be expanding to other stores next year.
Beauty products are placed because supermarkets are trying to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and household supplies.
Sainsbury's describes its range of beauty products as doubling to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space, and will be given more space in their own brand-specific areas, like the Boots stores.
The Supermarket will also launch its Boutique makeup range again. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly, as young shopkeepers are demanding it more and more.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop is testing rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second is opened at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the switch to retail small one-off shopping forces supermarkets to create new incentives for customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look more like department stores when the supermarket chain struggles against cheap stores such as Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After purchasing both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, as well as Habitat stores. The company tells us that it has promoted food sales and made profitable purchases.
Supermarket failed in its previous company to renew its beauty care and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's experimented with the joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended with regard to how the output of pharmacies located in supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy is followed by a business transaction in which Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacy stores to Celesio, the Lloyds Pharmacy chain's owner, at £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds told us that Lloyds is part of a plan to expand the range of luxury skin care products to four stores with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty care departments to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained workers who are ready to advise customers.
Our selection of brands responds to all our needs and attractive environments as well as our convenient location make us a convincing beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way to make purchases."
Peter Jones in the frown after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the £11 million contract
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in his "quiet," when TV drinker Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and home label for Truly.
The two companies have been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old director of this morning programme announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angry Dragons Den star Peter Jones by retreating from their productive lifestyle business at the last minute. He is now going to focus on his new giant deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources tell of Jones's "weakness" last Tuesday at a tense meeting held at Jones's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. TV star girl had admitted that her new $1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for their home and home label Truly.
The company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand and was recommended to double Willoughby's estimated GBP 11 million.
37-year-old Willoughby reported that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: "Truly was Holly's obviously the most important project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision of departure has left all the surprises in the hands of him.
No one believed on Tuesday events so close to publication.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold".
This Morning drinker is one of Britain's most reliable stars, and his departure, according to experts, may lead to millions of losses for the company due to product investments, which include all the cushioned candles and clothing in household supplies, not to mention delays in publication.
It can mean the end of a long friendship.
Three children’s mother Willoughby and her spouse Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones for ten years and Tara Capp, his wife.
Willoughby organized Cappin Trulyy in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones became Chairman in March.
Couples are on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is baked from the new M&S brand shop and replaced by I'm A Celebrity of Ant McPartlin's ITV program.
The source near Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
♪ And then we fell in love ♪
He joked about the criticism in the media of his comments, which some people thought were inappropriate for the President, and about his gratitude to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he was pretending to be the "new anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up at all."
He noted Kim’s interest in reconvening after Trump’s first meeting in July as a significant step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, nuclear negotiations have broken down.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea's top diploma Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "equivalent reaction" from the United States to the early disarmament efforts in North Korea.
Instead, he stated that the United States would continue its sanctions with a view to maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"There's a great deal going on with North Korea," he said.
"We were fighting a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship."
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. The pilot tests have been stopped, hostages have been helped to freedom and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when he talked about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get an extra 10,000 out of this mess, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, showing the audience right in front of us.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign voluntary organisations were told that they are not needed.
The national emergency needed for international assistance was not declared, although some 10 per cent of the people of Lombok had been homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so the situation is a bit challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children form a group travelling back, it is not certain whether a foreign staff can work in the field.
According to the National Disaster Agency’s informant Sutopo, the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in the country in order to see whether international organisations are allowed to participate in the aid work.
Indonesia remains, unfortunately, unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account repeated earthquakes on a regular basis.
Although Aceh has built tsunami shields, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The return was likely to be lost due to a tsunami warning disorder, although the warning was valid.
Travel between numerous Indonesian islands is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship prescribed to help the victims of the earthquake in Lomboki is on its way back, but will last at least three days before reaching a new accident zone.
President Joko Widodo made the development of the current infrastructure in Indonesia at the centre of his election campaign, and he has made money to improve roads and railways.
Each administration has, however, suffered a financial deficit while the new elections are approaching next year.
Each pressure also increases tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims in the country have adopted the older form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have had street strikes with jungle knives, bows and arrows, as well as other primal weapons. This has led to the death of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands have had to leave their homes.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge ingested a late balance against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool’s defeat on Saturday, after a 89-minute painting on Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a feed from Xherdan Shaqir, 27 from Chelsea goal, when his team was in goal loss position.
He moved the ball to the left before he horrified at the back of the shot.
The shot floated high above the penalty area toward the right upper hand.
Eventually, the ball dropped tossing over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself play in order for players like Ball and Shaq to play as much up as possible, so I was just trying to create for myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told the LiverpoolFC.com site.
"I saw Kante approach, took one touch, and fired too much."
Chelsea led the match in half-time 1-0 after Eden Hazard of Belgium painted in 25 minutes.
The Blues head gave the Mateo Kovacic a head-to-head diet in a situation before turning away near the middle field and sprinkling to the Liverpool side of the field.
Kovavic played a fast-paced wall-nut in the middle field.
Then he released Hazard into the penalty zone with a great breakthrough.
Hazard fled the defense and passed Liverpool with the left leg shot by Alison Becker in the back.
Liverpool meets the champions' league in the block phase of Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet at the UEFA European League Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832.
On early Sunday, the Indonesian Disaster Agency reported an increase in the number of victims of earthquake and tsunami to 832 victims.
At the press conference, the agency’s publicist Sutopo Purwo reported that many had been trapped in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed, when the 7.5-magnitudi earthquake struck on Friday and raised up to six metres high waves.
The ruins of Roman buildings spread widely to the city of Palu, with 380 000 inhabitants.

Parliament's Cromwell statue became part of history's rewrite booklet
The evicting of the statue would be a poetic right, given that his own fanatic puritans destroyed the cultural and religious objects of England as well as the best Taliban.
However, Crick's proposal for "typery" and "rewrite history" was described by Cromwell.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing argument for the removal of statues would make a target for Oliver Cromwell's statue in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or execute the Iconoplasm of British Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell might suffer from the actions of Thomas, his forefather who lived in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent description of Cromwell reflects the views of the 19th century and is a historical proof of the character that many still view as worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, although perhaps more in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament's external pressure, which, of course, caused monarchy in this case.
If this is a precise description of the subject, then it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, at least, that the mid-teenth century dispute has shaped our nation's subsequent development, and Cromwell must, in turn, identify the figure representing the other side of that division.
Moreover, his achievements as a state manager deserve praise and memory".
Killer's murdering the Chinese farmer's death
The local media tell the pig that attacked the farmer and killed him on the market in South China.
Only the body of a man named "Yua" was found near the pig at the Liupanshuin Square in Guizhou Province. The man’s artery had broken and he was on top of the blood, the South China Morning Post news on Sunday.
The pig population is preparing to vaccine pigs in the pig population on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qingha Province, China.
He and his cousin travelled from the nearby Yuna province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on Thursday.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also found the door of a nearby piglet open.
In the piglet he said he saw a big bear whose mouth was in the blood.
According to the news, the criminal investigation confirmed the death of a 250-kilometer bearer.
The Guiyang Evening News says my cousin named Wu said my cousin's legs were bloody and broken.
The surveillance camera shows the cousin arriving on the market feeding pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man who killed him didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the tower leaders told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it would not harm others while collecting evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the law enforcement authorities are told to negotiate the death penalty.
Pigs are known to have attacked people before, although it is rare.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, an almost 300-pound pig hurried against this tractor by a Welsh farmer until the wife managed to hurry her animal away.
The Oregonian farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012. After the event, the farmer living in Manitoba told the CBC News that although pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of the blood can act as a trigger.
"They're just games.
They're like little kids, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
All we have to do is respect them properly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa’s remains bring vast hard rains to the southwestern parts of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to decline when moving over the coolest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rosa will be bringing floods to northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States.
Rosa's wind speed was 38 meters per second, one-class hurricane, in the morning of the fifth eastern coast time, and it was 620 km to lunch from Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific Ocean is forming a lowland that is heading east towards the west coast of the United States, and when Rosa arrives on Monday in California as a tropical storm, she starts blowing deep tropical humidity northwards towards the southwestern parts of the United States.
Rosa brings up to 250 mm of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical moisture that then interacts with the approaching low - pressure agent will form large rain areas for lunch in the coming days.
Local rainfall of 25-100 millimeters causes dangerous heavy rain floods and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes precipitation in certain landing areas between 50 and 75 millimeters per hour, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 50-100 mm of rain is expected in certain areas of lunch, especially Arizona.
Rough floods are possible and conditions may deteriorate rapidly due to the spread of tropical rain.
In the event of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid going to the wilderness.
The heavy rains can turn the canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms produce local breezes and flying dusts.
Nearing the lowlands brings local hard rains to the coastal waters of Southern California.
The rainfall of more than 10 mm is possible, causing small waste streams and sloping you.
It would be the first rains in the region during the rainy season.
The scattered tropical rainstorms begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
The coastal rains spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last for the whole middle of the week.
In October, the U.S.A. can see powerful fluctuations in temperatures during the cooling of the Arctic, but even when the tropic remains rather warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations at short distances.
The central part of the United States has an excellent example of major temperature differences on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omahan and between Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowa Des Moines is almost 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
The heat that lasts in the summer is once again trying to increase and expand in the coming days.
From the beginning of October it is expected to be warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with a temperature of +26 degrees Fahrenheit from the south to the north.
In New York, the temperature can hurt on Tuesday at +26 degrees, which would be about 4 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast, eastern United States has good prospects for higher average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Tuesday, more than 20 million people watched a six - channel broadcast in which the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of a sexual offence in the 1980s, gave their fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political situation continued as television companies interrupted their broadcast at the last moment, according to which the FBI conducts a week-long investigation into charges based on an agreement organised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100% sure that the drugged Kavanaugh was gonna turn him off and try to take off his clothes in high school.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave a sentimental statement of witness saying that it was 100% certain that this was not the case.
Visitors were likely more than 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company decreased viewer averages on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The numbers of other channels sent, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Furthermore, Nielsen often has difficulties in measuring viewers who watch in offices.
Some of the proportions indicate that the reading corresponds to the number of spectators in the American football fall game or the Oscar gala.
According to Nielsen, the largest audience among all television companies was Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment. On average, there were 5.69 million viewers in the channel during the whole day’s consultation.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
The Friday drama was Flake.
The CNN and CBS cameras described how the protesters' screams put him in the elevator on the way to the hearing of the Justice Committee on Friday.
CNN looked straight on how he stood with a minute sticker looking down on the flight of the tunes.
"I stand right in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you believe him to tell the people the truth?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told."
Flake said that he had given his office an opinion and added, before closing the elevator doors, that he would have more to tell after the committee had been consulted.
Hours later, cable and public broadcasting networks sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs started voting on Mr Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he was only acting on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate in the coming week, as the minority democrats have demanded.
Flake was convinced to be part of his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, on the basis of his discussions.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans did not have sufficient votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit politics
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accuses his EU-disaggregated plans of the politicians who threaten the future of Britain and its national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
On the front page of May's interview with his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, was published another interview in which he continued his attack on his so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls for a proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should recover each other's import duties "unreasonably".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of the death of LSU player
The police have arrested a person suspected of shooting a basketball player at LSU, 20-year-old Wayde Sims.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to jail, and according to Baton Rouge's police department, he's being charged with a second-degree murder.
The authorities published a video of Sims-Simpso's account of the police telling us that Sims had lost her eyeglasses.
The police found the glasses at the scene and told them they had found Simpson's DNA, says WAFB.
The police tell us Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde in interrogation.
According to Advocate, $350,000 was set aside for his guarantee.
East Baton Rouge's coroner of death published a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a shooting in the neck.
The Agency would like to thank the Police Task Force of the State of Louisiana, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the region for assisting with the investigation into the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU sports director, thanked the law enforcement authorities for their "nutrition and enforcement".
Sams was 20 years old.
The two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father also played basketball in LSU's.
He posted an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 recordballs in the match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that he was "feared" and "crowded" about the death of Wayde.
"You're always afraid of something like this," Wayde said.
The volcano spits on Mexico City
The ash from the popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the Mexican Disaster Prevention Centre called on citizens to stay away from the volcano, as the crater’s activities accelerated and 183 gas and ash explosions had been registered during the day.
The center registers the grain and shake several times.
In social media, pictures were published in which the thin ash layer was covered by car windshields in residential areas such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed 72 kilometres from the capital to the south-west of the volcano after Mexico shook a 7.1-gloss earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan parasites gather before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in a rally of independent protesters and riot police. Thousands participated in the competing demonstrations on the first day of the referendum.
The police arrested the group of masked independenceists who threw police with eggs and powder paint that formed dark dust on streets normally filled with tourists.
Over the course of the day, more chacoons broke out when the police used their bats to control the scumbags.
The associations between the supporters of independence and the groups of the Unionists continued for several hours, when the former shouted "no forgetfulness, no forgiveness" and the latter "live Spain".
The local press reports that fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries in demonstrations.
The tension is still on the surface in an area of independence, one year after the October 1st referendum, which has been declared illegal by the Catalan parasites.
The voters chose independence by a clear majority, although participation was low in the boycott of those who opposed it.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured in the violent clashes of last year when the police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
Independent groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
The demonstration, however, was organised, but it had to follow the other route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a Separatist demonstration with his wife, said that there is no longer any hope of Catalonia's independence.
"Last year, we experienced one of the best moments of our lives."
This is how my parents cry for joy in being able to vote, but now we are stuck in place," he says.
Despite the stalemate achieved in the regional elections of last December, despite the vital victory, the pace of the parties in Catalonia’s independence has been stagnated this year. Many of the most well-known leaders are either in exile or in detention waiting for a trial on their involvement in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who photographed a police-protest on his phone, says that on both sides of the political scene there is a blasphemy dispute.
"Your place is getting tight all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders in detention for the last nine years, announced his participation in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Being a European candidate is the best way to condemn the crackdown on democratic values and repression we have seen by the Spanish Government," he says.
Londonderry: Men were arrested after a car hit the house
The 33-, 34- and 39-year-old men were arrested after the car was reported to have repeatedly collided with the house in Londonderry.
Events progressed in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 in British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
There's a way to get a car, and there's a place where you could shoot with a sparrow.
Livingston won the Rangers 1-0 with Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston ensured victory
In 18 games, the series director Livingston envisioned Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard to lose second in the Ibrox team.
Finally, Dolly Menga's goal was enough to win the Gary Holt team as he stepped up to a second place in Hibernian.
Gerrad's crew stayed in the Premiership for the first time without winning the season. Next, it will meet next Sunday, the serial director Hearts, who is eight points ahead.
The Rangers will meet in Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his free-for-profit line-up in six games, and Chief Coach Holt hasn't lost once since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost the place to a guest suffering from the lack of steel
Holt's team should have been in charge long before the goal was scored after the Rangers had suffered severe difficulties.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide. Next, Alan Lithgow was able to slide into Craig Halkett's puss, but he passed the ball.
The hosts gave the Rangers popular ball control because they knew they could vaccinate special situations.
That's exactly how the important goal came to be.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Menga, where he managed to move the ball to the center of the penalty zone and finish.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but said the home team would hold the defense, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly allowed to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow led the ball by another special situation in Livingston.
The concentration of the rain in the Livingston penalty zone was constantly cleaned out, and two situations were called for in vain penalty kicks, with Halkett's targeted changer Glenn Middleton and hand-picked ball.
"Great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland at Lamont Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent for every player, continuing through the ups and downs.
The way in which the team plays and the crew has not changed much since it returned to the highest level of the series, however, Holt has to be recognized for the way in which he has strengthened the team once he has reached it.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at leading an excellent organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worralli on his toe for the entire match.
The Rangers, though, lacked ideas.
The team has performed very well at times under Gerrard, but has now remained far from his standards.
The last entry was left out, and they managed to open the home team defense only once. This should act as a wake-up to the Rangers, which is the central cast of the series table.
Erdogan received a varied reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met with breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, the purpose of which is to correct NATO's relations.
There have been differences in human rights and freedom of the press as well as in Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented a group of 25 000 supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, justifying it for security reasons, but a lot of supporters were still gathering nearby to see the President.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also brought their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to invite him to the country.
The competing demonstrations reflect the division of opinions, and some Turkish people greet him as a hero when others mock him as self-governing.
Road accident at Deptford: Biker dies in collision with car
The biker died when he hit the car in London.
The accident occurred at about 10 a.m. local time in the southwestern part of Deptford, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, with busy traffic.
The car driver stopped and the nurse came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic accident on Children Street, about one and a half miles from the accident site on Saturday.
The city police tell us they're trying to identify a man and inform his loved ones.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic has been diverted away. Car drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in unrest
Prison officials report a high safety rating of the wounded six prison guards in the prison’s unrest.
Annoying began at the HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire about 09:30 a.m. on Sunday in British time and continued.
Tornado Special Police have been brought to the scene to calm the unrest behind which there are eight prisoners in one prison wing.
The minor face injuries of the police were handled at the scene.
A prison reporter said, "HMP Long Lartin has been sent to a prison to take care of the situation by trained prison staff.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken over by the police and they may have to go behind longer bars."
There are over 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the head of the prison was reported to have received hospital care after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In addition, in October, riot police were alerted to the prison because of serious unrest in which the personnel were attacked with the billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of severe floods to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drylands can benefit)
There are rarely tropical lowlands coming to Arizona, but that's what happens at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa's remains move across the southwest desert, bringing with them the risk of heavy rains.
The national weather service has already warned of heavy floods during Monday and Tuesday, from West-Arizon to southern and eastern Nevada, south-east-Kaifornia and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, FlagSFin, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, coming in the form of rains on Monday.
Phoenix’s national weather service noted in its tweet that “only ten tropical storms have preserved a tropical storm or low-level state at a distance of 300 kilometres from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest modeling of the National Hurricane Centre predicts rains of between 50 and 100 millimeters. The Mogollin drill in Arizona can rain up to 150 millimeters.
In other southwestern desert areas, including the middle rock mountains and the Great Basin, there are indeed 25-50 millilitres. There may be a total of up to 100 millimeters of rain in the area.
Rosa's rains can also be a blessing for drought by testing the area if there is no danger of heavy rain.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains may be beneficial, as severe drought has been experienced in southern lunch.
According to the U.S. Drying Agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, says weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first makes his way to the California Peninsula in Mexico.
The location of Sunday morning Rosa is 620 kilometres from Mexico's Punta Eugenia to the south. It is then still a hurricane at a wind speed of 135 kilometres per hour. It moves north at an hour speed of 20 kilometres per hour.
The storm loses its power when it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico during a tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, the rains can be severe and cause a significant flood.
"California's peninsula is expected to reach 75-150 millimeters, and up to 250 millimeters is possible," says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical low in the morning hours of Tuesday, where she will continue her journey through Arizona to southern Utah until late on Tuesday..
"The greatest risks of rosy or its remains are associated with very severe rains in the California Peninsula, in the North-Sonor region and in the south-west of the United States," says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rains and waste streams in deserts, as well as earthquakes in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested as suspects of a murder attempt after the 16-year-old boy had been found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning in the UK time.
He was taken to a hospital where he is said to be in a "stable" state.
The police report that they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old Radstock in Avon and Somerset during the night.
The police are asking for contact with anyone who may have video material recorded on the mobile phone about events.
Trump says "the light and anger of the democratic party in Kavanaugh."
"Sound on behalf of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and disgraceful methods of the democratic party," Trump said at the Wheeling meeting in Western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered from the democratic party's "brightness and anger" throughout his entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh proved before Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual harassment that would have happened decades ago during their teen years.
Ford also testified to his accusation during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said "the American saw Kavanaugh's fineness, character and courage" on that day.
"The voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is the voice of one of the most well-deserved legal scholars of our time, who has excellent merit in public service," he told his West Virginia support team.
The President indirectly referred to Mr Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican voting in the interim elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning, I'm campaigning," he said.
"That's why I'm going all over the place to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats took on the task of "resistance and inhibition".
Senior Deputy to the Republican Party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in the Kavanaugh nomination procedure is expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of dead in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of deaths expected to rise
On Saturday, the authorities reported at least 384 major earthquakes and tsunami attacks on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia. Many of them were wiped with giant waves that struck the shores.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at the festival held on the shores of the city of return, when up to six metres of waves hit the shore at night. Many were washed away when waves destroyed everything.
The tsunami caused the strong earthquakes of 7.5 magnitud.
When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach, and they did not immediately escape, leaving it as a victim," says Indonesia's big-accident mitigation agency, BNPB's publicist Purwo Nugroho in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, but it pulled with it cars, wooden trunks, houses and hit all over the country," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached an open sea speed of 800 kilometres an hour before it hit the coast.
Some of the people survived the tsunami by climbing to trees, he tells.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in the Return.
The aerial images published by the Agency show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and the mosque around the water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people in the area.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency BPPT issued an opinion stating that the energy released during the massive earthquake on Friday corresponded to about 200 atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the terrain of a city at the far and narrow bay could be a source of tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "broad" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had fallen.
He reported that some of the bodies of the victims had been found in the ruins of the fallen buildings and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims of the death and that the damage may be greater in the area that is closer to the centre of the earthquake, which is 300 kilometres northwards on the continuous coast, called Donggala.
Communication links "are completely broken and Donggalast has not received any information" says Nugroho.
According to the Red Cross statement, over 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become even worse," he said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not telling us about the tsunami’s impact on the Return. True, the authorities said that the waves had arrived during the warning.
In a social media amateur video, a man in the upper floor of the building shouts loudly at the people approaching the tsunami on the street.
Only minutes later, the beach is hit by a water wall that will take you by buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the image matter.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications links around the country, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
The authorities say that the army has begun to send help from Jakarta and other cities by means of transport machines, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been reopened for aid purposes only and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is really bad.
World Vision Donggala’s staff have come to safety in the city of Palu, where they have been housed in the tent roofs in the inner courtyard of the office. On their way, they passed the scene of destruction, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
The situation is really bad.
At the initiative of the relief teams, some complained that foreign workers would be prevented from travelling back to the country.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel may not start to flow until the accident zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"There is still a provincial disaster," says Aulia Arriani, a publisher of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the government says "OK, this is a national disaster", we can begin to receive international assistance, but the declaration has not yet been made."
When the other night landed on Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the missing friends and family members felt the hope that their loved ones would be different from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was raised from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian Dependency Team, had trained two missing dependants for Asian races earlier this month.
The Roa Roa Hotel was also trapped by his students, says Mandagi.
"As a parent of the League, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon tells us that he has been desperately trying to reach the competing people who participated in the beach festival with WhatsApp messages after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the dependency community.
However, there was only one grey sign after the messages he sent out, instead of two blue ones.
"It means, in my opinion, that no messages have been received," he says.
The thieves took $26,750 to the ATM supplement at Newport on the Leve
The thieves took 26 750 dollars from the Brink's security company on Friday morning, while it was completing the ATM in Newport on the Leve, reported in Newport Police News.
The driver of the car had been emptying and supplementing the ATMs in the entertainment centre, according to Dennis McCarthy in the press.
When Brink's employee was found elsewhere, "he was running my man" who stole his money for delivery as well.
According to the press, observers saw several people fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
Persons with information about their identity are asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rocker changes its name to Ye
Rappary Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "the character previously known as Kanye West".
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for some time, and he also used it as the eighth album's name published in June.
The change is preceded by his upcoming performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yanghi.
He replaced singer Ariana Granden in the program, who, according to the programme's author, withdrew his participation "for sentimental reasons".
West has previously told us that the word also has religious significance for him, not only that it is a abbreviation of his profession.
Speaking of the name of the album earlier this year with radio driver Big Boy, West said, "I believe that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you".
"So I'm you, us, and all of us.
It began with Kanye, which means pure, and ended up in a shorter form Ye - which only expresses the goodness, evil, confusion, and everything in us.
The album is mainly a reflection on who we are".
He's one of several well-known rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known differently as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Also West's previous partner, JAY-Z, has removed and returned the connecting line and the big letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use an army against civilians
The president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised that he would never use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared at Tlatelolco Plaza Square on Saturday, promised that "there would be no use of the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The armed forces arrived at a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the leftist student groups were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student support and opening up more free public universities.
He said the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities was driving young people into criminal gangs.
States should double the funding of artificial intelligence research
The United States should double the funding it uses to investigate artificial intelligence as China enhances its activities in the industry. This is what Google, Microsoft and Apple say about the funder and artificial intelligence professional Kai-Fu Lee.
The opinion was preceded by reports on artificial intelligence from various parts of the United States administration, although a formal artificial intelligence strategy was lacking from the United States.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become a leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget of the artificial intelligence research would be a good start, considering that the other countries are so much behind the US, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough of artificial intelligence," says Lee.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence aid would be made in the United States, Lee told us in this week’s CNBC interview.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of the Factory: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as CEO of the Sanovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's most important artificial intelligence companies called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which defeated the United States’ highest-ranking Othello player. Later, he served as head of Microsoft Research as well as director of Google’s Chinese operations.
Lee acknowledged the US administration's previous technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when would the next be organised to identify future visionaries?
Lee says the American scientists worked hard to get public aid.
"Academic influencers don't take China, they're the big companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to strengthen its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think that people who have completed an artificial intelligence PhD should automatically admit green cards," he said.
The Chinese Government’s next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation grants funding to academic staff in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state-owned organizations grant money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China," Lee said.
Previously this year, the US Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industry and academic partners throughout the world, and the White House has also announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
In turn, NSF invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, legislation aimed at setting up the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonian referendum amending the name of the country
In a referendum on Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country to the "North Macedonia Republic" and to resolve the dispute over decades with Greece, which has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
In the view of Greece, which owns the province of Macedonia, the northern neighbourhood is in practice a regional requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its accession to membership of the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries reached agreement on a new proposal for a name, but the nationalist opponents felt that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign against the vote will raise doubts as to whether the voting activity will reach the required 50% limit in order for the result to be legal.
The issue on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership adopting an agreement with Greece".
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's supporters of the name change reason that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, which has risen since the collapse of Yugoslavia, can become a member of both the EU and NATO. .
"Today, I came to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote to have a decisive effect.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
No irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m. by the Central Election Commission.
However, the turnout was only 16 compared to 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, at which time 66% of those entitled to vote finally gave their vote.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia , Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum on Macedonia's change of name in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The change of name would open the way for NATO and EU membership .
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and put the chairs before the Boikotian-built tents in front of the Skopje parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join heads upright, not through the kitchen door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to the other side, like China and Russia, as part of the euro area integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment in Macedonia, with unemployment rates above 20%.
"The vast majority of our citizens are voting in favour of a change of name because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he had given his vote.
He said the "yes" voice was "the future that we're about to unlock."
The opinion poll published by my Macedonian political research institute on Monday referred to 30-43% voting activity in a referendum, i.e. under the required activity.
In the second survey of Macedonian Telma TV, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they were voting in favour of the Yes option.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the voter turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
Failure to vote would be the first serious setback for the Western government to take over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero defeated the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
At 65 minutes, Aguero made the paint he made look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the picture, the Argentinean top player was fed from the middle field.
He found an empty space in the field by rushing through the three Brighton fighters.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one of the defensemen and then left a number of others on the edge of Brighton's punishment.
Then he found Sterling to deliver the ball to the left.
The English lead used its first touch within the penalty zone to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton-watched Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot in the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told the journalists that "Aguero has problems with his feet."
"We said he'd be playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he made a goal in that time."
Sterling, however, had already given the blues an advantage in the election struggle.
The paint came in at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful breakthrough on the left side.
Sane made a few contacts before sending a ball to the back of the ball towards Sterling.
The blue-winged attacker was working on the ball's net just before the end of his life.
City will meet at 12:55 a.m. in Sinsheim, Germany, in the block phase of the Hoffenheim Champions League on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play the game against Rockies.
So, the Nationals are out there in the fall game fight, so why try to get into the starting composition with the most forceful?
However, always as competitive as Scherzer hopes to take over his emissary in the Sunday match against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff game. They have one victory difference in the Western series of Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies caught at least his wild card 5-2 win from the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still aiming for their first divisional win.
"Although we don't have a stake, at least we can get up to the audience, knowing that the atmosphere of the crowd and the other team here in Denver is creating the most demanding competition arrangement I've encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take the challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet published their starting point on Sunday, but according to information, they tend to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
On Thursday, Scherzer threw a training session, playing at the start of his 34 games and feeding his normal rest schedule on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed player has a win-and-lose ratio of 18-7 this season. ERA statistics are 2.53 and he's burned the hitter's nest 300 times, while the dial statistics are 220 2/3.
Trump Campaign in Western Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, while at the same time talking about the importance of Republican voting in the interim elections.
"All our achievements are in play in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election in our lifetime.
This is one of the great ones -- not just a campaign, but a full campaign, and that's why I'm going around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical democratic group, you see it happening right now.
They have decided to return to power by whatever means, and you can see their wickedness and their malice.
They do not choose whom to harm or whom to grind, so that they may enter into power. That is what they want, power and power, but we do not give it to them".
He said the Democrats took on the task of "opposing and preventing resistance".
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrong and evil and evil and false."
When he referred to the most powerful Democrat Senator, Diane Feinstein, of the Senate Court of Justice, the audience responded with loud noises.
"Do you remember his answer?
You left the document?
Uh, uh, what?
Well, um, no, I'm just waiting... it was a really bad body language... the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinion
I'm not really surprised when my local party, Momentum activists, supported the motion of censure against me.
After all, I am only the last representative of Labour, who is told that I am not welcome - just because we are saying our opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because he strongly opposed anti-semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was critical of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironic issues, of which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
On Friday, the Nottingham East Labour meeting stated that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years that I have been a local Labour representative have been the days of the party council on Friday.
There are now many meetings that do not follow that tone, and 'more friendly and gentle' politics has long since been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is even clearer that the Labour Party no longer tolerates differing views, and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether or not it is appropriate for the party leadership.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues who had thought I would share a similar political view began to expect me a full version and statements that I would never have agreed to, be they national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I speak publicly - and it does not really matter what I say - the result will be the belt of riots in the social media, which calls for my choice of a perum, the rejection of a central policy, and I hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I have received are, at least, political in nature.
I greatly respect the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face daily sexual and racist fits, and never falter.
The normalisation of fish farming is one of the most disturbing features of the policy of this age.
Last week, Jeremy Corby called for the Labour Party to adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with every motion of censure or change of election rule, the party becomes only more restricted.
For two years, I have been asked to keep my profile low and to refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "everything goes well".
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the failure of the Thatcher Government's single school, I have sought to promote better public services to those most in need.
I've never covered my political line, not even my last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been surprised by my views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that, as the government is moving towards a brexit that is damaging to households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy to question my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of separation or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that, in my opinion, is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible Ayr in block
Two last-minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr unquestionably earned the victory in the entertaining Tennent ́s Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of ten who have not lost any fights.
After all, a great defense and a more successful risk taking was what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can therefore be satisfied.
"We've been challenged in our fights and we're still invincible, so I can be satisfied." he says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, "All honor to Ayr, they took risks better than we did."
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card given by Scotland's captain Roy Hughes to Warriors enabled Melrosen to rise, and Jason Baggot scored the goal.
Climo raised the Ayri leadership with punishment targets, and just before the half-time he scored the goal and succeeded in the conversion kick by increasing the Ayri leadership to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, which Baggot managed to score the difference to five points in the conversion kick.
There was a long delay when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried out from the field. The game continued Ayr raised his lead on Stafford McDowall’s goal, which Climo succeeded in the conversion kick.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine made a hard pressure after a goal that the conversion kick failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from the ballless Climo, and Macpherson scored a goal after Ayri’s taste from the side-line shoot.
Climo got the conversion kick the same way he did before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and caught Gregor Henry finishing the fifth goal in the home team.
The star of the Still Game series starts in the restaurant sector
The star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran has been named Director of a licensed restaurant company and is expected to start working in this area as well.
A 56-year-old actor presents Jack Jarvis with his recommendation in the BBC program, which he writes with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Twokko has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the public records, he is registered as a director of the company Afahrtmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wanted to participate in Glasgow's flourishing restaurant business.
"The sea belongs to us": the inland Bolivia tries to regain contact with the Pacific Ocean by legal means
Marines patrol outside the naval base in La Paz.
The flag of public buildings is a sea-blue flag.
Ship support points for Titicacalta Amazon have been tainted with a slogan: "The sea is ours.
It's our duty to get it back."
In the inland Bolivia, a memory of Chile’s loss of resources in the 19th century is still strong, as is the need to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
The hope is highest in decades when Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has a strong progress, a common spirit and an aesthetic, and of course a positive attitude in waiting for a final solution," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzad.
Several Bolivians throughout the country, in the hope of the International Court of Justice’s decision from the big squares, hoping that, at the end of the decades, the Hague will be in favour of a halted debate, Bolivia’s position is that Chile has an obligation to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
The Caristic President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who will face the re-election of the war next year, will have a lot to play in the first Monday lineup.
"The peace of the Pacific Ocean is very close," he assured at the end of August.
Although some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it does, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch-led UN institution does not have the competence to give up Chile's administrative territory, and the ICJ has also announced that it will not end any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision is given only six months after the final statements have been issued suggests that the case is "not complex", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Moreover, the last four years have slowed rather than promoted Bolivia’s purpose.
"The new Bolivian regime has taken the question of sea connection," Zárate said.
Morales's challenging rhetoric has suppressed the rest of the Chilean charity, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold discussions at some point, but subsequent negotiations will be very difficult.
In both countries there has been no other embassy since 1962.
The former President and the representative of Bolivia in the Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not accept the view that the Court’s decision would have been exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "stop the 139-year differences with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of the most popular Latin American presidents, had used the question of maritime transport as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to connect to the Pacific," she added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move on from the past."
North Korea announced that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can rely on the United States.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can rely on Washington," said North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States of the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin's position came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is reopening with a deadlock diploma in nuclear weapons, only three months after the United States met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said that there is a "far-reaching dream" of believing that continued sanctions and US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongjang has first taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is alerted to the adoption of the declaration.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongjang was intending to abandon the armament arsenal, which the State probably sees as the only real way to guarantee its own security, has gained widespread doubt.
Pompeo is about to visit Pyongjang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris’s fashion shows present the main highlights of the latest line of models, which are soon to be found in your nearby street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not need to continue looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne exposed a selection of special super-big headboards in their SS19 show that would blur Paris' fashion weeks' style circles.
Very impractical headlines took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations to fashion shows as well.
Valentino's most eye-catching creation was a beige hat with wide feathers that covered the head of the models almost entirely.
Other oversized accessories were, among other things, ornamented with watermelon, sorcery, and even pineapple — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of extraordinary masks – just right before Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled more Hannibal Lecter than the top fashion.
One creature with a snorkel and a mask resembled more diving gear, and the other resembled the melted ice cream.
And if you want to take a stand for a big fashion, you got lucky.
The followers of the fashion predict that the huge scarfs are appearing on the ceiling.
The oversized hats closely follow the "La Bomba", a half-metre-long strawd hat that has been seen in every Rihanta Emily Ratajkowski.
In the social media, the cultivator of an impractical hat was also born into the fashion shows of another great creature — an oil - made dock that is almost as large as a model carrying it.
The incinerated orange beech ornamented with a razor bag with white leather straps had the most eye-catching creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 range in Paris at fashion weeks.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I have seen large-sized hats and beach bags on the street next summer – the designers have made such a big impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized furnishings."
John Edward: Language skills are key to the world’s citizen
The learning outcomes of the Scottish private schools have traditionally been good, and this success has continued as a result of good test results in 2018. The success has strengthened individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
These schools across Scotland are located in over 30 000 pupils, represented by the Scottish Private Schools (SCIS), who aim to provide high-quality services to their pupils and to the parents of the pupils.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen career, further education, higher education and world citizenship.
As an education provider, who can design and implement tailor-made study content, we have seen the position of languages as a popular and desired educational material in continuous educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message will go into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to build relationships with people from other countries.
In the latest test results of this year, we find that languages are at the top of the lists with regard to the percentage of access between private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade A.
The material was collected from 74 SCIS schools. Based on the material it was found that students who received the best grade A, 72% studied Mandarin Chinese, 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that the private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently freely selected, but they are kept in the same value as natural sciences (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private schools' curriculum and elsewhere.
On the basis of the survey conducted by the UK Employment Office in 2014, it was found that 17% of the situations where the employer had difficulties finding a suitable job were explained by poor language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary in order to promote the career development of young people in the future.
The more possible work tasks require language skills, the more essential these skills form in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he will have the advantage of this lifelong skill in the future, despite what career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner will automatically put a language-skilled person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGovi in 2013, more than 4,000 people in the United Kingdom were unable to hold a debate in a foreign language, and French was the only language with a double-digit number of 15%.
This is why investing in language teaching is important now for today’s children.
Knowledge of the languages of developing countries in particular will give children a better opportunity to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Many schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are expected to be important for the Isobritanese in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite your children’s concerns, there are always a number of language options taught at private schools by specialised teachers.
The private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills needed for success, whatever the future will bring.
In this time, it cannot be denied that languages in the international business environment will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
The current languages should indeed be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high level to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private Schools (SCIS)
LeBron makes the debyyt on Sunday in San Diego
The first appearance of LeBron James in the Los Angeles Lakers ranks is about to end.
Laker coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against Denver Nugget in San Diego on Sunday before the start of the season.
But how many minutes he really plays, remains to be seen.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton Lakers on their official website.
The Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to be playing for minutes.
James, who followed the exercises, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the six games to be played before the Lakers.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need any more pre-games to prepare," he said.
Time for Trump's Western Virginia Campaign, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
It's Trump's first five weeks of planned election, including compassionate targets such as Tenne and Mississippi.
Pending the vote on his election to fill the free seat of the Supreme Court judge, Trump tries to increase support for future interim elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in Congress in November's elections.
What time is the Trump campaign in Western Virginia today and how do you see it online?
Trump West Virginia Wheeling will begin at 19 o'clock on Saturday 29.9.2018.
You can watch Trump's Western Virginia campaign online as a live chat via YouTube by clicking on the bottom.
Trump may have taken a stand on the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court candidate of this week, who became fiercely charged with sexual harassment, which has delayed the Senate's confirmation vote every week during the FBI investigation.
But the primary goal for the campaign series is to support the Republican candidates in the strict November elections.
Thus, the five events of this week's President Trump campaign were commented on, "the purpose of which is to raise the number of volunteer and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress management is so essential to his purpose that the President is ready to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign period," said Reuters, an anonymous representative of Trump's campaign.
Today's event will take place at the Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and even "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" can be found there according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to Western Virginia, the state where he won over 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump supports the Republicans in the Western Virginia Senate election of Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind in polls.
"With regard to Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the President is trying to increase his support in the polls," said State scientist Simon Haeder of the University of Western Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team to show the battle will to keep hope ahead of Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions on Saturday afternoon, four games were just what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-affirming force of success is a phenomenon fully invented in sport, players believe in it, and more and more in tournaments such as this.
Where is this power of success with them right now?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed down to four, so we take this success force as a stake," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage: four points ahead and 12 playable.
The Americans, as Spieth said, experience a little wind in sails and a lot of encouragement, such as the state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which enabled them to play all day together and score three points out of four.
Spieth has been overwhelming on your green, leading by example.
The winning party's horny throats got stronger as he went round when he succeeded in a critical pit to balance the match with four when he and Thomas were two points behind the two holes.
The pit where they won the 15th match was followed by a similar scream, which gave the impression that he believes that the US team has not yet lost.
"You have to focus really well and just take care of your own fight," Spieth said.
That's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players who have won more points when Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Ryder Cup's unquestionable legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special, but sweet twins have won four out of four perfectly.
"Moliwood" was the only twin who didn't do any bogies on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That tour, and the way in which they give and get energy from this pompous audience, confirms that they are the vanguards on Sunday. And when the sun sets at Le Golf National, the second most popular player in Europe to ensure the potential victory could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
Better both at the same time on different holes.
However, the speeches about Europe's success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly lost Alex Noren's paired Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the morning four-game.
One bog and two double bogs on the first nine holes dug the Spanish and Swedish so deep into the pit that they were not even close to surviving there.
Although, on Sunday, no one will help you out of the pit.
Four-ball and four-ball are fascinating from the point of view of cooperation: what kind of advice they give or do not give and how the strategy can change in an instant?
Europe has played better as a team up to now and has taken a major lead before the last day, but this four-year game showed that the US team has a fighting desire, even though it has been suspected in the United States in particular.
Europe takes 10-6 lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in good management before the last day of the Ryder Cup after they took 10-6 lead in four-balls and four-balls on Saturdays from the United States.
The great double Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the victory process with two winning Tiger Woods, and got a high score at four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who made a great effort to keep the victory lost two years ago in Hazeltine, managed poorly without fear of the US team in the morning four-ball, leading the match to a situation of 3-1.
The United States was a tougher opponent in four games winning two matches, but they could not narrow the lead.
The half of Jim Furyk needed eight points from Sunday 12 to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who has won four points in a row. He and Molinari, who are also called "Molliwood", were sensational after the weekend in Ryder Cup history, another double who has won four points in the first four games.
After they first broke in a four-ball match between Woods and Patrick Reed, they then even more powerfully finished 5-4 with the super-born Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau.
Woods, who barely survived through two matches on Saturday, was at times very brilliant, but has nevertheless lost 19 of his 29 matches in four ball and four game, and up to seven consecutive.
Justin Rose rested the square balls in the morning, but returned with Henrik Stenson to the square, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are in the rankings first and third.
Europe did not get everything in its own way on this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
Three-time prize winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the Americans at two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 from the Spanishman Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four ball, and later 4-3 from the Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four ball, however, after losing two first holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history the team has risen from four points to four-point drive station at the start of the double-games, even though on the side of Furyk, the balance is enough to keep the win.
Although, after two days of being the second best, it may be that Sunday’s counterattack is too much asked.
North Korea "never in the world" untrusted
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that continued sanctions only increased distrust of the United States, and in these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that in the past year, North Korea has taken "significant charitable measures", such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, decommissioned the nuclear test site and promised that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
"But we haven't seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so in such circumstances it is not possible for us to unarm ourselves."
However, while Mr Ri repeated the familiar complaint that Washington did not accept the phase-out of nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for every intermediate issue, his statement is important in the sense that unilateral disarmament was not completely excluded, as Mr Pyongjang has previously done.
He referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit of the first President of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June in a statement in which Kim convinced him of "the removal of nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to officially end the Korean war between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pyongjang first surrender his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States demands "nuclear disarmament first" and have increased pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its goal by force-suffering – even opposing "the declaration of peace," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions should get us on our knees is unconcerned hope.
But the problem is that constant sanctions only deepen our distrust."
He did not mention the plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings with the South Korean leader, Moon Jae-in, over the last five months, and added: "If South Korea and the United States were not involved in the disarmament process, the situation would not have progressed to such a deadlock."
Yet the tone of Rin's voice was considerably different last year when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the continental regions of the United States was inevitable after "bad president" Trump called Kim a suicide-prone "missile man".
As of last year Trump threatened to "destruct completely" North Korea. This year, however, Trump praised Kim’s boldness to approach the disarmament of weapons, but stressed that there is still a lot of work to be done and sanctions should remain until North Korea abandons nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump mentioned that he has no time limit: "If it lasts two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress already made.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions must continue to be strong and without fail until we prove complete, definitive and confirmed abandoning nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of halting the financial channels for the production of the ballistics and nuclear missiles in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with North Korea at the UN General Assembly in Rin, and announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit was not smooth.
While leaving Pyongyang, he described the progress that had been made, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangsteric demands" only a few hours later.
North Korea committed itself to closing the missile base and the nuclear facility at the meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in case the United States is taking "equivalent measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "equivalent measures" guarantees that Trump committed to the Singapore meeting and a move towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete an adequate rest instruction course
This year, all undergraduate students at Harvard University participate in a course aimed at increasing student rest. The course is a response to the macho culture that flourishes in the university, where students weigh long nights with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite unaware of the basics of their own well-being.
The course was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler of the University of Harvard Medical School, who is working with the University of Brigham and Women's Hospital, and believes that the course is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler received an idea for the course after a lecture on the influence of the sleep problem on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me, who said, "Why am I hearing this only now, in my last year of study?"
No one had ever told her the need for a dream, which I think was surprising," she told in the Telegraph interview.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how the right social skills support academic and sporting achievements and improve general well-being.
The professor of the Medical Faculty at Harvard University and Paul Barreira, Deputy Director of Health Services at the University, said that the university had completed a course after they had heard how students suffered from severe sleep during the study week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section presents students with a picture of the dorm room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thus getting information about the effects of caffeine and light as well as the impact of sleep on sports performances and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section tells participants how long-lasting sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
"We know that this has no direct effect on students' behaviour.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these issues in the same way that they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," Professor Czeisler adds.
According to Professor Czeisler, all night long study courses are still a matter of pride, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students made the problem of sleep increasingly a problem.
"Getting a decent and high-quality dream should be a 'secret weapon' to the students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even against weight gain, because the dreaming causes a state similar to hunger in the brain, which is why man is constantly hungry," the professor points out.
Raymond So, a Californian 19-year-old chemical and physical psychology student, helped Professor Czeisler to plan a course after he had participated in one of the courses he taught during his first year in Harvard last year.
He tells of the course that opened his eyes and gave the impulse to all campus students to organize a comprehensive course.
He hoped that all further students would be able to carry out a similar study before being transferred to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students be alarm clocked to remind them of their sleep time, as well as morning wake-up, and urges them to bear in mind the side effects caused by electronic display equipment and LED lighting on "blue light" on daily rhythms, which may make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengan’s shot took the victory from Gerradin’s players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers again had another day of defeat when Dolly Menga's shooting through the broken defense brought Livingston a 1–0 win.
The Ibrox players were getting their first win since February 4 to 1 game, which was played against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt’s team won this time, and Gerrard only now experienced second loss in the 18-game manager’s career. The Rangers got eight points behind the current leader of the league from Hearts.
Menga fired the ball seven minutes before the half-time, and then, at the drop of the Rangers, the situation was no longer balanced.
As a result of the game, the Rangers dropped to sixth place. The Livingston has instead climbed to third place, and the finish line above is only Hibernia.
The Rangers may have other problems, because during the game, Calum Spence was injured with an object thrown from the guest view at the head, and the wound has had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight changes to the composition with which the team had hit Ayri and advanced to the semifinals of the Scottish league.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 composition, where the team took the point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again produced the result, when a well-built composition managed to discipline the opponent in almost every turn.
Although Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using situations for his own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to finish the goal at two minutes when Menga’s first entry gave Scott Pittman a free way to Allan McGregor’s goal. Pittman, however, failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then led his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defenseman Alan Lithgow only managed to launch a wide backdoor.
On the other hand, Rangers took control of the game, but with the last third in the air, there was no longer any confidence.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when, at fifteen minutes, he and Steven Lawless had encountered each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian requests.
Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. Former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly, however, rejected the troubleless shot of Lassana Coulibaly’s bag and the Oviedo Ejaria.
Livingston's goal for 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the team's hard work.
The Rangers could still do nothing about Jacobs' long feeding tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who could cold-headed a ball for Menga's easy paint.
With the switch Gerrard decided to switch Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The switch affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack broke Kelly’s impressive fast defense.
Livings made visitors play their own game again, while Lithgow and Halkett continued long feeds after each other.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase their lead in the last moments of the game. McGregor's fine defense, however, prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow got to his positions at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who had been replaced by Rangers, also demanded a penalty shot after being taken together with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked away.
Almanakka: Geigermeter inventor
The next page on "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed the method for the detection and measurement of radioactivity.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and also a key concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado's Clocks" by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, for example, is very suitable for scientists who seem to be livestock shepherds:
Man: "What kind of a miracle is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geigermeter. It's used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put your headphones on your ears, you can really hear the effect of radioactive radiation on the minerals."
Evans: "Look, now it's really raging!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the cookie that carries his name still lives.
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of the treatment
In this method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory.
After processing, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the typical proteins of several cancers
Promising results have been obtained in patients with different cancers.
For example, cancer cells in an ovary cancer patient disappeared within 18 months after treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In this method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ several eating types of HER2 proteins. The modified cells are finally injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, USA, describes the method: "Our results make this a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "directs the growth of several types of cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer and are eaten with ovaries, lungs and colons."
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in a type of leukaemia treatment.
Kanye West got into the critics' teeth after celebrating Trumpia Saturday Night Live campaigned at her head.
The show didn't go according to plan
Kanye West got his neck blown in the Saturday Night Live entertainment program after celebrating the bold style of President Donald Trumpi and announcing his commitment to become President at the 2020 elections.
After presenting his third song of "Ghost Town" on Trump's Make America Great Again campaign, West, who was smitten, attacked the Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
"Most often when talking to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he's a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have changed from America a long time ago," he says.
Last night's broadcast began with a sketch in which Matt Damon called off Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Justice Committee, which relates to the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford about Kavanaugh's sexual harassment.
West's fasting was not presented in a live broadcast, but the comedian Chris Rock downloaded it into a broken social media.
It's unclear if Rock's intention is to mock West with his mail.
In addition, West complained to the public about being treated like him in the scenes because of his hat.
"I was tempted behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat in my head.
I've been bullied!
Then they say that I'm in the margin," West says in the Washington Examiner interview.
West continues, "Do you want to see what the margin means?" and says he's wearing the Superman reference because "then you can't tell me what I'm doing.
Try with love."
According to a variety, West’s comments exclaimed the audience at least twice, and the show’s actors seemed embarrassed. One of the people present described the situation to the press as follows: “The whole studio went completely silent.”
West was chosen for the program at a short warning time to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
In many viewers West caused confusion by presenting the song "I love it" in the Perrier bottle.
West receives support from Candace Turner, director of the Conservative TPUSA, who praised this courage on Twitter for saying, "I CAN'T MAKE IT."
However, the leader of the discussion programme, Karen Hunter, argued that West "has only self, which is all in all wonderful".
"However, I can decide TO BE a human being (by buying this music or a sign of clothing or by supporting this "art") which I consider to support and disseminate the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free person.
The same applies to us," he added.
Before the evening he announced that he had changed his name to "the person previously known as Kanye West".
West is not the first to change his name. The musician follows Diddy here, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late musical legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later an artist known as Prince.

Poison game actress Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging heroiole in Jon Snowna HBO's violent fantasy series Power Game.
Harrington, however, has attacked the stereotype of mahogany: according to an actor aged 31, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with Harrington in the Sunday Times cultural annex, he suspects that something has gone wrong, and questions the means used to intervene in toxic masculinity #MeToo during the age of the phenomenon.
Also recently, Harrington, a member of the Starcard of the Royal Court game, who was also married to Rose Leslie at the age of 31, admits that she has a strong desire to intervene.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity is now raising strong feelings in me," he says.
"What has been taught to men in the years of their growth, which has led to problems that can now be detected?"
Harrington believes that television and its very masculine characters are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continues, "What is born within and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel that they have to be certain in order to be men?
I think this is one of the major issues of our time – how can we change this?
Because young men have something really bad."
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the Pre- or Sub-Parties of the Royal Court game after the end of the series next summer because, according to his own words, he has "received the need for battlefields and horses".
In November, Harrington will be shown in the new version of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells of the filmmaker and this looter brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife Rose was the best thing the Kingdom game has offered him.
"I met my wife at this show, so kind of it gave me my future family and my life from then on," she says.
Rose Leslie starred in Ygritte, Jon Snow's love play by Harrington in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 on the Leslie family’s premises in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections in China has increased by 14%
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of its HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
Health authorities say that the virus affects more than 820,000 people in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change to previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the Yunnan province conference, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
However, a year later, the number of HIV infected and AIDS infected people in China has risen by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
While homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, it has been reported that the discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Studies have estimated that due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many diseases are caused by inadequate protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to ensure the general availability of HIV medicines as part of its response to the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the information of the worker who has been given a Republican licenser and accuses the dissemination of "dangerous lies" and "salary theories"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, the U.S. House of Representatives, contested the allegations that his employee had published personal information on the three Republican Imprisoners on Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic Representative from Los Angeles confirmed that the allegations were "extremely rightful" commentators and websites.
"Lights, lies and more demeaning lies," says Waters in his Twitter statement.
Among the information published are home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from the state of Utah.
The unidentified person published the information from the US Congress on Thursday during a hearing of the Senate committee on charges of sexual abuse against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred a little after three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Punds and RedState report that according to Hillin's message, messages were published by the IP address attached to the Waters office and by a person belonging to the Waters staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and it's an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My worker, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these false and false accusations, is not in any form responsible for the disclosure of this data.
This unjustified accusation is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' opinion quickly received criticism on the Internet, and the critics also included the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way in which he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his character is not suitable for Congressman.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There's no reason to be threatened.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
The situation should be moderate and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday’s hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is competing for Waters in the Congress interim elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievably if this is true," he tweeted.
In its opinion, Waters stated that it had contacted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies as a result of these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," he continued, "and that they will be brought to legal responsibility for all the devastating and dangerous actions against some or all of my staff."
Johnny English strikes again – the sub-standard Rowan Atkinson agent parody
The tradition has already been established to look for Brexit references from any film in Britain, but this does not seem to be appropriate for the Johnny English Agent Parody and the action comedy series, which started in the Johnny English Rain in 2003 and revived in the follow-up to 2011 "Johnny English – Newborn".
Can a language from the nation’s satirium in the cheek become a new national export defeat in Britain?
Yes or so, an eyeful, rubbery and incompetent Johnny English has already earned his permission to be a tyrant for a second time. Even his name tells above all about the fact that it is a compositional creation that is directed towards the outside film market in the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, about the twelve secret agents who desperately seek to live around the glamour, but appear to be a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and the unfortunate one-in-a-kind musician in London's 2012 opening concert.
The base of the character is the cosmopolitanism and the mysterious world man, who was originally presented by Atkinson in the television commercials of Barclaycard, which have already been forgotten.
There's a moment in the last performance.
I especially liked the scene when Johnny English arrives on a helicopter dressed in a medieval fireplace, and the rotor blades are tucking his helmet.
The gifts of Atkinson’s physical comedy come out, but humor itself seems sub-efficient and oddly unnecessary, especially because ‘stable’ film brands, such as 007 and the Dangerous Task, now offer humor as part of the film’s core content.
Humor seems like a lot to children, and I don't feel as clever and sharp-looking as the comics of Mr. Bean's mute roles in Atkinson.
Every year, the point of departure is that Britain is in worse trouble than before.
Kyberhakkeri has infiltrated the UK's top secret spy network and exposes the identity of all British agents in the field as an assailant of an agent in the service, which is a sad little role played by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last moment for the important and precipitous Prime Minister, who is already ready for his ears, even in the face of political disadvantage: Emma Thompson does everything in the skins of Teresa May, but the manuscript simply does not provide enough space for him.
As the counselors of the intelligence service inform him that all the spies in the field have been exposed, someone who has already left the active service must be called out of the field.
It is, of course, a challenging Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement days as a fine school teacher, but at the same time gives informal lessons in spying on the noble art. The topic is to acquit some clever jokes; English holds school of rock-type lessons in intelligence stores.
English is commended to the emergency meeting in White Hall, where he again meets his endless patient combat partner Bough, who continues to play Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to have access to his rights.
Thus, the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty’s secret service to face the fatal super-crime Ophelia Bhuletova by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, and Jake Lacy's acting Jason Volta claims to be able to solve computer problems in Britain.
English and Bough's odysse are immediately becoming a peach: the double, disguised as waiters, sparks a fine French restaurant fire and causes chaos while secretly striving for Volta's luxury hunts. The company learns about Volta's house using virtual glasses to end up in pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the last obstacles to the authors are raging in the final scene, but despite all the impotence and charm, the film still seems a bit made for the children's audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
As I watched Johnny English films, I've come to the same conclusion: why can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week with five-day pay
The Labour led by Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but the salary would be paid by five days.
The party is told that the transfer of the savings of an artificial revolution by demanding business leaders to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
The plan allows employees to enjoy three days of the weekend with the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of ‘opposing’ the party to the economic programme and its plans to raise the cost of policies for the benefit of the workers.
The Confederation of Trade Unions supports the move to a four-day working week as a means of enabling workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
The source of the high-level Labour Party tells the Sunday Times: "Pre-annual reporting on the revision of the guidelines.
The change does not take place at the moment, but the four-day working week is an objective that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first body to support the idea: the British Green Party committed itself to supporting the move to a four-day working week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective is not to receive undivided support in the Labour ranks.
The Labour Information Service states: "The four-day working week is not the policy of the party, nor does the party consider such a transition."
John McDonnell, Minister of Finance of the shadow government, used last week's conference to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from "unfavorable dictators" and from "technologists" of public-interest companies.
According to the Minister of Finance of the shadow government, the current shareholders of water companies would not be allowed to return their share in full, since the Labour government could implement 'reductions' on the basis of the abuses found.
He also confirmed the plans to put employees in the management of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of private sector companies' share capital to the management of employees, with an annual contribution of up to GBP 500 to an individual employee.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy in the 60-minute program will discuss whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The FBI judge Brett Kavanaugh’s investigation into charges against him has delayed at least a week’s final vote on the appointment of Mr Kavanaugh as Judge of the Supreme Court. The delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican prisoners for the appointment of Mr Kavanaugh.
In the 60-minute period of the programme sent on Sunday, the programme correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Party senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it could be possible for the FBI to find out things that would allow them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said by the time I heard... I said I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when the accusations came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, instead, looks like a rock hit.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's a bomb safe," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett denied it sharply," Graham added Christine Blasey to Ford referring.
"None of the people he named could confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old matter.
I can't see what the case might change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival in New York, is a music event with an actor card just as impressive as its mission to eliminate poverty from the world.
Now, the 7th Global Citizen Festival is attracting tens of thousands of people to the lawns of New York Central Park to listen to actors such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make the event known as a real goal: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
In 2012, the Global Citizen Festival will be a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group aimed at poverty eradication by increasing the number of people active in poverty eradication.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the public must perform a variety of tasks or "works", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to the political decision-maker or calling a call, or carry out any other act that spreads awareness of the project objectives.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded now that the goal has been achieved for more than 12 years?
Is there a real way to persuade people to take action with a free concert account, or is it just one ‘clittivism’ among others — the idea that the world can change by signing a web address or sending a TV?
Global Citizen reports that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" for different goals since 2011.
According to it, these actions have encouraged political decision-makers to declare commitments and principles equivalent to more than $37 billion and have been used in a way that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group listed 390 commitments and declarations on which more than $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the resources achieved have already affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in the United Kingdom, who have committed to "enhance children's development with their full potential". The group undertook to provide Rwanda with $35 million to complete malnutrition in the country, following the sending of 4,700 TVs to them as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the governments of Britain, donors, governments in different countries, and just like you, the world's citizens, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the newspapers," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Nutrition, at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British government was also called upon to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by more than 5 000 acts. The government has announced funding for the Power against malnutrition project is Nutrition, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the frequently asked questions on the website of the movement is: "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen's reply: "This will be a long and difficult road and a lot of stumbling blocks are ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as the great civil rights struggles and the anti-semitism movements before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are taking part in the New York concert this year, and its starboard includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, the country can make it more difficult to export energy by using the fleet as a barrier.
According to Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Interior Minister of the Washington Examiner magazine, when "needed" Washington can rely on its fleet to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including its neighbours.
Zinke claims that Russia’s activities in Syria – at the invitation of a legitimate government – are an excuse for the recognition of new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that [Russia] is the reason for the presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe," Zinken said.
According to the Authority, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep its shipping routes open through its fleet and, if necessary, to secure that the energy they provide does not end up on the world market," he says.
Zinke spoke to the public about the event organised by the Energy Consumers' Association, a group of non-profits that is profiled as "the voice of the energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington’s approaches with Russia and Iran, pointing out that this is one and the same issue.
"Iran's and Russia's economic alternative is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with fuel," he says, and describes Russia as "one trick circus number" on which economy is based on fossil fuels.
The opinions are due to take place in a situation where the Trump administration has sought to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace it with a much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
To enhance this, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to President Trump is binding on the Moscow youth in Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transmission capacity of the existing 110 billion cubic metres pipe, to be a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims to be purely economic behind Washington’s opposition and considers it an example of unhealthy competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure, and that consumers must have the opportunity to choose its supplier," says Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has led to a reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading umbrella organisation in the industrial sector, the German Confederation of Industry, has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that the third state interferes with our energy supply," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, head of the German Industry Federation.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, intends to consider carefully the nomination of candidate in the presidential elections in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced on Saturday that he "considered carefully" the presidential candidate after the mid-term elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering the candidate at an open interview in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix our bad administration, and this also means women on the head of the kingdom," he said, according to The Hill.
"After the sixth day of November, I'm going to think carefully about becoming a presidential candidate."
Warren assessed President Donald Trumpi during the occasion by saying that "he's taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," he says.
Warren has appeared in direct language in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote, "Surely, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, according to the opinion poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren voters do not support this conditionality in 2020.
According to Suffolk University Policy Research Institute and Boston Globe's study, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts do not support the Senator's nomination.
32% voted in favour of nomination.
Several of the respondents supported the former governor, Deval Patrick's assumption of 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other nominal democratic candidates who emerged in the elections in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press News Office, Biden has said that he will officially decide on his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war trauma at Donald Trump's election
Sarah Palin's son Track Pal, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the armed forces in September.
Track Pal was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son has to go through when he returns home, I can very well identify with other families who have to face the consequences and injuries of PTSD that our soldiers will be carrying back home," he told the audience in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who met with Donald Trump.
Palin called the arrest “the hippo in the living room” and said to his sons, like other war veterans “to return home a little changed, they return hard, they return thinking about the respect that he and his comrades in the army and in the Air Force have done for the benefit of this country.”
Track Pal was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to police informant Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence and assault against a woman, domestic violence and handling of a weapon.
18 Lands and the Columbia Association support the action brought against the new asylum practice
Eighteen states and the Columbia Federation are seeking a change to the new approach that has come into force in the United States that does not grant asylum to persons fleeing gang violence or family violence.
Eighteen representatives of the state and the federal government have submitted the Friends' Letter on Friday in Washington, D.C., to support asylum seekers who violate the guidelines, NBC News reports.
The full name of the person concerned has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions action brought by the American Civil Freedoms Union in August against the federal policy.
He told her that his partner, "and the sons of his violent gang," had assaulted her.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor, who supported Gracea, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, of which many asylum seekers are from the United States, as countries where gang and family violence are a problem that spread across all levels of society.
The new US asylum policy overturned the 2014 decision of the Asylum Appeal Board that undocumented migrants have been able to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
In his statement on Friday, the Attorney General of the Columbia Federation, Karl Racine, commented that the new policy "rejects the state, federal and international law for decades".
"The law of the Federal Republic requires that all asylum applications be settled on the basis of facts and circumstances which are specific to the application, and such an obstacle infringes this principle," says the Friends of Justice letter.
The prosecutors also claim in a letter that the practice of preventing asylum seekers from accessing the United States economy is damaging, because the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "import the necessary additional labour".
In June, the public prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges dealing with immigration matters to suspend the granting of asylum from victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"The safe haven is intended for persons fleeing from their homeland to race, religion, nationality or a particular class of society or because of persecution or fear caused by political opinion" Sessions announced in its opinion of 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems – even serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Suspected survivors’ rescue efforts continue in return – the number of deaths found has already doubled
The situation of survivors is becoming more serious.
"It's very tight," says the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, when she bore her feverish baby in the evacuation center in the ruined town of Palu.
"Ambulances will bring new bodies one minute per minute.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their drawn goods and try to save what is still to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and all the hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnet ramp are full.
Some of the injured ones, such as Dwi Haris, who suffer from spine and shoulder fractures, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated for continuing, powerful post-disasters.
His eyes filled with tears as he repeated how furious earthquake shook the fifth floor of the hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
" Harris tells us Associated Press, and tells me that he and his family were visiting town on a wedding day.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then came quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "prophesy" with "propaganda announcements"
The US Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool. This is happening a week after the Chinese newspaper had published a four-page advertisement in the US newspaper that praises the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid-up annex to the Des Moines Register newspaper, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of being involved in the congressional elections on 6 November.
According to the U.S. authorities that have spoken to Reuters, Trump’s accusations about Beijing’s attempts to interfere with the U.S. elections represent a further step in the Washington expansion campaign to press China.
Although it is normal for the foreign government to disseminate notifications in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a constantly escalating trade war, in which both sides will impose customs duties on the counterparty's export products on each other.
According to Chinese and American experts, the retaliatory tribunals of China were targeted at states such as Iowa at the beginning of the trade war, which supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and the long-term governor of the state of Iowa, says Beijing has done damage to the American working population, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a great exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now accelerating its provocations by publishing propaganda announcements in our free press," says Branstad in his opinion article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from the United States' respected free speech and press traditions by placing a paid notification in the Des Moines Register magazine," Branstad writes.
"On the other hand, different opinions are only seen in the newspapers of the Peking streets, and the real, different opinions that Chinese citizens can have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all. This is due to the fact that the media is strictly in China's Communist Party's drop-out youth," he writes.
Branstad continues by saying that "one of the biggest newspapers in China avoided publishing the offer" in his article, but does not specify which newspaper is involved.
Kavanaugh-fiasco bans female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
According to analysts, the fact that many of the Republican leaders stand behind and defend Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court of Justice, may give rise to a reaction, especially in the forthcoming interim elections between female voters.
The feelings surrounding the case have been on a large scale and most Republicans have already indicated their desire to proceed in the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," says Professor Grant Reeher of the Maxwell Institute at the University of Syracuse in The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republikans, Arizona)'s offer of last-minute angry voters for the FBI investigation.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday and they won't forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Advisor and National Reform Group's publicist MoveOn on Friday, according to a newspaper published in the capital city.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "the coming of November" when they expressed their opinion on the decision of the ruling Republicans in the Senate Court of Justice to proceed to the appointment of Kavanaugh, which happened despite the statement of evidence by Dr Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluable," says Stu Rothenberg, a non-binding political analyst in an interview with the news site.
"People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that is true.
But it could be even greater, especially in the case of the vulnerable female voters and younger voters in neighbouring countries, 18-29 years of age, who often do not vote because they do not like the President."
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if Republicans move forward with confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the candidate for the highest court, in which he made his claim of sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess with the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee for the NBC News channel at the beginning of last week.
"It's not just a question of the committee's vote or final vote, or of whether Kavanaugh is being questioned, about how the Republicans have acted and how they have treated Ford," Guy Cecil, the leader of Priorities USA, pointed out to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in whether they should believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh as a few majority leans towards the latter.
According to a new opinion poll conducted by YouGovi, 41% of respondents believe that Ford’s testimony is absolute or probable, while 35% say they believe absolutely or likely to be Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think that Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% say the same about Ford.
After Flake's got it all started, the FBI is investigating Ford and at least one other accusations that Deborah Ramirez made, The Guardian's report.
Ford proved that Kavanaugh had been harassing him in drunks in front of the court committee when Ford was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate revealed to him his family at the student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet attack against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, a World Wide Web inventor, has launched a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Leen open source code for Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where to keep their data and who has access to some data.
In the interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee jokes about the purpose of Inrupt's "control of the world".
"It has to be done now," he said to his startup company, referring to.
"There's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal repository" or POD.
It may contain contact information lists, memory lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal data repository is that it is fully connected to the user who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it "the personal entry into force of the data".
According to John Bruce, the company’s CEO, Inrupt’s idea is to provide resources, processes and the necessary skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Leen, Bruce, IBM's security platform, some of the paid developers working with the project, and a voluntary coding community.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website. All of this is available from this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team will not discuss "Facebook and Google whether people will be offered a complete change in which all their business models will be translated into their heads overnight".
"We do not ask their consent on this matter."
In his article Berners-Lee published on Saturday in the media, Inrupt wrote "the task of providing commercial energy and the ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new network built for Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee retains its position as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute also after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network" Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The City Remembers World War I
The city celebrates the only priest awarded by the Church of England at the Victoria Cross Medal, a soldier, after 100 years of events.
The medal of valor was awarded to Colonel Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918, following the events in the villages of Bellenglisen and Lehaucourt.
However, Vann died four days later and never found out about the highest tribute he received from the British army.
Two of his grandchildren were on display in Rushden, a parade in Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is a "active symbolic"; a memorial was revealed just 100 years after his rewarded grandfather's renunciation.
According to London Gates, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under heavy field guns and machine guns."
Later he plunged into the front row, and "with the greatest valour" led to the advance of the troops before his assault on the field alone. In the following battle Vann fell by his own hands three gun-pattern soldiers.
Colonel Vann died on 4 October 1918 – only months before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's act was "something I could never achieve from the likes of something that arouses respect."
Michael Vann He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, dropped into a blend after a parade by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it's "a great honor to take part in the parade" and added, "a great crowd of people is remembering the honor of a real hero."
Friends of the liberation waited to wake up all night in the Bellator 206 tournament – the TV channel looked like Pipsa Possua
Imagine the situation where you've been watching the expected Bellator 206 tournament all night long and not the whole event.
The San Jose event programme included 13 matches, including six main series matches, and the show was scheduled to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in Britain.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program changed from Pipsa to Possu to a great shock to spectators.
Some of the spectators were not really happy to watch all night long because of the match.
A friend of the game on Twitter opened up the replacement of the game with the drawing "Some kind of sick joke".
"According to the law, this content was not appropriate for presentation at 6 p.m., so they had to change it to a children's program," explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Marketing and Communication Manager of Bellator."
"Pip Possu, yes."
President Scott Coker of the Bellator company said that timetables will be worked out to allow British viewers to follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking about a reboot that we're probably getting the program to work on," Coker said.
"But six o'clock is there in the morning and we can't get the program presented before Sunday our time, which in turn is Monday their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed their heads, messages began to go in the direction and to the other, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
This was not the case, however, but it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that next time this won't happen.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer our fans more and tried too much.
This is a terrible situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley tells us that he feels inferior to anyone else because of his sexuality, but that motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells us that he only noticed when he came to high school that "everyone is not like me."
Lauren Laverne, speaking in the Desert Island Discs program of Radio 4, says that she has spoken about gay rights to give ‘hope’ to others.
He also tells how winning the Olympics after having a child was no longer so important.
A long-term radio program, the regular runner Kristy Young, has taken several months of free illness.
As a guest in Laverne's first programme, Dale said that she felt younger than anyone else 'less' because 'it was not socially acceptable to like boys and jobs'.
He says, "Up to this day these feelings, feel less and different, have been reality, and they have given me the power and energy I needed to succeed."
He says that he wanted to prove himself ‘something’ so that he would not disappoint everyone until his sexuality was finally revealed.
Double Olympic Pronunciationist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he is present at this year's International Games calling for the criminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The third world champion tells of his fall in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – as a "surprising surprise".
Dale got married to this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things so young" – he participated in the first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – "it's hard to find another of the same age that would have experienced similar contemplation and opposition," Dale says.
The couple got a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – and as a result, Dale's "total perspective" has changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, my life would have run around winning the gold medal," he says.
"You know, there's bigger things than a golden Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympic cult."
His son was named after Dale's father, who died in 2011 of brain cancer only 40 years old.
Dale said his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the most recent things he asked Daley about was the tickets to the 2012 Olympics. He wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he's not going to be there anymore to be in the front row," Dale says.
"I liked him by the hand when his breathing stopped. Only after the breath had really stopped and he was dead, I finally realized that he was not invulnerable," he says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew this was something I've dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of the home audience at the Olympics. There's no better feeling," Dale says.
This was also an inspiration for his first choice of songs in his broadcast – Heather Small’s song “Proud” – which aroused feelings already when he was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gets his skin into chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 a.m. BST.
Halfway to Mickelson's bench on Saturday at the Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing 47th Ryder Cup, but he must be emphatically disappointed to avoid staying in the record round as an unfortunate performance in history.
Mickelson, who plays every two years at the event to be played on record for the 12th time, transferred to the bench by Captain Jim Fury for the fourball and foursome to be played on Saturday.
In general, the center of attention of the American five-time major tournament winner now spent half a day as cheerleader and the other side of the field trying to get hold of himself.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered to be one of the most accurate drifters in his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field where a long-growing bear punishes inaccurate strikes.
If there is not enough resistance to Mickelson in the field itself, on Sunday 9th, the British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who is playing together with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, who aims to tie all four wins in the pipeline this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind 12 in the fire, get a flying start, the Michelson game may prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in the player, but what else could be said.
"He perfectly understands the role he played today. He tapped me in the back, rustled and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of self-confidence.
He undoubtedly belongs to the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he was gonna play two games.
I imagined something else, but this is how it went, and we ended up finding a solution like this.
He wants to be in that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record of the most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, which, though, was never comparable to his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk says his presence brings something undefined to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, clever, likes to joke at the expense of people, and he's a funny guy everyone likes," he explains.
"Younger players also probably had fun with him this week. It must be fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long leadership can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that before the last day’s doubles, Ryder Cup can become a rough trip.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where, on the side of Seve Ballesteros, he had a five-point lead over the Americans, but who survived as a winner on the limestone lines just and just the size of his nose and won with the narrowest possible margin141⁄2–131⁄2.
"It reminds us of how we led in Valderrama, we led in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, albeit rarely," said Bjorn, looking at the 5–3 wins in the 2018 team both on Friday and yesterday, moving to the 10–6 lead at Le Golf National.
History will show me and all other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, we're gonna shoot a big caliber.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we only aim for it.
As I have always said, I focus on these 12 players who are playing on our side. However, we are aware of what is opposite: the best players in the world."
Rejoined by how his team of players have performed in a difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I never lick before falling on such things.
Tomorrow is a completely different matter.
Tomorrow's priorities will be individual performances, and we'll talk about different things.
It is wonderful to be in the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, then the player's capacity is tested along the lines.
This is a message that must be sent to the players – tomorrow everyone will be able to achieve the best performance.
Now it is necessary to give up a partner who will also be allowed to go [to the field alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite captain Jim Furyk will require his players to perform better as individuals than they were capable of as partners. By way of exception, these are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, for his part, has experienced the full turnarounds of the last day in both directions. He was part of the team that won the Brookline before he became a loser when the European team won the "Medinah miracle".
"I remember every bad word," he answered about how the 1999 team's captain Ben Crenshaw extended his team's ranks to the home of the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medina.
When it moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have adjusted our composition accordingly and we will put the boys in the field in the way we want, as you know, we will do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the defense struggle and he meets Rory McIlroy in the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are in order to meet their European opponents next.
"I put the team's guys in this order because I think it's going through the whole tournament," Bjorn commented on his double-game choices.
The new German warship will be delayed again
The latest frigate in the German fleet should have been introduced in 2014. The purpose of the ship is to replace the obsolete equipment of the cold war, but it will not be introduced until next year due to faulty systems and explosively growing costs, reports the local media.
According to the military correspondent for Die Zeit, ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin’, the launch of the new first vessel of the Baden-Württemberg Frega class has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The vessel was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-delivery issues have been persecuting ambitious projects.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the outdated Bremen class frigates.
According to the available data, they are equipped with efficient guns, missile systems to combat aircraft and surface surfaces, as well as wireless technology, such as radar reflectivity, detection of infrared and acoustic signals.
The ship’s important features also include its longer maintenance interval – new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without going between ports.
The continuing delays, however, mean that the warships representing the top technology – which are said to improve German influence in the overseas regions – are already outdated at the time they enter the service, Die Zeit notes.
Last year, the unfortunate F125 Freegat ended up in headlines when the German Navy officially refused to take the initiative and returned it to the Hamburg shipyard of Blohm & Voss.
This is the first time that the fleet returns the vessel after it is delivered.
There is little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but in the German media there is talk of essential "software and equipment failures" which make the warring unacceptable combat tasks.
The programme deficiencies are particularly important because the size of the Baden-Württemberg class crew is around 120, which is only half of the older Bremen class frigate crew.
In addition, it became apparent that the vessel is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet's potential for subsequent updates.
With a capacity of 7 000 tonnes, Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the corresponding class ships used in the second world war in Germany.
In addition to faulty equipment, the entire project's price tag is also becoming a problem.
The price is reported to rise to EUR 3.1 billion when the original price was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of access to new frigates have arisen when Germany's maritime power has recently been warned to shrink.
Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's defence committee, earlier this year pointed out that the ships used by the fleet 'are running low'.
According to the Authority, the problem has grown over time due to the removal of old ships, but no new ones have been delivered.
He complained that no frigate in the Baden-Württemberg class could be used by the fleet.
The Environment Organisation Interrupts the Secret Life of bats
In the area above Scotland, a new study seeks to find out how bats make use of the land when hunting food.
New research is expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to guide future protective measures.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland shows that we have been monitoring the flocks of weeds and dwarf oil, as well as turrets and watersheds in the Inverewe Garden area of Wester Ross.
In the study, specific storage devices will be placed on the important points of the region in order to monitor the activity of bats during the period.
Employees and volunteers of the organisation also perform mobile measurements using portable detection devices.
The frequency of the sounds and the species concerned will be ensured by expert analysis.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report is created, where the behaviour of bats can be presented in a corresponding picture of the region.
Rob Dewar, the nature protection advisor of the organisation, hopes to reveal the main areas of the habitat for bats and how different species make use of them.
These data will help to design the habitats of the habitat, such as their creation and forest management, so that bats and related species are taken into account.
Scotland and the whole of Great Britain's bat populations have declined considerably over the past hundred years.
Construction and civil engineering are threatening the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as fly papers and certain chemicals used in building materials and attacks on pet cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, due to night hunting methods, their ears are more useful in catching catches than their eyes.
Bats use advanced echo detection techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is a rural environmental protection organisation that maintains over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares across the country – and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who carry out surveys on a regular basis, inspections of resting places and, in some cases, rescue measures for animals.
The organisation has even established the first and only protected area for the protection of bats in the Dumfries and Galloway area of the Threave Manor. Eight species of bats in Scotland are found in the area.
According to spacekeeper David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is very good for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and a very good living environment.
Not everything is known about bats yet, so our work here and in other organizations helps us to better understand what bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of checking buildings for bats before starting rehabilitation work, since the destruction of one bats can inadvertently lead to the death of up to 400 female bats and young children and the destruction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and killing, harassment or destruction of their resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the protection of bats, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn from our bats, and we still don't know how to cope with their populations."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing a legal case against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has stamped rape charges against him as "limentary" and says people want to "advertise themselves" by means of his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action to challenge the German newspaper Der Spiegel to justice.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of the rape of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at the Lasvegas hotel in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid the victim $375 000 for silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared in the Instagram live broadcast for 142 million followers only hours after the arguments were made. The 33-year-old football player strongly rejected the accusations and described them as "limentary".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today, lies," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it belongs to this profession.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the player continued smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing Der Spiegel's challenging case for the claims they have called the Reuters news agency "a valid report of doubts of privacy protection".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player claims compensation for "spiritual suffering in accordance with the seriousness of the infringement, which probably means a serious breach of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged case is reported to have taken place in June 2009 in the suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan are reported to have met in the nightclub and moved to the player's room, where he is alleged to have raped this anal, according to the papers delivered to the Nevada Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo's down on his knees after the alleged event and told me "that he was a 99% good guy," but whose "one percent" was disappointing.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed a couple of having had sex, but that it was a mutual agreement.
Mayorga also claims that he visited the police station and took photographs of his injuries in the hospital, but later came to the conciliation solution because he was "above the possibility of revenge" and concerned about "becoming subject to public humiliation".
34-year-old now says she is applying for the annulment of the conciliation procedure because she has continued to be traumatized about the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the deal to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault from Manchester United, and moved to the Italian power team under a $100 million contract to Juvento.
Brexit: UK "will regret forever" end of car manufacturing
The United Kingdom would 'repent forever' if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, the Minister for Economic Affairs Greg Clark said.
He added that he considered the announcement made by Toyota, the British department, to temporarily suspend production in his factory near Burnaston, near Derby, if Britain withdraws from the EU without an agreement.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says that the impact of border delays will be seen as a loss of jobs if it ends up with Brexit without an agreement.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota Auris and Avensis models are being manufactured, manufactured nearly 150 000 cars last year, accounting for 90% of them in other parts of the European Union.
"My point is that if Britain suddenly withdraws from the EU at the end of March, we will have to stop production," says Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of the Toyota Burnaston Unit.
Other car manufacturers in Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about the exit of the European Union in how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will shut down its manufacturing plant for a month in the implementation of Brexit.
The main concern, as reported by car manufacturers, is the risks associated with the supply chain in the implementation of uncontracted Brexit.
Toyota’s production line will be rounded by a timely JOT principle, where parts will arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers from Britain and the EU, and cars will be made on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, it can cause disturbances at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and problems.
According to Toyota, keeping a stock of over 24 hours at the Derbyshire plant is impossible and production would be interrupted.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement, which not only means success in the current situation, but it is an opportunity that we must take advantage of," he says in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"Not only Toyota, but also the opinions of other manufacturers show that we absolutely must be able to continue the series of supply chains that have worked very well so far."
Toyota cannot tell how long production would be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and serves as a trade union operator at the factory, says of the growing concern among the members: "My experience shows that lost jobs never return.
The government's informant says, "We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House will announce
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein can be "made to move another week" around the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, due to the covetous heat, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the Special Prosecutor, Robert Mueller, who, in turn, investigates Russian interference with the elections, the connections of Trump's assistants to Russia and the President's possible activities to prevent justice.
It has been reported in Washington for months that Trump's intention to fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would jeopardise the impartiality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of secretly recording discussions with Trump, as well as the possibility of separating the President on the basis of the 25th addition to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was reported to have been Rosenstein's resignation from office.
However, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York that day, so the meeting was announced Thursday.
Trump said that he would not "preferably" separate Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because it coincided with the Senate Justice hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which continued to delay the Senate plenary vote.
Trump press manager Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said, "There is no set date for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed even more, because of everything else that is going on in the highest court right at the moment.
But I always want to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists might disagree with this argument: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Newsman Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that the reason for the limited number of press conferences is due to reasons other than the disdain for the "interest-seeking" of TV broadcasters, but said: "I do not deny the fact that they are seeking attention."
Sanders, however, indicated that direct contacts between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President keeps more questioning hours than any president before him," he says, and adds further evidence without mentioning, "We've checked those numbers."
"The press is still going to be organised," Sanders said, but "it is infinitely better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We try to do this often, and you have seen us do this often over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump answers questions regularly when leaving the White House or taking part in open events or press events with the visitors.
The presence alone at a press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the President may have shown the reason for this when the journalists met in an unobstructed and occasionally strange manner.
Minister of Health wrote a letter to the Scottish National Public Health System (NHS Scotland) from the EU with regard to the fears about Brexit.
The Minister of Health has written a letter to Scottish health care workers from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for staying in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter when there is less than six months to resign the UK from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of applications for the 'established status' of EU citizens working on specialised public services.
In his letter Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, the divorce negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions to be expected in autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also stepped up preparations for possible disagreements.
I know all of you are insecure times.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we value each of our employees' contributions without regard to citizenship.
Members from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
Christine Abercrombie, a supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers team, has been in an emergency operation since the team disappeared from 31 to 27 Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports a reporter from Tennessea, Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Chief Coach Rod Reed told journalists about the injury just before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and simply got shortened to it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before placing her on the pairs and taking her to the side for further assessment.
The Tennessee State editor told WSMV channel editor Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has obtained surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center Hospital.
Harris added that "there is no information at this stage on the type/ extent of the injury", and that the Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at the Tennessee State University and plays first through the team after his Illinois move.
He had five punches on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 punches this season.
Foreign buyers will be taxed higher when they buy properties in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when they buy properties in the United Kingdom. The extra money will be used to help homeless people according to the new Conservative Party plans.
The purpose of the change is to neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters.
The increase in the excise duty will apply to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom.
Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to GBP 120 million a year – helping homeless people
Theresa May will report today on the higher tax burden on foreign buyers when they buy properties in the United Kingdom. The extra money is used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises about cheaper housing and has paid attention to income tax.
The raising of the stamp tax will be directed at people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money from this will be directed to the government's efforts to ease the pressure on the homeless.
In addition to the two-year increase in housing and investment, which was added to the current tax on stamping, an additional fee of up to 3% can be paid.
The Minister of Finance expects an annual increase of up to GBP 120 million.
An estimated 13% of London’s new buildings are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-class buyers to buy their dwellings on the market.
Many wealthy areas in Great Britain – especially its capital – have become ‘phantom cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new approach will be only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the tax rate as a means of facilitating the purchase of young people’s first homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to reject the quotas for cheap dwellings in order to correct the "hungry situation" of British housing.
Corbyn has published a series of exciting proposals to reform the housing market, including the restrictions on goats and the cessation of "confidential executions".
He would also like to give delegations more power in matters relating to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May says: "I said last year that I intended to dedicate my term to the British dream of my prime minister – that every generation's life should be better than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies located abroad, can buy apartments as easily as hard-working British residents.
Too many people have become far too far from home ownership, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team."
Sunderland's leader, Jack Ross, says that his "original goal" is to become a manager of the Scottish team at some point.
42-year-old Scotsman is excited about the challenge of raising the country’s inner corner back to his feet. The team is currently in third place in the UK’s second division.
Ross moved to the "light stadium" this summer after he had directed St. Mirren back to Scotland's election party last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play on my country's team.
I got to the second team and it was there," Ross tells the BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
“I often watched games with my father in Zampden as a child, and it’s something that’s always pulled me back.
Such an opportunity will only be accepted if I am a manager of the Society of Success".
Ross's predecessors include Dick Advocates, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Director of Alloa Athletics says he was not concerned about entering his Nominal predecessors in a Nominal Society. He has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At this moment, I have my own success in whether I can return this association to the election league.
Based on the structure and ability of the Society, it is undoubtedly part of the election league," he says.
"It's not easy for me to get in, but I'm probably only gonna think I'm successful if I'm able to pilot the team back into the election league."
Ross has only served as manager for three years: first as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in Heats Coach Group.
After that, he helped Alloa to rise from the three-series drop games and raised St. Mirren from the fall to the champions during the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever in his career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic teams.
"I was probably in a real pioneer race with my career," he recalls the time when he moved to Alloa's leadership.
"I really believed I was a better manager than a player.
It sounds strange, because I played well, made a decent profit, and was able to enjoy some of the relatively great achievements.
However, playing can be hard.
The player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I am still going through the same things, such as stress and the pressure caused by the work, but running the team seems to be just the right task.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I'm doing it as a job, and I feel better in my own body than I've ever been in my adult life."
The entire interview will be on the listener at the Sportsound broadcast on Sunday 30th September at the frequency of Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy the delinquent is Saturday at 5.30 p.m., the study will show
The summer heat wave has kicked out pubs struggling with Britain’s difficulties, but at the same time increased pressure on the food chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains grew by 2.7% in July, but the output of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
The figures composed by Peter Martin of the business consultancy company CGA says: "Continuing the sunny weather and the longer-than-expected participation in the World Football Championships meant that July was made up of pub sales like June, with 2.8% higher, whereas for restaurants the month was worse.
The 1.8% fall in the sales of restaurants in summertime only worsened in July.
The concentrated pubs and bars were most successful, and their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in sales in restaurants.
The pubs concentrated on the food also suffer from a full, but less dramatic, suffering than those in restaurants.
It looks like people just wanted to go out with a drink in their mind.
Sales of pubs and bar drinks run by companies increased by 6.6% over the month and the sales of food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman on the RSM business offering leisure and hotel restaurant consultancy says: "The results continue to follow the trend that has continued since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the main factors affecting the sale of non-home meals.
It is not surprising that the struggle for food chains continues, although the 4.8% annual decline in sales is particularly sharp now that the sector is currently struggling with cost pressures.
The longer hot summer could not have come to the worse for the food-focused operators, and only time would it appear if the lower temperatures in the sector were brought to a breathing break that was badly needed.
In July, the combined total growth in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new open restaurants, was 2.7%, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
The Couffer Peach Tracker is the next barometer for pub, bar and restaurant sales in the United Kingdom, which gathers and analyses results from 47 groups with a combined turnover of more than GBP 9 billion, which is considered a reliable indicator of the sector.
A fifth of the children secret social media accounts from their parents
A fifth of the children – some of them up to the age of 11 – secret social media accounts of their parents and teachers, reports
A 20 000 high school student survey revealed a growing phenomenon of ‘Instagram fake accounts’
The news raised concerns about the distribution of sexual content in accounts
20% of the students said they were holding a ‘main account’ that is shown to parents
One in five children, some of whom are up to 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapidly growing existence of ‘Instagram fake accounts’, which refers to the Instagram site for distribution of images.
The news has raised fears that accounts can publish sexual content.
20% of the students told them that they thought the clean-up account was for the parents to be shown while using other private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager in which she hoped to get raped, having encountered her 13-year-old daughter's secret site.
In a study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Rhtore Advisory Board (HMC), 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 held two separate profiles and half of respondents admitted that they held secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan says, "It's alarming that so many teenagers feel the temptation to set up a network where parents and teachers can't find them."
From Elidh Doyle to the Scottish Sports Government
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-member of the Scottish Sports Board. He participates in the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning general athlete in Scotland. The board president, Ian Beattie, describes the appointment as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the extensive international experience gained by the athlete over the past decade.
"Eilidh is greatly respected by athletes in Scotland, the United Kingdom and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would greatly benefit from his appointment to the government," Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I look forward to my role as a sportsman's voicepiece and I hope that I can be useful and help guide Scottish sports in the right direction."
Four American athletes, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre trips to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, who today act as a regular commentator for the BBC, lost their walking ability as a result of a transient brain disorder.
He wrote on Twitter, "A few months ago, I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
The doctors say it's only time that I see how I recover and what I'm doing.
This has been a exhausting job, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I am already training in the field of sterility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Mothers with cow-like advertising share their opinions online
The advertising, which is similar to the dairy advertising, which is made by the suckers, is shared by mothers who are breast-feeding on the Internet.
Elvie, who manufactures consumer technology, has introduced a product called "the world's first silent breast pump to wear." Its marketing is speeded up by advertising the language in the cheek and the style of music videos, which describes the freedom of a new pump for breast-feeding mothers.
Four real-life mothers danced in a screen filled with hay, among other things, with the following song I said: "Yes, I do, but I don't see him" and "if you didn't notice, they aren't the udders, they're the tits."
"Pull it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my wrists."
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused a discussion online.
77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments have raised conflicting reactions in viewers. Many say it is a joke of the day-to-day 'frights' of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows in the advertising of this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and give birth so that they can produce milk. However, their babies are stolen from them soon after birth", a commentator writes.

Another viewer commented: "It is clearly traumatic to both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their baby?"
The third comment added: "The perfect advertising of reality."
The ad also got defenders: a woman admitted that she thought she was "happy".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I took it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," says one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: "This is a fun ad that is aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in toilets) and ‘feel like cows’.
The purpose of the advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry".
At the end of the commercial, the women in the video show that they've been dancing unnoticed pumps in their bras locked.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using the breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses, and it fits noticeably inside the breast-feeding vests, which gives women freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside during pumping.
Ana Balari, the shareholder and artistic director of the Mother Advertising Office commented: "The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned a courageous and provocative entry into the market.
By breast-feeding mothers and lyphs we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump to light, we brought out the incredible freedom of the new pump in an entertaining and identical way."
The Elvie pump has ended up in the headlines before.
During London fashion weeks, two children’s mother performed catwalk designer Marta Jakubowski’s costume using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in all silence
Even though the number of migrant children on the border has increased sharply, the monthly number of cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the use of rough rhetoric and policies by the Trump administration has made it difficult to place children in foster families.
Most foster families are traditionally composed of undocumented migrants, and registering as a foster family can endanger their own residence in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other members of the economy must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs authority, confirmed last week in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the place of residence for minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Almost 80% of the people who are either members of the local family or members of their households are illegal in the country, and most of them are criminals.
So we continue to look for these people," Albence says.
In an effort to speed up the handling of cases of children, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring that, in some cases, the case be dealt with before the court within a month of the arrest, instead of the 60-day time limit previously in place, the staff of the reception centre will report.
Many prefer to take part in a video conference, rather than in a personal trial of immigrants’ affairs.
Those who are not considered entitled to assistance are quickly expelled.
According to the reports published in the reception centres and the system in recent months, the time spent in detention affects whether children are starting to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent eruptions or attempts to escape.
According to the lawyers, concerns are particularly highlighted in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of child despair can be ignored due to the large size of the institution.
They add that the transfer of children to tents without sufficient time to prepare emotionally or goodbye to them can cause trauma, and that many of the children are already suffering from trauma at this time.
Syria calls on the US, France and Turkey to leave immediately
The UN General Assembly Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been in war for eight years.
Moualem, also acting as the Prime Minister, said that the foreign troops would be in the country on the basis of an excuse for the fight against terrorism, and that 'you will act accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that "the anti-terrorism war is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and after, and millions of people have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the "holy fight until the whole of Syria has been cleansed" of both terrorist organizations and "legal foreign troops".
The United States has around 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly in training and guiding the Kurds and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has invested in the demolition of more than 1,000 soldiers.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said that conditions were good for the return and accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
"We have called on the international community and relief agencies to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They were politicizing something that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria until the end of the war has been agreed between Assad and the opposition through a political agreement.
According to United Nations diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to conduct political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia on an area of three million people.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-related al-Nusra's breast fighters, "who will be destroyed".
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene the first meetings of the new government and the Committee of the Opposition in order to create a draft post-war Syrian Constitution and set the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to the "revision of the provisions of the current Constitution" and warned that it would interfere.
Why Trump gets elected for another period
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 elections unless, as many Liberal viewers are likely to hope, his term of office and the scandal end prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential decision ever!
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.
Since 2014, the best viewing time has more than doubled by CNN 1.05 million and almost tripled by MSNBC 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and the Rachel Maddow Show at MSNBC has reached cable TV: peak readings for 3.5 million viewers on top of the news.
"This is a mess that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the lead producer of the ABC Designed Survivor program, says the minister who will become president of the destroyed Congress building.
Nell Scoll, who has experienced the comedy writer and book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club author, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trumpi.
Scovella asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Skoll says.
The cocoa has an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV programs, the news from Washington can determine how the Roe vs. Wade thing works, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other and how the world economy can do it.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond the responsibilities of the conscious citizen to look at six hours of expert panel discussion on the use of Bob Woodward's source data for Fear, on Paul Manafort's $15,000strutskin pilot jacket (Washington Post's "exhaustive hue") and on the consequences of the unadorned descriptions of Stormy Daniels' anatomy by President Trump.
For example, I can never again look at Super Mario the way I used to.
"What he's doing seems like a real TV show, because it's partly about giving the public something every night," says Wheelhouse Entertainment's director and the Panttianamo series' creator Brent Montgomery Trump's show of variable characters and daily alternate routines (NFL rhymes, Kim Jong-un's praise).
You can't miss any episodes, or you're falling off a cart.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleissi this week, he visited Long North Coast had a wonderful sunny day, but he couldn't go out because he watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not withdraw from the programme in which Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and it was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

From outside, the money flows to a tight spacer
It is not surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania has faced a real cash flow, as two candidates who have already been elected will be forced to fight for one place because of the reshuffle of the congressional districts.
This recently re-bordered Pittsburgh constituency is a challenge for the democratic Conor Lamb, which came into play in last spring's special elections.
Lamb competes with another elected candidate, the Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the old 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which is overlapping with the new 17th constituency.
The division of territory was renewed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old electoral district favored the Republicans contrary to the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17th constituency has started in the financial departments of the main parties in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became known in Pennsylvania after the 18th special elections in the Congressional district.
The site had been in the Republicans for over ten years and President Donald Trump won the area by 20%.
The political commentators have been pushing for the democrats to have a great advantage.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but retaliated
The diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and Washington's slight reaction.
President Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization Group’s management team.
U.S. Foreign Affairs officials decided to invite the American diplomatic leaders back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on the basis of recent guidelines that no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert of the Department in his earlier statement this month.
However, the penalties were only considered for El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million of assistance from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have severely affected the Central American state with a high rate of unemployment and humane crime.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity. The meeting of the same year was seen as a step in the efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
In mid-September, however, senior officials made it clear that the meeting wanted to proceed and this effectively decided on the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give the meeting scheduled for mid-October some indication of the importance the diplomats expressed for the meeting.
These three American ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic in all silence without any new bad news or punishment from Washington.
Mr Bolton's White House reporter refused to comment on the details of the discussion with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under anonymity protection.
History Teaching
The next inevitable step may be the report by a specialist lawyer, Robert Mueller, on the possible prevention of the right of President Trump, which now has very heavy evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported as a trending investigation into whether Trump’s campaign worked secretly with Russia when Russia interfered in the US elections.
If there is a change of power in Congress, President Trump will find that he is accountable to him just as he prepares to go back to his constituents and possibly be judged by his peers.
There are a lot of blasphemies here, and I do not mean to say that President Trump's loss would be inevitable - more than the loss of similar people in Europe.
We have to make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic and those solutions will determine how long this struggle will be.
In 1938 the German authorities would have been willing to break Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid years of bloodshed.
The process of history revolves around such turning points, where the undeserved progress of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What will we do if President Trump resigns Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been stoned since the announcement that he had proposed to save the President's secret speech and considered the possible inability of the President to carry out his duties.
Rosenstein says The Times report is wrong.
"How do we react if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's activities is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we voting in the interim on a Congress that considers President Trumpa to be responsible?
If we fail in these places, our democracy will be long and dark in winter.
But I believe that our success is due to my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Jew in the Czech Republic and she was expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomat.
He survived, moved to America as a migrant, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that scavenger's decorated table.
How could I have this legacy other than optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans optimistic about seeing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers face up to their home Rapid Export on Thursday, knowing that, in the same month, after a match against Villarreal in Spain, the Austrians would give a strong position to the team to join the European League G.
The bottom of the game prevented middle field player Graham Dorrans from getting to the field this season before Villarreal’s 2-2 game, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a stepping board for better results.
"It was a good result for us, because Villarreal is a good opposition," says 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game with the expectation that we could get something and brought a score with us.
Perhaps we could have caught the victory at the end, but overall, the balance is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half, and we got up to speed with each other, and we were better.
On Thursday, there will again be an important evening in the European League.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game, because their results were good in the previous game. However, I believe that with the support of this group we will be able to give everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really hard on my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The composition is good and the boys enjoy; the workouts go well.
I hope we can now press full, leave the past behind in our season and succeed."
Fear of pension savings takes women to sleep
Although participants in the study had a clear view of how they wanted to take care of themselves, only a few had spoken to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the country-wide study reported that they were discussing the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said they had spoken to their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the floor," says Deputy Director of the National Life Insurance Company Holly Snyder.
Start like this.
Speak to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them of your wishes in good time.
Talk to the professional and your family about where and how help is being obtained, as these issues are an important factor in determining costs.
Take economic advice into account: advice can also help to find a way to cover these costs.
The financing options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid health insurance for these costs, or self-cost insurance, if you have a reservation.
Develop legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a healthcare representative on site so that you can appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in case you cannot communicate with them.
Also consider drawing up a power book for your financial affairs.
It allows you to identify a trusted person to take care of financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills will be paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also, remember the small details: Imagine your elderly parent being on the way to the hospital due to a medical emergency.
Could you answer questions about her medication and allergies?
Write such information to the plan so that you have prepared for the situation.
"It's not just a financial question, who's his doctor?" Martin asks.
"What medicines are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready."
The man was shot several times with a rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times with a rifle when he walked home late in the evening.
About four-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The police describe the attack at approximately 02:30 as a "dangerous act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The victim's injuries aren't life-threatening, and the police have been appealing to eye-seeers.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a violent earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
As the communication links to the area are cross-border, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the north of the region of Dongga, which is closer to the surface of the 7.5-manditud earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated.
Key information on the island of Sulawes, in Palus and Donggalasta:
The return is the capital of Central Sulawes Province, located from a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
Earthquake and tsunami fought between the city's 40th anniversary celebrations.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometres (180 miles) along the north coast of the island of Sulawes.
The municipality of Donggala is a provincial administrative area with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The central province of Sulawes, and in particular the coastal economy of Dongga, are the main industries of fisheries and agriculture.
The extraction of nickel is also important, but it is concentrated on the opposite coast of the Sulawes, in Morowali.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, back and Donggala have hit several tsunames over the past hundred years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit the West of Dongga in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is situated in a seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire area and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunames in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in northern Sumatra on the western coast of the Indonesian Aceh province caused a tsunami on 26 December, which struck 14 states and killed 226 000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in the coastal waters of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 magnitud rush hit the island of Indonesia’s most inhabited island on the south side of Java, causing the tsunami that hit the island on the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 7.6 magnitudin quake struck Padang City, the capital of the province of Western Finland.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: 7.5 magnitud rush hit one of the islands of Sumatran Mentawa, causing a ten-metre high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The superficial earthquake struck Aceh Pidie Jaya, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the huge destruction caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was born this time, but more than a hundred people died as the buildings fell.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Lombok's tourist island in Indonesia and killed over 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence
The oldest son of the former governor and vice president of Alaska, Track Pal, has been arrested for assault.
According to the Alaskan police's Saturday report, Pali, 29, from Alaska Wasilla, was arrested as suspected of domestic violence and of preventing and opposing domestic violence in connection with the arrest.
According to the police report, Pal took the phone from his female companion when he tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in detention in Mat-Su Pretrial, and the bail sum is set at $500, report on TV channel KTUU.
According to the report, Palin came to court on Saturday and replied that he was "definitely innocent."
Palin is charged with three class A infringements, which means that he can receive up to a year's imprisonment and $250,000 in fines.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, which can be condemned for a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
Palin's not the first time he's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with the assault of his father, Todd Palin.
Back then, Palin's mother called the police and reported an assault.
The case is currently before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, Palin was accused of domestic violence involving the possession of a weapon under the influence of drugs.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of hitting his face.
Veteran groups criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 for combining her son with a traumatic stress disorder caused by a service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake struck Sulawes Island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 mannitud earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are interlinked and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit right outside the centre of Sulawes, on the north side of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
In social media, videos are going around the moment of the storm.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festivals in the city of Palu, when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal Prosecutors consider imposing a rare death penalty on a suspect in the NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York seek a death penalty for the suspect of eight human lives in Sayfullo Saipoville, a terrorist attack in New York City, which has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
According to the charge, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in his October attack on the West Side Highway bicycle road in Manhattan, where he drove on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report on the application for a death penalty in the South of York, the death penalty is possible if the prosecutors can prove that Saipov killed his eight victims "precisely" and caused "precisely" serious physical injuries.
According to the justice document, it is possible to obtain a death penalty for both of these charges.
After weeks of the attack, the federal court imposed 22-fold charges on Saipowe, including charges of eight murders to assist the terrorist organisation, typically using this term of criminality in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "remarkable planning and preparation", the prosecutors pointed out and described the way Saipov carried out his work as "serious, cruel and disgraceful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Dragon, Ariel Erlijin, Hernan Ferrubin, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the indictment states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The last time the death penalty was handed down by the law of the southern territory of New York, it has been a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last implemented in New York in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show signs of regret during the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators that his actions felt good, the police told him.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he got his inspiration after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket in his hospital room.
He's responsible for 22-point charges being innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defence attorneys representing Saipova, said the defence was the conclusion of the "naturally disappointed" prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to demand a death penalty and no recognition and life span without the possibility of liberation is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to those involved," Patton said.
In the past, Saipov’s defense had asked him not to demand a death penalty.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats says that NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable for the Brexit negotiations.
In today's demonstration against the Conservatives, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the civil army."
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentary representatives proposed that he lead negotiations with the EU.
The concertor, Peter Bone, told the marchors in Birmingham that Britain would be "already outside" if Farage were a Brexit secretary.
But May encounters between his deeply divided lines in a reconciliation with the challenge that the conservatives in the stand behind the remains, who joined in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal on top of Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as under EU pressure.
The supporters are calling on him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite a setback - and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull, he wanted to "shut up the Chequers proposal to go."
He proposed that Farage should be included and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: "I am defending Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not fight the world wars to end in subjection.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the idea that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British had changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely wrong argument."
Consertive Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march and told the journalists: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it and it does not support the members of the party or the activists who are actually going to the streets and are at all responsible for our success.
Drop the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In his message to Mayle, he added, "Ministers of State are allowed to keep their work when they keep their promise."
Farage said that politicians need to feel pressure if they are to turn a blind eye to the 2016 referendum decision.
This is now a question of trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we won't accept it."
When speaking to the excited crowd, he added: "I want politicians who are about to turn brexith to feel pressure from you."
"We are going to mobilize an army of this country's citizens, which gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-government and proud state."
Meanwhile, supporters marched through Birmingham before a two - hour event in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" signs.
The Labour Party, Lord Adonis, ridiculed the conservatives for the security problems they faced with the application of the party at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they are getting the IT systems up and running for the Canada plus plus technology scheme and unbridled border operations for free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a full farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering the presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he is seriously considering the presidential candidacy after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that it had talked about its future in the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
In November, Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, met with the Republicans Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren has been expected to run for Trumpi in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th city hall meeting with voters after Trump's beginning of the season.
One participant asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that now is the time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and it includes a woman in the highest place."
Arrest of LSU in the case of Sims shooting
Louisiana Baton Rouge's police reported on Saturday that they arrested someone suspected of a Friday shooting that led to the death of LSU's basketball team player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge's police reported Dyteon Simpson, 20, arrest at 11 a.m. at the ET information conference.
The police had published a video of the Friday shooting incident asking for help in identifying the visible man.
Sims, 20, shot near Southern University campus area early Friday.
"Wayde Sims got his head shot and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247 Sports.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted that he was present at the interrogations, held a gun and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson didn't do anything to arrest the resistance and he was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198-inch junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 starts last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recordballs per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after offering him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Lord Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that the Mercedes team arrangements are in an important position in the competition.
Bottas got a good start and left Hamilton almost his own luck in defending his spot on the first two rounds, inviting me to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit first and left Hamilton to drive a team with a tail that should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went for a tour later and returned to Vettel, but Hamilton passed by after a little contact and after the Ferrari driver restrained himself from the inside line, defending his investment after two thirds of his move.
Max Verstappen, who spent his 21st birthday, started from the back row and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the competition as he extended the exchange of tyres as he aimed for a rapid end and to take fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
He finally came in at the 44th lap, but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight laps when Räikkösen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri performed brilliantly all weekend and was a real gentleman when he passed me.
The team has done an exceptional job achieving a double win," Hamilton said.
Very poor body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim, on Saturday, that he did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter to the public, in which he accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
In his speech in Western Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee on Justice, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was an indication of 'men's irritability, horrificness and dishonesty'.
"That one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the past few days, when we see anger, people who are angry, mean, ugly and dishonest," the President said.
"When we see the publications and the things that have been laid down, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you have this information?
Do you remember his answer... do you yearn for the document... oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bleed.'
Wait a minute.
In our year, we... no, we didn't bleed," he added the senator to the bottom.
In July, Feinstein received a letter describing the charges against Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was made public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein said to the committee according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential according to his wishes."
But his ban was not acceptable to the President, who commented on Saturday's occasion: "Please tell you that that was very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the Supreme Court's candidacy, which three women have accused of sexual harassment and sought to use democratic accusations for their own benefit.
"They have decided to return to power by any means.
You see that blasphemy and blasphemy. They don't care who they're hurting or who they have to walk over to get into power and control," Mediaite reports the President said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars applied for compensation for the defeat of the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 Dundee on Saturday.
Giants had a leading position in the early stages thanks to the two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team up before Dwyer returned Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard leveled Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured victory.
This was the third Elite League kill of the season for Adam Keeffe's men who won the first round at Dundee's 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time in a period of three previous battles won by Giants.
The Dwyer opening hall came in fourth minute at 3:35 AM from Kendall McFaull's feed. David Rutherford fed when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a bold opening session, Sullivan brought home the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt entered the Cownia balancing goal at 15:16.
Dwyer secured Giant's lead at the first break when he hit the second goal of the evening at the end of the first stop.
The home team assembled its line and Bouchard repositioned the superpower at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined their powers and Nielsen managed to make Dundee’s first lead at the end of the second round. He also secured victory for his team in the fifth round in the middle of the last round.
Giants, who has now lost four of their last five games, will be next in their home on Friday, Milton Keynes.
The pilot died in order to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane escaped an earthquake.
In Indonesia, the pilot has become a hero after he died, making sure that the aircraft carried by hundreds of passengers is safe in the air.
More than 800 people have died and many have lost their way through a severe earthquake and the tsunami caused by it on the island of Sulawes on Friday.
Strong post-surrections are testing the area and several people have been trapped in the material that has fallen into the trap in the city of Palu.
Although colleagues fled their lives in the trade, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his workstation in a rousing air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained steady and ensured that Batik Air’s flight on runway 6321 was safely aired.
Then he jumped out of the air traffic control tower that he thought was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesian publicist Yohannes Sirai said that Agung’s decision could save hundreds of lives, as reported in the Australian ABC News.
Kalimantan Balikpapan prepared a helicopter to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter got back.
"This news hurts our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid of the increase in the number of victims, as the country’s disaster authorities have reported the poor connections with the cities of Dongga, Sig and Boutong.
"The victim is believed to continue to rise, as several bodies have buried in ruins and many people have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo, the agency's publicist.
Up to six-metre waves have destroyed the Tree, where mass funerals will take place on Sunday.
Military and cargo aircraft bring aid and equipment to the area.

International Red Cross Indonesian leader Jan Gelfand said in CNN's interview: "Indonesia's Red Cross is accelerating to help the survivors, but we don't know what to expect.
This is already a tragedy, but it can prove even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came back on Sunday and said to the country's armed forces in his speech: "I urge you all to work night by day so that all evacuating tasks can be carried out.
Are you ready?" CNN news.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia Air crash: According to Air Niugin, one person is missing after the aircraft crashed into the lagoon
The representatives of an aircraft airline that crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now report one person missing, although according to the previous announcement, all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it would try to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer any questions about the missing passenger's additional information, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane had hit the water when trying to land at Chuk airport.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people remained in the hospital on Saturday and everyone was stable.
The cause of error and the precise course of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy have reported the aircraft landing on the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had been driven over the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes told me that the plane had landed very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to swipe in a sinking machine in the deep water of the belt for emergency exits.
He told me the passenger crew panicked and shouted, and that he himself had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the sailors in the repair works of the nearby docks were involved in rescues by carrying people by steaming the shore before the plane sank into the deep water about 30 metres (a hundred feet) below sea level.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in the crash of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea during the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not joined the crash.
An analyst shows a timeline to the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor completed a re-treatment in which the man was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
An analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed hours as an expert witness in the field of data analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the data recorded on the cell phone when he collected together the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers' movement on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett reported that he had received multiple mobile phone location data that showed Tellis to be contrary to his previous claim in the evening of Chambers’ death, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the evidence showed that Tellis had a cell phone at Chambers at the same time as Tellis claimed to be his friend with Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford proved on Saturday that he wasn't in town on that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "is lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another incoherence was that Tellis claimed to have felt Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on data recorded on mobile phones, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," Hale said.
The final defence talks are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to proceed to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to challenge genre-related negative concepts by making music that is full of positive messages.
According to the Bristolian The High Breed group, hip hop has disappeared from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social problems.
They want to go back to the hip hop root and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a new rise in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark one?
New York Children's Nurse challenges the couple's right to a racist text message
The New York Children's Nurse challenges the couple's right to a discriminatory separation after accidentally getting a text message from the child's mother, in which she complains that she is "one of the dark ones".
The couple is arguing that they are racists and are matching the challenge of "racialization."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her shame when the new nurse Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first working day in 2016 and she became aware that this was dark.
"EIIIIIIII, REAL TUMMARY", Plasco-Flaxman wrote his husband's text message.
Then, however, he sent a message about his husband instead of Giselle Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who had made the mistake he had made, separated Maurice, stating that their previous departure passports had received an African-American nanny had done his job badly and he had waited for the Filipinos this time.
Maurice was paid for one of his working days and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation and seeking compensation for $350 per day for a period of six months, when he had originally been washed into living and working in the family, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," he said to the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The Parish has responded to the racist allegations, saying that the termination of Maurice’s employment relationship was a legitimate solution because they could not trust him after they hurt him.
"My wife sent her something she wasn't supposed to say.
He's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post interview.
"But would you leave your child to find someone you've been unfriendly to, even by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco paralleled the challenge with the blackmail and I said that his wife had had had a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Can the other man be chased in such a situation?
It's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned their behaviour and logic in the social media of the couple.
The new letter reveals that Paddington publishers were afraid that the public would not be identified with the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born a short time after the adoption of the book, says of the letter: "It is difficult to get involved in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It's funny now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
Since his father, who had worked as a cameraman of the BBC prior to his dedication to writing children’s books about toy bear adventures, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the publication of the books’ 60th anniversary felt bitter because of his father’s death the previous year.
Paddington "described as a very important family member" and stated that his father was quietly proud of its success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, not a straight guy at all," the daughter says.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; the one you're proud of, even though it isn't really your own achievement.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was about his creation, he always gave Paddington credit to himself."
I had to say goodbye on my dying daughter's phone
His daughter had been denied the plane after landing at the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save his life in vain.
"Nad called a little bit and told me the situation was really bad that he was not expected to survive," says Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called and said my daughter dies in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be right with you.
I'm with you."
Medications that allowed doctors to keep his heart running gradually withdrew from his body.
He was dead a little earlier and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing everything was going to end.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to hold myself together."
Finally, his daughter's sad loss, Ednan-Laperouse, got on the plane among other passengers who knew nothing about the trial he was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and the tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a huge compassion for Nadia.
That now he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved my daughter."
Sad women send cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and phone numbers that can be supported.
Davis's son Tyler became depressed at 13 and committed suicide at 18.
"I would not want any parent to experience the feelings I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45 in Lydney, tells us that his son was a promising cook with an infectious burn.
"He was known for his smile.
They all said that his smile lit up the whole room."
But he stopped working before he died because he felt "in darkness."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother who had taken his life from himself.
Davis says he's always afraid of post-effects.
Davis created the cards "to bring back to people that there are people who can go talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay quiet - you need to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years and he lost his partner after 15 years of togethering with Mark shortly after his mother had died.
"He didn't tell me he was down or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was all over the country on Christmas Day, and when the children opened their gifts, he did not take any eye contact with them or anything like that."
He states that Mark's death was a severe trauma to them, but they have to go ahead and explain: "It breaks up the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to keep on living and fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake at the start of his investigation
"I was thinking that if we could really achieve what he hoped for - a time-bound and limited investigation - we could perhaps achieve some unity," Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would 'depart' its deadlock caused by the supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
In opposition, it's a matter of timing.
The interim elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans' success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country will be difficult.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called the Senators to praise them for giving their support to Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report has been prepared?
A vote will be taken at the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, so Vice President Mike Pence could blow up the game and confirm his choice of the highest court.
North Korea’s number of blackouts falls during Kim’s time
According to the South Korean legislator, the number of people who had been expelled from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's seven-year old entry into power.
Park Byeong-seug cited the South Korean Ministry of Unity and reported that the accidents occurred last year in 1,127 - in 2011 they occurred in 2,706.
According to Park, the key factors were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the rise in the prices of human trafficking.
There is no public comment on Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korea's riots are ultimately offered South Korea citizenship.
Souli states that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarized zone between the Koreans.
China treats runaways as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and most often as returnees.
Technically speaking, relations between North Korea and South Korea have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on the halting negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This was followed by the historic June meeting of President Donald Trump and President Kim Jong-un in Singapore and agreed at a general level on an effort to achieve nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States for having been caught up in sanctions after the meeting.
"Without any confidence in the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis, and in such circumstances we will in no case be the first to unilaterally dismantle our equipment," Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Fears calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate in the Supreme Court
The head of the minority, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and said this was temporarily unfit for action in the Supreme Court.
You were afraid to comment on this in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called "hysterical," Mr. Fred said in his own reaction to the testimony of Mr. Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied the accusations that he would have sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford while they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in control of his feelings and between them he almost cried out and lost his ability to speak when he told his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the democratic members of the committee without calling themselves accusations against "the persecution of a Grotesque and a planner", which have organized the Liberals who were angry at the presidential loss of 2016 in Hillary Clinton.
Your fear said that your belief in Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he is not capable of acting in the highest court because it showed him to be partial to the Democrats.
"I believe that he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way in which he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," Feari said.
You were afraid to wonder if he would be brought to trial against Kavanaugh if this election were confirmed and if the Democrats would have a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified except for the Supreme Court, and he's also entitled to the court where he's currently working," Fredosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently working at the U.S. Federal Appeal Court.
The fear added that as a democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential medical reform or the Roe v. Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative justice user.
In the consultations related to its confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not a good time for a hysterical and partial person to be elected as a member of the judiciary and we would expect it to be a great thing," said your fear.
Women need to get through everything.
This is a legitimate fire speech in the wake of months and years of rage, and he is not allowed to hold it without weeping.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
He continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a way of saying to her speaking partner in a situation where she was angry and began crying:"You may think that I am now sad because I am crying.
I'm really angry."
And then he just went on.
And I thought it was genius."
Tears are justified as a course of rage, although they are generally misunderstood in fundamental terms.
One of the most memorable memories of my early work in the male-dominated office is that once I cried out of rage and an older woman - a cold-headed superior, who I had always feared a little - grabbed me from my neck and pulled me into a stairway.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they got your sorry mind."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on this presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in 1987 by a boat named Monkey Business and got out of the race, Schroeder was very frustrated that there was no reason why he would not become president himself.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven potentials and at least one more one was needed.
Someone called the situation 'The Snow and the Seven Dwarfs.'"
Since the campaign period was already long, he was behind the fundraiser and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless two million dollars were raised.
It was a lost battle.
To him it turned out that some of his supporters, who gave the men’s candidates a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was forced into his feelings of gratitude for his supporters, for the frustration system that made it so difficult to raise funds for voters and delegates, and for sexism that he could not speak.
"I could have thought I'd get a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press's reactions.
"I could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone is probably being beaten into a memorial.
"He wept."
How the US and China Trade Wars Can Benefit Beijing
A spring break for the U.S. and China’s trade war was ear-peeling, and while the battle is all but over, the inter-country crime can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China’s main export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting import goods for USD 200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded at the same level every time, most recently by imposing a customs duty of up to 10% on American import goods worth USD 60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. eye - to - eye style, and it does not seem that the second largest economic power in the world would be in a state of perplexity for a while.
In order for Washington to withdraw, one should give in to his own demands, but public worship to the United States would be far too humiliating for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing inter-country dependency.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start the economic cycle in one country, and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than the side-viewers have understood so far," says Abigail Grace, an Asian researcher at the Center for New American Security's think tank.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is "ready" for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is asking for assistance in rebuilding the country after a devastating war lasting over seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Your position is now more stable and secure thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore the normal situation.
The conditions now allow refugees to return voluntarily to a country from which they were forced to leave because of their unilateral economic measures against terrorism and their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the UN, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid in the country.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian Government would be grateful to assist in the reconstruction of the destroyed land.
He stressed, however, that the government did not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported rebels.
The European team confirmed the victory of the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup at the US team finals 16.5 against 10.5 Le Golf National field outside of France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown itself when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The U.S. star player Phil Mickelson had difficulties for almost the entire tournament and he hit his initials in the water on the 16-hole par-3 track, giving a match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari won all rounds and became one of four players, which has won 5-0-0 since the tournament was launched in its present form in 1979.
America’s Jordan Spieth came out with the result of a 5&4 European team-lowered player, against the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, ranked as the world's top player, lost 2 and 1 in England to Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European in all times at a total of 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a long year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed me.
I'm so happy to get this victory.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could be of help," said Garcia after winning the European team.
He transferred the torch to his countryman Jon Rahm, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the individual races played on Sunday.
"I feel tremendous pride after winning Tiger Woods. I grew up to admire him," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now he holds the Ryder Cup career record 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time that has won 14 big wins and remains second only to Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, the U.S. team had difficulty finding the routes throughout the weekend, with a high level of play throughout the tournament.
After a failed performance, U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We put the European team on the line this morning.
We're in the yard.
Honor Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with our American PGA and Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have to raise my hat.
We met our winner."
