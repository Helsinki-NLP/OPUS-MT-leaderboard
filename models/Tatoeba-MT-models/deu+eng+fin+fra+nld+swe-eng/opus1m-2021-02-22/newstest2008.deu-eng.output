Food debt for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area was the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 countries in the euro area, prices were higher than expected in November - after 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have been based on only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
Contrary to the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered leitzsins. It is estimated that the fall in interest rates would favour rising commodity prices and a slight fall in unemployment, leading to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB aims to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least just below the two-percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is located in the Zwickmühle: inflation had to be "agreed" in order to exclude the need for further action.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a twelve-year record high in November; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the euro area is responsible for rising food and energy prices.
The MATIF white notes rose by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also showed a significant price increase in 2007.
This year's world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent - last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but is expected to fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts will expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup Location Government Crisis
After long stagnating, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown significantly by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while according to Gallup, the approval of the socialists has reached an unprecedented low point of 13 percent.
The difference between the party's loyal voters is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71%) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) of the MSZP's consent.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are subject to the parliamentary entry penalty: they reach two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic mood has deteriorated further - never before, the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "very bad" was so high (41%), while another 46 percent consider it "very bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expect a further deterioration of the situation, with only one tenth of the population getting better.
A Gallup survey conducted in December showed that 71% of respondents - a historical high - judged the Prime Minister's work as "too bad than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán accounts for 38 percent.
Some 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of Fidesz party leader.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of people who believe that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be tackled without a change of government.
If, after the unrest of last October, 35% of the government and the head of government still voted in favour of staying, this proportion today is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) only sees the solution in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would "participate with security" and give another 20% of their vote "probably".
In comparison: if the parliamentary elections were to take place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would go "with certainty" to the urns, another 15% consider their participation "probably". In view of these tendencies, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would be against tuition fees, 79% against the practical fee, and 84% against the hospital daily allowance.
The percentage of opponents of study, practical and hospital fees would be 81, 84, or 89 per cent, depending on the group of participants in the referendum.
Also the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost one fifth
The hypermarkets in the Buda Islands trade area this year also maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Handels triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets price increases of more than 1000 HUF were registered.
After prices in the food markets were "out of it" last December, the cost has not fallen dramatically compared to the already high, earlier starting level.
However, it seems to consumers that what they had paid well under 9,000 HUF for last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 10.000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the studied markets.
The maximum price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800, the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, while prices for putenbrous fillets, nut and mohn have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were also 1kg of bread alarms for 139 forint.
There was no competitive price collapse in the product at less than 200 forint.
Also surprising here was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola panner bottle of less than 200 forint, so the drink including panner cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison, Cora cut off even the most expensive and the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora's prices in the "Napi" basket compared to last year's Christmas prices have increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive shopping basket of the current year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping basket of last year and the most expensive shopping basket of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase was still 1.206,00 forint in the previous year, but the VAT increase at last Christmas prices was noticeable.
It is precisely this process that has hit the trade badly: it seems that the warehouses were not able to decide what price range they should apply to the individual articles, because the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour was unpredictable.
(If the dealer plans a product's speed of circulation poorly, it can fall by substantial gains in the price range that is based on the traffic intensity.)
The cost of the "Napi" basket fell so radically last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the 2006 value by 1720 forint, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost more by 1.630.00 forint than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest price there was an increase of 1.284.00 forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase has occurred, the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: For some basic foods, the Statistical Office recorded a more than 30 % cost over the 12-month period.
So about flour also for eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has in the worst case increased by hardly more than 10 percent.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to turn the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trading triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; good years are constantly being reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at prices.
It is bought from all large quantities, durable food goes into pallets over the counter.
Wednesday morning morning in all three department stores there were endless snakes at the checkout when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country so that many multis complain about opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are not used
Today, more than a thousand infections were recorded in hospitals due to improper handling of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overoccupancy of the beds, the overburden of the staff - all factors that are not exactly acceptable to the control of the infections, according to the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
Disinfectants are also spared in many places.
A MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person in a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation could not be performed since then because of the bacterium that is still in the patient’s body.
By December 10, 1094, infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, according to the leading physician at the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, which is resistant to methicillin-oxacillin Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their noses without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as inflammation of the throat, mandelitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually react well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the means are administered too high or inadequately, antibiotics-resistant bacteria are produced from the well-responding bacteria, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weak, or permanently poor immune system, but also in the elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the day-to-day hospital.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA warned that there is no place where it is not sought.
Resistance to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the care professional wears rubber gloves and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment," says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are being examined for MRSA when entering the hospital, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample withdrawals too rarely
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable to curb the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and old age homes, the hospitals should investigate the patients who were admitted and isolate MRSA infected immediately.
However, microbiological sampling in Hungarian hospitals is not often practiced.
Last but not least, because there are no subsidies for this investigation from the State Health Insurance Agency.
Therefore, most cases would only come to light if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology centre.
On the European Union side, there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary to prevent resistance to the agent, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
Microbiological samples were even more rare among the ambulatory patients or those in primary care, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Savings on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most frequently transferred from one patient to another by nursing staff.
This is precisely why hand washing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in this area in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the home hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are narrowly intertwined, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 metres between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz continues to point out, unfortunately, in the financially less well-set hospitals even there is a saving on disinfectants, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that directly favour the development of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less frequent in these areas, or may stop the spread of the pathogen where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government Programme against MRSA
Taking control of MRSA infections causes the health insurances huge costs, so they are combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA or its containment was recorded in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data prove, the tendency of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Chief of Police was not drunk
In the case of a car accident with fatal outcome caused by the police chief of the XXIIth district, the official opinion is now available.
The police chief of the XXIIth district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor drug-influenced, said Attila Morvai, the press officer of the Budapest High Prosecutor's Office on Friday, after the official report was submitted to the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he was taxed.
The former chief of police, with his own car in the XXIIth district, flew into Kossuth Lajos Street, passing over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked location.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a milding circumstance - the handlebar, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, has a follow-up.)
After entering the hospital, the pedestrian is injured.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, put back his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has launched its investigations into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that from the beginning the former chief of police had cooperated with the investigators.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Finance ministers János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three EUR 400 million credit agreements in Budapest on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects, which will be implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The EUR 100 million loan agreement has already been signed earlier, the current agreement is about the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be used for the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will later be decided on in the context of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be spent on research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The metro line 4 was also discussed at the meeting.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of metro financing with the EU, the original Treaty and any amendments will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is made available by the EIB with an extension of 8 years, free of charge.
Bulgaria, the EU's property paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe looks closely at the former rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys the EU's cheapest market, but it gets faster?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently without doubt the most sought after patch for property purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Amongst the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, by the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar, however, properties around Kavarna and Balcik are also more and more in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will attract investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the extremely favorable area of Russians there are more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office areas offer highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradise, and thus attract tourists in the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter season.
So predictive investors are already buying in a big style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also striving for a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized properties by 50-100.000 euros, or coming down houses by 5-15,000 euros, which then they themselves renovate.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are widely written, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group are business people who invest with the aim of medium to long-term value increase.
Real estate in the capital is, however, becoming increasingly expensive, due to the ever-increasing demand.
Although real estate prices in Bulgaria are lowest within the EU, there has been an annual price increase of 21 per cent over the past five years.
The cost of real estate prices far exceeds the rise in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Minister of the Environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings on Tuesday end, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are advising on the Bali Roadmap, which sets emission reduction measures for the post-2012 period, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a intense debate between developed and developing countries.
The US has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue at the conference is whether the industrialised countries are willing to support developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on support for developing countries.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, expected to be read out at the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) as set out in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured by 1990 values), regardless of whether the "Agreement after 2012" would be successful or not. The Union would even be willing to use a 30% reduction if other major industrialized countries in the world, or developing countries, were also willing to fulfil their commitments in a strong and responsible manner.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, whereas the EU and its then 15 Member States had already committed themselves to a reduction of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will meet quite well, as is to be read in the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be concluded within two years, otherwise it would certainly enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which has also been underlined by the IPCC, the UN's International Nobel Peace Prize Scientific Committee on Climate Change, in its recent report.
This would slow down the reduction of emissions, and an increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, resulting in extremely serious and irreparable consequences according to scientists.
British Army throws on YouTube
units of the British army have published recordings about operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have been loading videos into the network against the Taliban, reports BBC since March 2006.
The images shot on helmets are checked at the air weapon base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such shots, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under Defenceheadquarters in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Commonwealth Office and the International Peace Forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has released the videos aimed at recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the public about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
Propaganda of this kind was almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message in themselves, as they confirm the existence of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
Americans Advertising with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur shots, which in addition to the carefully edited, censored shots also create a net - such as those showing the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films we talk about the losses at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, by the way, numerous video footage have already been uploaded to the platform, but this "gene" has only recently been discovered by the British.
The Americans, however, are competing in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "American Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less lifelong simulation.
Christmas with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means climid: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a work conference where her employees can finish 2007 with coffee and pogats.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other magical Christmas atmosphere with Tombola or incited officials.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - so celebrates the power.
The Christmas fever has already covered the offices.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held this year in the Defence Department, but the Ministry's employees are not expected to do so.
At the "Weihnachtsfeier der Waisen" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "Missionfeier" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The office provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport beat the strands.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the house of the future, with about 350 of the 600 employees expected.
Although the focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a Tombola draw.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The room rental amounted to 1 million forint and the rest was spent on the more than 400 guests charged.
According to our information, one NFÜ department is also invited to another Christmas celebration, which is organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU countries.
For the celebration the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not achieved the responsibilities.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFC, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OI for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
On request of [origo] they said: There was no ball dress or suit obligation on the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government prepare each for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees on its own four walls for about 400,000 forints.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not at all to a Christmas party, but to the annual conference.
It is calculated with about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only hosted with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration goes out with 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Self-Government, will simply start with his colleagues in the ministry's lobby.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall, with 436 employees expected.
The expenditure was measured at 2,500 forint per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent incendiary.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the staff of the PM have been celebrating each year in this way.
However, there will not be a proper party atmosphere - not only because of the official speech of the minister, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites a New Year reception on 20 January, the Ministry's Christmas celebration will be held this time.
The one hundred guests are invited to Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget") and according to the information of the resort, the expenses are measured by 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception to which foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held each year, traditionally begin with a brief speech by the minister and sound with restraint.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
Asked for the costs of the Christmas celebration, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not provide information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held in the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The league unions and the Hungarian trade union federation will form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite duration of the strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the cessation of work begins.
Strike-related, significant traffic barriers are expected, as rail transport is almost completely discontinued, and Budapest public transport (BKV) strikes until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly on Friday afternoon by the League Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions.
A LIGA - MOSZ Strike Committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest assembly will be held, and from Monday onwards, all organisations that have joined the strike will settle the work for an indefinite period of time, unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
Should the National Council not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees meet to advise on further action.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will take place only in the later evening hours, or at midnight.
The strikes that begin on Monday will have to be expected to lead to significant traffic barriers: the railway companies will be laying down their work for an indefinite period of time, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will remain silent.
At the same time, there will be many motorway blocks in one direction.
The call to strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organisations announced strikes at an indefinite time, while others plan to stop working on a temporary basis.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of Railways VDSZSZ on adequate services, even though more and more people are travelling by rail on Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, from the start-up to 1 p.m. of the BKV, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, the LIGA Energy and Electricity Unions are putting down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union e.g. the Democratic Teachers' Union has called for 2- and 2-8-hour strikes.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians strikes at varying times throughout the country, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Workers in Health and Social Services, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the league is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second is the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model due from next year.
Claim number three means that the eligible occupational groups will be able to access the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that VDSZSZ, a member of the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer made by the Ministry of Transport concerning the ancillary lines and is now calling for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August this year with the support of the "Move for a Better Hungary", have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
Among other things, the Institute's "Risiko-Warnings Report" states: "In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the exacerbation of existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy populations in Hungary, which could lead to violent ethnic conflicts even in the short term".
The main reason for this is the Hungarian Guard's strategy, which is probably aimed at the provocation of such a conflict, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure by the politicians: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian concept".
It is assumed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least because of the enormous attention of the local and foreign media, "have significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006 the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been on the rise continuously, so that since summer 2007 several organisations called "national self-defence associations" have been founded.
"These groups are common ground that they define themselves as a civil organization each time, openly boasting to prepare their members for their defence tasks, sometimes armed, (disaster protection, defence, orderly treatment), calling on the inability of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further on: All this is done in accordance with the method that tries to label different political aspirations as a bourgeois initiative based on the political and party dryness of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association are therefore not just intended to avoid legal obstacles that might arise as a result of the registration at court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months the Hungarian Guard has been quoted as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, as some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this has an impact on the region's political stability.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an individual phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard stood the Roma mass riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
BNU took the incidents immediately as a reason for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organization was "national protection".
In her opinion, during the last 17 years, a real “gypsic terror” has been felt in Bulgaria, but the state has remained silent and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
And further, the initiative would have started a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Roma, too, with the organisation of their own protection, react to the threats, it is stated in the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published and risk-changing trends should be recognisable, the public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the publication of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere Holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated precisely by law, so that the practice of redistributing working days around the holidays has now established, but the coming year gives us less such days.
Also in the EU and in America you can understand something else under "Fair Day".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and job-free days.
Job-free days are mostly ecclesial holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we are celebrating New Year's Day: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone can rest the New Year's Eve celebrations.
We have a total of fourteen holidays all year round.
The state celebrations are the 15th of March, which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the foundation of the state, on May 1st, the work is celebrated, on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day shift" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be completed, the Minister of Labour has for a long time been laid down in his own regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants.
Exceptions are only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on holidays.
This year the working order is only mixed up by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in this country remains formal, since most take the special holiday for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve.
In the next year, there will be more holidays in the middle of the week or at the end of the week, so that there will be fewer re-dispositions on working days than this year.
The calendar is first placed "on the head" around the day of work so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday April 26th will be a working day so that Friday May 2nd will be a day of rest.
The second redisposition will be related to the holiday on October 23rd: On Saturday, October 18th, one will have to finish on Friday, October 24th in advance.
The end of the year will, however, remain in the sign of the holidays, after everything will be and will remain, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to annoy colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, language messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The question is simply whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or you better face up to the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings knowingly for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it right again by perhaps calling the marketing department and confessing with remorse that you would have forgotten to send out the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's off with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should think about what you can really do for your colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrowing out something that doesn't belong to one's own?
There's hardly anything more nervous than to grab a document, office accessory, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the lifting device was still on the desk - today it's gone early?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without a question, you should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has gone away.
So, no envelopes or post-it are put in the pocket from the office, because it could hit a self: none there anymore, if you need it urgently.
What about the private lives of colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a move that has already been put into the world.
Who did what with who?
Where and why?
One should not, as far as possible, bind the information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues to anyone's nose!
And if anyone opens up and tells us his inner secret, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave, instead of directing those who are not present at the moment, even if others know about the problems of their colleague.
Is there no reason to be ill?
If you call the office to report sick when calling for painful headaches, because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, unmovable executions, projects with fixed dates must now be done by colleagues rather than by yourself.
So don't play too bad with the co-worker!
If you already know the day before that you will not be able to get it into the office the next day, or that something could get in between, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Total, quivers, phone calls
One is deeply involved in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the Members' loud mouths?
Unintentionally heard a phone call you shouldn't have heard?
You shouldn't make the colleagues nervous with soms, singing, loud conversations (which you cross over their heads), kickbacks, constant squandering or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not in depth in a task (write, plan, organize).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not completed in due time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best one is to admit his mistakes and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or how to recover the failure, is only too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training shoes and sleep: Comfortable for home, but didn't lose anything in the office!
Not even if the workplace were actually to allow it, you should dress up more casually.
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress in the office - if you wish, also pretty and elegant!
They all want to make it right - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has not spoiled us with qualitative electropop for a long time.
But now you can even see the traffic jam differently when you hear the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock is "in" with its guitar set again, the home electropop proves: there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer has started in Pécs, playing himself in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a inn doesn't carry two pipers - started to walk his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, was only achieved when he was approached with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"Szezon" von Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" gave its first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, named it the almost only trend setter in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but there was no interest in whether they like to wear this brand.
The band has reacted as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album, entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead", which has now been released, could open up new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time that Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but next to the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar, the influences of the rock'n'roll - corresponding to the spirit of the times and trends.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it a radio hit - the mr2 Petőfi, who has been sending pop music since the news from early to late, has succeively set the earworm to the listeners with the song "Wings of Love", which has been recorded with the help of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So you're all right.
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far does your music remain reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "skin music" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and non-sight, but they can also only be produced for sale, which makes it commercial music.
Also a good pop number can arise from an honest motive.
The listener's willingness to listen also works independently of languages and national borders according to this principle.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In other countries, especially the western part of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or twens going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more attentively, because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us music does not arise to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn there are only intractable changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed one thing: if you want to do it all right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has more of a career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, let alone try to interpret this into our music again and again.
We see ourselves as a team player who rely on the musical presence of the other and allow them to unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" stands first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged in the direction of a wider audience with a slightly more popular style?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then hold as a drawhorse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be the final of the album with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just her, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir of talented soloists from the local music scene.
Thus the six-member choir was created - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth - which we later baptized "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Do you want to have the song the same way, or did the girls shape it?
B. Zs.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material was ready for the album, we thought that this number still needs "something".
The chord sequence formally demanded a voice.
I sang the melody the same night, and later they learned the girls.
Everything came to a close and frighteningly spontaneous.
I remember being electrified at the time, but it's already required the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: On the record, as well as at the concert, the impression was that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo party (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, they sing together perfectly and aren't louder than the music, so their vocals are not just accompanied by the music.
They were also on stage.
Is it intended?
B.C.: That they stood behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not want to give them any solo roles.
The point is also that one should forget about his ego a little, forget who is coming from where and where to go, let us simply allow us to lift up these particular wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came into being.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical work actually none at all, there have been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work any longer, but gradually everything came together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and now that I have "lost" the album.
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the song "Never The Same".
Confidential brokers risked billions because of inferiority feelings
Groundless scammer
For example, his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, is the owner of the local Komerční banka, the French bank giant Société Générale.
It came to nearly five billion euros because of it.
But it seems rather that Ker Much was only a big player who wanted to do the same, was certainly not incapacitated beyond that.
Unlike all major bank houses, he recognized the crisis in time on the American mortgage market.
"He's more mentally weak," he heard from his superiors who showed him to the police.
However, as is apparent from Kerviel's statements published by the French media, such as the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a person who had won 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year's business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros just in the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already initial news that so-called sub-prime hybrids, such as low-income customers or those who had pre-deposit problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Ker lot didn't believe that and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profits to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain that," Ker Much admits and continues that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has faked documents so that he can't be put on the rails.
He even succeeded in leading his bosses back into the light, even though gradually the Eurex stock exchange was interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
Its annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"In my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kervoll explained to the investigating officers.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by placing half a billion euros on price losses in the London bombings of this title.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you
"This is like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses allegedly knew about everything, or suspected it.
"As long as I earned money, they closed their eyes."
But then at the beginning of this year came the big blow.
On a single day, he lost one billion euros.
On a weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to balance this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer a bank employee.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they come to him on the blasphemy?
He was suspected of having a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to look at him in the cards," Kervalu said.
The Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
It is about half the amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be allocated about 100 billion crowns from the programme "Company and Innovation".
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase by 90.8 billion in line with the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be available next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to attract funds for innovative businesses.
The aim is for companies to gain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in the current EU funds acquisition.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20 years imprisonment for ex-presidents
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty-year imprisonment of former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (beinahhe 1.8 billion crowns).
But later he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the news agency AP, whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes back behind bars is currently unclear.
According to Ileana Pérez, the president of the Court of Appeal, it will now depend on the prison officials whether they allow Alemán to sit down at home or whether he has to go to jail.
A court proved four years ago that Alemán had regularly moved money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Budget is made up of:
Yes, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which has been adopted without the support of the opposition by the majority of coalitions.
The one for the current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented him, and therefore the ČSSD could not allow itself to reject him.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, there was nothing dramatic this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-regarded, yet very important law in all its rest.
That is, to a certain extent, paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is obscured by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more thankful subject for the media and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute between politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The state budgets of the past Social-Democratic governments were under three weak points, which the 2008 budget cannot be eliminated at once:
The first is the high proportion of legally binding expenditure, which is not only about pensions, but also about social expenditure, which the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the municipal budget deficits.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and, in some ways, under control.
But a real time bomb is the household deficit of the congregations.
Many mayors, apart from revenues from taxes, taxes and bank loans, issued additional sources of investment, often unconsidered bonds, which they owed to an excess of their townhouses.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts through massive sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks that they had received from the state on the basis of privatisation.
Now this source has already been changed.
As far as we are concerned only with official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy has been growing for some years, like the rest of the world, and the ČSSD is famous without fail.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonably than our Republic.
This is a huge shame that is mainly attributed to the former governments.
We are among the least threatened countries on a global scale.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which have, unfortunately, been inflated to a huge extent in recent years.
Although it has succeeded in abolishing some of the unintentional populist issues that were passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if it does not come to a shift in the retirement age and a reform of pensions in the near future, virtually any policy in this country will end, and whoever is in power will remain for him nothing but pure administration.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that ruling politicians then become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenues into pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure through compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of SEK 70 billion planned for 2008 would certainly be superfluous if previous governments had not spent what was going on in the last ten years.
If we do not want it to really happen that ruling politicians become purely administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware, however, that the state can spend only as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees, wishing to rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these enable the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.
Ji the Krej the Krej
Banks want to deal with the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on financial markets.
For example, more than 100 billion dollars will be auctioned on the currency markets.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to borrow each other's money.
For example, the American Fed sends 40 billion dollars on auction, another 24 makes it easy for the European and the Swiss central bank.
It is the first time, after the attacks of 11 September, that the central banks of the individual countries have agreed on such a coordinated approach to the defence or mitigation of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is designed to eliminate the greatest difficulties in the economy, that is, the growing lack of free capital that banks can give," wrote Bernard Baumohl, a consultant from Economic Outlook Group, in a report for his clients.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion, especially in the United States, due to unserviced loans.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can still be done when they decided to do this," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, their customers' loans will also be more expensive.
This would reduce consumption and bring the American economy into recession, possibly with an impact on global economic growth.
The central banks have decided to do so after they have failed to lower the so-called LIBOR, the interbank interest rate in London used for lending between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow each other money, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and the UK had reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks contributes to the heating up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Ecologist debates are incredible
Global climate change is said to affect developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus again expressed himself on the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the outcome of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet", he explained that the debates of the ecologists are unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which represents a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompanied and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word-fire that only replaces a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed in his presentation of his book that his topic was very important to him and therefore he was so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often encounter caricatures of my views."
So now interested parties can constantly read his attitude.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but he felt that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He was finally academic, able to understand and assess professional treatises, had experience with statistics and was also a economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no consistent opinion among scientists on global warming that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and thus do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose other unproven views, he sees this as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions from those present he repeated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who ignore the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had already spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600000 motorists missed the deadline to exchange their old driver's license, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day on which to request the exchange so that the authorities will be able to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will travel on the roads without a valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have exchanged their driver's license.
While small towns report a strong fall in interest in the early exchange, the offices of the capital are being overcast with requests, and the interest in the exchange was still growing this week.
The city administration produces around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, approximately 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver's license.
The exhibition will take 20 days for a new driver's license.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver has to pay 500 crowns.
Motorists who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license will be liable to a fine from January onwards.
The evildoer pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
The police, however, can also use an exhortation during the transgression.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the congregation may also impose a penalty on the person who does not drive at all.
He could, it was said, threaten a punishment of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry already called on the authorities to allow mildness to prevail and impose a penalty of 1000 crowns at most.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, however, nobody threatens a thousand crown penalty.
The driver's license is a document in which everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It is not about a identity card that everyone, and indeed a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driver's license.
It is sufficient to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalidated.
However, the motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to change.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, these are about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko theok, who are accused of having done a joint cause with the gangs of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years of imprisonment.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Oberlandesgericht, which reduced its penalty by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Amts for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years, respectively.
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only a review at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused in this case, but he is first faced with the first instance judgment.
In other trials, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
That's all he can be sentenced to.
In January a district court accused 19 people mainly of involvement in robbery, the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
From the outset, most of the defendants contested the charge on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police provided information from police sources in consultation with, inter alia, Berdych Offenders, covered various robbery and helped gang members escape prosecution.
The gangs handed over Opava and Ko for 30 percent of the spoil.
The charge concerns crimes committed by the gangs from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robbery, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also presumptuousness and unlawful possession of weapons.
In the case of house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser remote tube and a machine gun.
According to the charge, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns due to its robbery.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts of Berdych and a number of others found further robbery to be guilty by law.
Other men from Berdych's circle must be responsible for another trial, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main proceedings have so far been conducted by Tom the Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish detention and who are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - invoice: 12 million
The lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million crowns of compensation and court fees for the replacement of children in a detention clinic.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers two million each and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore completely disagrees with Velebas' proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too high," said Dostál after today's negotiations.
"But in order to be able to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the opposite had been drawn up.
We'll find out if it has any meaning at all.
But we believe that this should be in the hundreds of thousands range for all," said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the Jablouov family wanted a million crowns for each month that they had not raised their biological daughter.
Veleba was the basis for compensation negotiations, which he had prepared for the University Hospital in Prag Motol.
The parents of the children, according to experts from the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depth.
The men betrayed the stress situation better, even if they saw accusations against them, they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, deal with the consequences of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
On 9 December last year, Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the prison clinic in Třeb the hospital.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablo theov.
At the end of October, the head of the district of Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhr) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by the fault of the hospital in Třeb the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally liable.
In case of doubt, they must access a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they apply to the institution for assistance.
The courts have so far admitted relatively low amounts of compensation, the amounts have been determined by tables and have been in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came to his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the battle for the brand "King Walachei".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tom the Harabš in cooperation with the actor in many years of work.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably file an appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka's parasitic," said Polívka's lawyer after the negotiations.
Everyone presented themselves with the words "Walachisches Kingdom" just this actor and comedian.
The same opinion is also expressed by Harabš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money acquisition and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is a dispute about money.
"After years, they noticed that the project is successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win parasitics at our work," he continued.
Lukrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993 the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
At that time, however, this was not related to the intention to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabš came to think of spending walachian passports.
A business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized out of an initially fun action, to which Harabš then joined the establishment of the company "Walachisches Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in passports and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabš only used the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the "Manege" show for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"Popularity Polívkas certainly helped the project of the Welsh Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabš project was and his team who had devoted themselves to it intensely.
The cooperation of today's disputing parties lasted until 2000, when Harabš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabš have begun to accumulate, which culminated in the defeat of "King Boleslav I elected until the Day of Sanctity".
The leading role was then used as Queen Mother at the suggestion of Harabš Jarmila Šuláková.
In 2002, Polívka filed an action against Harabš and his company, which today dismissed the court.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the contest prepared by Harabš around the throne and half a princess.
A new king should emerge from this.
He didn't want to betray details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to overstep anything.
It should be something like the king's move in the Walachei.
The king was to be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also sign up quietly," added Harabš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Drain vanes
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much worth, the quality of the gear circuit, the steering and also the processing could be described as less than average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The combination called SW is a bit further, and I'm only left to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of headroom on the back seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the combi is designed in such a way that not even two-metre men will suffer.
Move fast.
I only go through the interior briefly not to repeat myself too much.
It is quite a successful design, where I have only objections because of the ugly middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more designer design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times when we might complain about too short seats or head restraints.
The side structure has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As far as space supply is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the combi, too, the already mentioned lack of head freedom is eliminated.
The suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car is the loading room.
I must label it (also because of the folding back window) as very easy to load and space-saving.
The vaults are equipped with straps, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and also hold onto heavier objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi, sold in the Czech Republic.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mladá Boleslav product, we find that the Peugeot is clearly 52 litres behind.
This value is already critical for a foreign holiday or when loading a stroller.
But in order to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading space or the very low loading area after folding the back seats.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a engine capacity of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And frankly, this should be a 1600-cube engine that drives a family-hatchback.
He's quiet, has a low level of consumption and moves away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart with Škoda, who sometimes seems to be stuck in his exhaust with a note, then I can only be impressed by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
However, we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine of 329900 crowns is still going on.
With our engine it costs 410900 crowns, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car is added to the beech with 80,000 crowns.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper trigger, electric rear window lifter and...
So the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but once you're expecting the additional equipment of a Fabia and you're going to arrive at a very similar amount.
So only the decision which brand you want to choose remains.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is not successful
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, causing local fears for the further development of local schools.
The integration of Eastern Europe has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even note cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the disputes between the indigenous and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and looting among pupils have focused on the relationship between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended herself with the boy insulting them with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed up to a bush and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then bare his buttocks," one mother of Slovak students described another unpleasant incident in The Times.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming more and more tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks have been reported who came here looking for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak students are therefore visiting British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will be fulfilled if you just select the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters that offer pizza on the beach, ice cream and seductive cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to a great extent.
Only on one island can you find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that ever saw a human eye.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spanish had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the prohibition) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rises grew, across the wide boulevards, cars that were among the cult symbols of the 1950s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had been hunting.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar in the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana until today, because the once imported Shigulis and Fiats in the salty and damp air have long since fallen apart.
If Havana, especially its oldest part, has fallen sharply, there are nowhere around as many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a Marotte that is unique in the world and attracts especially railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and the same driven narrow tracks to the sugar factories.
Its fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers are somewhere else in the museum.
Excursion targets
The majority of the visitors to Cuba are not excluded from the most important places.
So you don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
Just mention that in the already mentioned Hemingways estate there is a museum whose visit should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
The lush vegetation grows on lime floor.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rose steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities gathered fertile soil, through which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense growth.
This valley is where maybe the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was shot there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Beauty and wealth brought her to trade with slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the tasty beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was still no road there in the fifties of the last century that had connected the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it was ignored.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Tal of Sugar Factory".
In the evening one should then go to the Casa de la Música, which is lively after the darkness, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This town in the east of Cuba is known as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads that lead from Guantánamo must overcome high and cramped mountains and pass through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
Thanks to its unspoilt nature, this eastern outpost of Cuba was included in its World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, the church shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it has been created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands are several table mountains of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, about the sanctuary of the Cuban Patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, about all that you could write many pages.
But, as one says, look better with one's own eyes.
Ally in Afghanistan are passive, claim Americans.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO was to draw up a concrete plan for the coming years, according to the words of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.
The mission to Afghanistan did not run according to its ideas, but in Edinburgh, Scotland, the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of State Robert Gates, called on NATO units to become more active, Britain sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"A forward development is noticeable in Afghanistan, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to begin their own economic and security development," says the BBC's British Minister of Defence Des Browne.
Ninety percent
According to the American Army, the activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level for five years.
Compared to the previous year, the number of violence has increased by 27 percent, even by sixty percent in the southern province of Helmand.
The NATO countries have stationed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
They specifically demand additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly today the Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, expressed himself.
"I am not pleased with what we have at our disposal to land and air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of Reuters Agency to conclude three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
In recent months, among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute as to whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, because of passivity Germany was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting demands for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" called this week the German soldiers a vulture.
"Afghan nonstudies detangled: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German image magazine went on to counterattack and printed a picture of a British unity in a rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech Republic has a state debt of 84,000 crowns.
Total debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe itself this year with 159.2 billion guns.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of public budgetary policy.
The Czech Republic's government debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they thus increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on government debt from the beginning of October.
Every Czech has a debt of 84,000 crowns.
Over the whole of last year, the state owed more than SEK 111 billion.
"Up until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of a trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should range from 900 billion to a trillion crowns," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analyst of Next Finance, says: "We could come to exceed a trillion in 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we don't know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I'm not going out of such a change," he remarked.
Debt growth
The government's debt comes from the government's debt and comes mainly from the accumulation of government deficits.
The government debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic debt has now increased to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The state's foreign debt has increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and declined by 13.7 billion crowns since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first quarter to the third quarter, which is really a lot in view of how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the increase is particularly marked in debt securities where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of government debt for 2007 show that the government planned to absorb SEK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, thanks to the improved fiscal policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to SEK 152.8 billion.
This amount is mainly due to the general government deficit, which will obviously reach SEK 76 billion this year instead of the estimated SEK 91.3 billion.
In addition, there are a maximum budget allocation for the consolidation agency of SEK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion, and a EUR 1.8 billion bond rate for the European Investment Bank.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was brought to a trial in Khartum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused in Sudan of insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Thursday evening by a court in Khartum and subsequently expelled.
The British were accused of allowing students from six to seven years of age to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She should have been plucked out.
After parents of students had complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture several times, 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School in Khartum, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter takes place in September when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to select a name for the classenteddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school principal Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favourite first name.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the photo signature My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not carry a sign with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is seen as insulting Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything that could lead her too close to a religious faith, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, his opinion is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by numerous students of the teacher who describe them as very attentive to their pupils and as a person who never speaks in the class about religion.
Remember that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given name in Britain, for which 14 different writings exist in English.
This nickname, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of veneration to the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can we give him a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiation meeting in Vienna on Wednesday.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo finished a sixth and final discussion on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy over the future status of the Separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, explained the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace is at stake in the region, the American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina called for their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of proceedings on 10 December
The Troika mediators, who unite the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since last August's Troika had been commissioned by the UN for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council, are continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
Russia was and remains a advocate of a negotiated solution, a mutually agreed solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of Kosovo's leadership by the UN, the Western countries maintain EU-supervised independence as the only solution for the future.
Pristina is ready to announce this one-sided if the Security Council is not to decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, announced by the President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Hotel in Baden, where since Monday these negotiations have been held the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province shared his regret.
He added, however, that the plan proposed by Belgrade for the autonomy of a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it particularly fears a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken solely and solely in the Security Council, where the Russian ally holds a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only one decision from the Security Council series is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council.
To the journalist, Fatmir Sejdiu replied that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word on the status, and added that any unilateral declaration of independence would be made by the Albanian speaking population in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush withdraws an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference, which was held in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must cease its colonization work, Bush said, recalling the two parties' commitments to the road map for peace, which they had agreed to in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas were, in the end, seeking a peace treaty that would clarify all outstanding issues without exception, including the central issues.
This term covers the three serious problems that the conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians are primarily about: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the present state of Israel in the course of the 1948 conflict.
According to the American President, Abbas spoke and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations should be conducted in a comprehensive and thorough manner and provide for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he undertook that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to put an end to these negotiations before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two states, a Palestinian one and an Israeli one, which are side by side, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has announced that it received Bush's assurance in this sense of Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan adopted by all Arab countries to offer peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks on the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi Arab prince says in his interview with the Arabic-language newspaper financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are opposite.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of investigations by the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), a police car on Rue Louise-Michel headed for Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m.
He had no deployment, but was on a strip, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a spokesman to the police.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without authorisation, thus not released for public road traffic (see below), was driven at very high speed by two young people without helmets.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had ignored its driveway from the right, a police officer continued.
The alcohol checks carried out on the vehicle passengers are much negative.
The condition of the car (bullyed cot wing, split windshield, broken bumper) is evidence of the rigidity of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the Attorney General of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation report on the "facts of involuntary personal murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in agreement with the Head of the Government for Public Safety at Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor declared that she excluded the investigation of the IGPN at this stage from the responsibility of the police officers.
According to the Magistratin, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely, that this small-power wheel arrived relatively quickly on its left side.
Yesterday showed a kind of rivets, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, that the two vehicles had remained stuck in each other until the police managed to brake it.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were obliterated yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumour quickly made the round, which meant that the police had left the scene very quickly, without helping the two young people.
Although the IGCN remains very cautious, it would also exclude any serious error in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations for which further investigations are needed, and where very careful action is needed.
Libération has met an eye-witness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital to try to revive her, says this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed cop hanging out.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths who called the fourth.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the events and, as it seems, because of the certainty that the persons present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police of colleagues who arrived at the scene of the accident were taken in the car.
According to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow the claim that police forces did not help young people.
These young people have been given the first help.
The fire department has arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, stressed the state attorney.
In Pakistan, tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police launched the first demonstrations since General Musharraf had called the emergency.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the eastern part of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency had been injured by the tear gas grenades that used the law enforcement forces there.
Those then threw stones with which they hurt the cops.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios were found in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by opposition officials, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning the roads leading to the Supreme Court had been blocked in order to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations would have been held in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyer movement received on Monday the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance of Menishida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president called on the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken out against the emergency, and to the waste that had sworn in before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly concerned by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
On the following days he had to refer to the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, declared the Magisterium of the newspaper The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to issue the Supreme Command over the army and to become a civilian president is no longer valid since the call of the emergency, declared on Monday the Vice-Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would give his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term of office as President ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the rumours that were persistent in the country, according to which President Musharraf had been granted a residence by his deputy commander.
Still more than a third of pregnancies are not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of use of the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
At any rate, eight out of ten births today were carefully planned.
For one of five pairs even on the month exactly calculated, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the occupation of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector indispensable for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A daring exit, which due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools equipped by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had downloaded the Harmony module from Space Shuttle Discovery, a large cylinder-shaped part that will soon be taking in the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module lab.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5 tonne module for power generation via solar panels already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew engaged in the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can unfold like accordion, was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one metre
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who originally left the space ferry Discovery for a control passage and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been installed at the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best space walkers.
Large, resistant, very clever, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old learned doctor was thus chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut through the wrong cable and fixed some kind of rail on the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey baton, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric blow on the solar panels that produced several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station conceived and built.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation, before today seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery to expect to take the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS on the stock market sanctioned
After the Aviation and Defence Group announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion to counteract the A400M residues, the share of EADS is currently showing a marked decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% on the Paris Stock Exchange at EUR 21.96.
The Group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 with reference to the residues caused by the slow-moving development of the A400M engine, which delay the jet flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results, he added without further detail.
The Group also indicates that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month backlog.
As a reminder, the business performance of the EADS fell from 86% in 2006, mainly due to the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of status quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting to count the urns: the mass of Russians will decide for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her desire for stability, and even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to voters who have already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He is doing this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kreml party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President did not allow anything to be seen when he received the foreign ambassadors and was pleased to provide a new attack point against the Western powers accused of interference – his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without cheating, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have torn themselves there.
She denounces an election struggle that has been suppressed.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder had been sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized protesting, according to his lawyer continued to ban visitors.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these Parliamentary elections without tension, two far-reaching questions arise:
Who will take Putin's succession as president?
The official newspaper yesterday announced the date of the first presidential elections, 2 March 2008, with the candidates having time to make themselves known by 23 December.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive term.
And now there's no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the majority of Parliament and of the all-powerful United Russia Party, which will elect the government and the President?
Whatever it is, it will triumph in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, which will triumph in the past power.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not master of their destiny, according to sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre of Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St Petersburg State University even goes back further: bourgeois society has developed only very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized five centuries after Europe, and the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin again attached himself to the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism did not follow terror, but rather a certain economic prosperity, according to Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians, out of their free will, renounce the personal responsibility which they have shown for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
Thinking about what for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to keep the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often similar to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion by Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old professor: What can be considered for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why do they replace them?
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed in Bad Arolsen for a total length of 27 km, could not be viewed until now, unless with a humanitarian purpose, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. on request of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been in force since yesterday.
_Other Organiser
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to carry out research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced workers, explains Reto Masters, director of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public due to the delicate nature of certain information.
Like, for example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The detention lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo were assembled for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent staff work on tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, some of the scientific community has limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
We must not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, according to Dr. Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to achieve a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, trade between India and Europe already reaches 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission's figures India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade agreement will greatly advance the two economies and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans , confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants trade goods worth 47 billion euros each year and services worth 10 billion euros, said this week Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, and regretted that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India will meet on Friday at their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England notes the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about limiting the current recurring concern about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
In order to mitigate the fears that the financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty as to the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at this time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , it states in a communication .
The Bank further states that 10 billion pounds (EUR 14 billion) of GMT will be put into circulation on 6 December, at the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that BoE has launched liquidity in an open-market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that it is ready to take further steps to obtain the daily interest rates on interbank loans with their basic interest rate.
The interest rate differential from day to day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has staggered to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer’s financial crisis, the amounts put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalty fees which banks had refrained from making use of them.
According to some rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound exchange rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, at more favourable interest rates and with more secure discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS's proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill for purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text drawn up in the framework of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the PS National Committee, of which 50% were for the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIPP fleet, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which resulted in some violent exchanges of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's TV contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of the finances that had been examined by the Assemble last week.
A new festival will be born
As a result of numerous rumours about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no longer and no less, served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones told of C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most renowned producers.
In 1989 he took the lead at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been involved in the production of the license concessions and the organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he's ever been to, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn are working side by side to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We held negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in political debate about the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Unfortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents revived the 2005 Lollapalooza Festival in the Grand Park Chicago, after being part of the Festival's World Music Festival in 2002, together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events were able to achieve $9.8 million and $11.8 million respectively in gross tax revenues in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours takes place more on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, in order to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban one in the American way."
Vineland is about half way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but confirms "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", corresponding to the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal, if no less than the Terminator is opposed.
These lock attempts are among the delegated tasks.
A political "heikle's mandate" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Gouvernator?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If they find that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, they will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are thought to be the best," he says.
The run at the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the main priority at the moment is the introduction of the cinema.
Hunting for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festival on the west coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30. Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec has also presented four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Is the stock market facing a year-end rally? Disappointment among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks to the end of the year, investors are already getting their hands on the upcoming final year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot produce reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December on the stock market usually goes hand in hand with a positive market trend
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics.
Although other experts did not approve such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants. These invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of secure equity funds, which are heavily affected by the upward trend in earnings.
As a result, in the opinion of these experts, the stock market will tend to have a rather lateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the U.S. notes, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increase in the price of crude oil and the risk of the rise in the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, assures the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its highest mark on 8 November of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional pension fund grant made each year around this time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that things could develop differently this year, especially as a result of the final year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and thus directly after the day of the bridge to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, the price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inverses, the previous market situation assessments are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, the extent of which is dependent on the impact of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
The analysts agree on the choice of values to push Ibex towards new peaks.
Solana of Intermoney claims that this year are the great values on the line.
Among the value winners would be the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile Federico Olucha assures Bank Inverses that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually takes place, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS was on a pick-up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, according to the expert.
With regard to increased consumption behaviour during the Christmas day, the market situation will be determined in the last half of the year by periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are represented only in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December only showed falling price trends in two cases.
At the end of 2003, when the technology bubble burst, the stock market led to its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real year-end rally.
This year, when Ibex 35 gained 28.17 percentage points, December saw a price increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth year in a row (the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and can also show a final year rally will be shown.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Mondays to Fridays 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the strongest regions of Spain.
For the institute that operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a big milestone.
But also for the other Spanish institutes, since Popular as the first banking group dares to extend the opening hours of its branches weekdays to 20.30h and to assume on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in its branches, has not yet taken a final decision.
The current negotiations between the Bank and the trade unions seem to be aimed at reaching an agreement in which 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for this on a weekday afternoon, although not for the customer.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening times, will depend on the experience of Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention of popular with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches that, due to their location, can capture the customership of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but modified opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of the branches already located in business zones and at the same time adapt them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of the opening hours is associated with a new spatial design of the branches, which is characterized by a more modern, colourful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require major investments, but included increased staff recruitment, since a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
Branches, even equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried out his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently leads approximately 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, explains Rivero.
They have provisionally agreed to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private radio station Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this phrase, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The station he led had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that is exactly what was hurt to me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they did not fall too deeply.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now reaches EUR 4.488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main proportion of capital (52%), and Vocento only participating with 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1,52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, with a market value of 2.193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communication companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, Prisa (editor of the Cinco Días magazine) to 2.518.53 million and Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, according to Vasile.
The question of the extent to which we can actually act in terms of stock exchange technology, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level is, of course, still not clear.
One week ago, Telecinco announced its plan to increase its advertising revenue to the first television station this year with more than 1000 million gross profits. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project were to be implemented, the transmitter would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine market months (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco's improved stock market performance is the high payout ratio that the company could have had up to the present date.In 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría had a 100% dividend distribution.
Vasile, however, assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as parent company, even though it is too early for official announcement.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares to the official compromise, even if we have always stated much more so far.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share value we have already increased by buying 33% of the end-mol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently showing certain trends in losses.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the expected rate of increase, which will decrease from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 Options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (shopping) has a more favourable position than Antena 3 because of the multiple incentives and the prosperous market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends reducing expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary drafting which today concluded its meeting with the Senate resolution on the supplementary/amendative proposals for the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of enabling both regulations to enter into force by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congressmen and Senate delegates, who had pursued the objective in their negotiations and votes, to establish the best possible rules that would guarantee investor security and regulate individual entrepreneurial activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market.
In addition to modernising financial markets, MIFID, which redefines the Securities Services Regulations, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the Spanish Securities Commission's supervisory claim (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the different supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows for the provision of financial advice to specialised companies as well as to natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the consultancy companies which join the investment and intermediary companies of securities.
It also expands the number of financial transaction execution systems, adding to the regulated circulation markets the multilateral securities trading systems and the internationalization of trading orders, which would ultimately compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment firms to publicise the focus of their corporate profile, the confrontation and the ways in which risks are dealt with on the market and to register all the projects carried out in order to facilitate their control task for CNMV.
The Congress's Economic Commission provided for further changes afterwards, whereby the decision that the securities-backed bonds must now be regarded as complex financial resources for the investor due to their high risk level has been confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal restriction of the working areas of qualified economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation restricting the working areas reserved for economists was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on a foreign account, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for customer acquisition at the same time several investment companies.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare location and quality with US products by providing data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared prematurely by applying the same procedure as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that does not exist at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the indicator, which had been established prematurely, should serve only as a benchmark and should therefore not be in line with the final result announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain relatively high
According to the Deputy Head of Government and Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase of the VPI in November was a temporary development; at the same time, the VPI assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless , Solbes in the halls of the Congress building noted that , although the current number is not good , the difference in inflation between Spain and the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years .
In addition, he explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such an increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, announced by the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenue of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock's assets have fallen by more than half, after the Bank had asked the British Bank for emergency credit in mid-September of last year's crisis, and now only GBP 12,000 million (EUR 16,800 million).
At that time, the bank's assets amounted to a record GBP 25,000 million, a sum that has fallen significantly within two and a half months due to the customer's loss of confidence, and even despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money is safe, will continue to decline until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would continue the group under the Virgin Money brand name after the acquisition, will have to invest about a quarter of the British banks' income, which will be composed of the assets for the next three years, to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds needed to reach their target of 30 billion pounds.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, who is well-known for his striking advertising campaigns in the UK, plans to have 50,000 million pounds (equivalent to about 70 million euros) spent each year in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are still involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for suspected participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) in Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
Last May, José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at that time a chairman of the Totana Municipal Council, and could, after information from the radio station Cadena SER, be the original leader of the plot.
The officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular , and therefore privileged MP Juan Morales, was arrested for leaving his client's residence on the basis of important burdensome documents related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on the alleged order payments Morales to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of a city-building contract, in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
At present, eight people are in custody.
Bono agrees to accept PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, in the event of a victory in the Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will list the PSOE candidates in the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory of the Socialists, take over the office of President of Congress.
José Blanco, the organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero was held today at the party's headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the forthcoming elections, the politician from Mancha would appear to be candidates for the party as president of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of Congress, who announced last November 15 that he would no longer take up the next general elections, end his career in public policy, and instead pursue his career in the university field of climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had continually urged him to return to politics.
He also pointed out that, as with the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to prevent the citizens who would take over the position of President of the Congress in the event of a election victory, and called it an act of transparency .
If he is actually to take over the office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not insult or scream, so as to make it appear more and more like to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time one gets the impression that the only place in Madrid where one cannot talk calmly and quietly is the Congress; so the President of the Government was interrupted up to 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, he praised the current President, Manuel Martín, and his good work and indicated that he did not want to give the impression that he had already taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would call it arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is critical of both the skeptics of climate change and those who put the emphasis on social and political debate in this regard, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal brings it to the fore in a lack of explanation as to the action or non-action of its government, which has made it crucial for Spain to be at the forefront of the countries that have least met the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the responsible for non-fulfilment of the requirements to which sectors this is due, and why did not his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, stop this development.
In addition, it is now forced to present to Spanish citizens the measures it intends to take against climate change without any rescheduling.
Which companies will be affected, which will change the behaviour of citizens, which individual and collective austerity measures will have to be implemented and which economic consequences will result from this.
More precisely, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and will be no such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and paying.
The measures that can be used against climate change are unpopular.
They are cost-effective, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE appeared so dangerously strategic that Zapatero was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its contracts with the planet, the politicians who are otherwise suitable for election campaigns must neither speak nor accuse, nor demand, but instead follow the demanding edition, decorate the meetings and inspire others with its gentleness and goodness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not differ from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not indicate that the bicycle will in future become the only means of transport or we can only refresh ourselves with one compartment.
The mayor and the chief of police of Totana due to a supposed involvement in urban corruption.
Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana belonging to Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel contractor were also arrested because of the alleged suspicion of urban violations, it was today called by investigative circles.
The city council was arrested at its residence, from where it was brought to the municipal office and in whose premises it is located until the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the local construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to the fact that, in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, the last Monday had already seen the conversion of more than 2 million hectares of unrecognised building ground for urban projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which was supposed to be built on the plot of 4000 dwellings after illegal commissions had been received by the local administration during the last legislative period.
In addition, two more persons were not arrested directly, but were subjected to an investigation initiated and conducted by the First Court of Totonas.
The first six arrested have been brought before the judge today.
According to the investigation circles, the former mayor of Totana and the currently independent PP member Juan Morales are also investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his present girlfriend, residing in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose companies are acting as subgroup of Nuaria and are supposed to have received the lubrication money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban offences, under the supervision of the Central Unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out 11 more searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry breeding industry, who is supposed to have acted as a middleman.
Nuaria was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which was to be rebuilt. The aim was to implement a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group comprises other companies such as Autesa and Inneruar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the field of direct marketing and Preconiza, specialising in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the expression book of the month and instead try to invent a price name of other names with corresponding skills.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to submit your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is also at the head of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; by chance, on that day, the issue of which contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the subject philosophy has become a topic of public debate after the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murder is an abiturant who quoted in his news the works Platon and Nietzsches.
Pekka Elo, Chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, asked the teachers in an interview of the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat to take a more critical position on Plato and suggested to remove Plato's teaching from the sub-plans for philosophy in secondary schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a breach of law that would be subject to six months' imprisonment.
But if you take out a music business below a value of 400 euros again, this is only considered a simple infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is committed as a criminal offence, yet the penalty is lower than for a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you cut a car and return it forty hours later, then the penalty is still lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to take part in a fight than in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebel conflict involves a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a withdrawal of liberty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 Criminal Code).
E. Under Article 184(2) of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at the workplace is considered to be less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorization by the authors has not taken place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film materials to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague should have the right, then someone has screwed up his demands very nicely.

My home doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when others get more from it.
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of colleagues.
The study was prepared with the help of a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the last edition of the Science journal.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn Brain Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was strongest when the participant gave the correct answers and his partner failed.
The researchers could see that brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were correct and therefore also the same; but when one of them received the doubles, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Balkan Attorney
Carla del Ponte has been incessantly following the criminals of the Balkan Wars for eight years. Her office is located in the Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Its mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and a laughing eye, as the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - which killed eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - namely ex-general Ratko Mladic and former Serbian-Bosian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on the loose.
Her names are on the list of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a presentation for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet started in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, follows the Swiss state attorney from Belgrade to New York in her plan to track the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
The car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost, the height of which depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of the creation of the driving licence, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear about what we are dealing with here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement shall be established in writing by means of an insurance contract which establishes that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to submit the corresponding amount of the claim in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance, which consists of several factors, including age, gender, time of issue of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contribution payments are also made in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women must pay less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since, according to the statement of statistical values and therefore also to the conviction of enterprises, they tend to be less likely to be accidents than single persons.
The benefits attributed to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When drawing up the premium, insurance must take into account a whole range of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
At this point, we are now listing the most important points to consider when selecting insurance in order to be able to make a price-oriented choice as well as a performance.
Under 25-year-olds face numerous obstacles when choosing low-cost insurance, such as low driving practice and a young driver's license.
Even if it is best for an ideal insurance cover to complete a comprehensive insurance, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a full-time self-employed insurance company, so that the services of a full-time insurance company are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay part of the amount incurred as a result of the damage.
The amount will be determined before the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher than the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative to First Europe, an intermediary for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance, which assures the customer against external damage to the accident, but not against the damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; your credit will increase by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit rating is a reduction in the basic tariff of the insurance company concerned.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in the rates mentioned.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on the society and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most useful to decide on full insurance with self- participation.
In general, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish leader of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been expressed.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not own children to take out a comprehensive insurance policy; of course, only if he allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
On the part of the insurers, couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and their contribution payments are therefore low.
In this case, the best option would be a self-employed comprehensive insurance (for an amount of EUR 300). In case of a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which will only be used for the third year of the vehicle.
They are generally more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to make a higher contribution payment, says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is proposed to take out a full-time self-employed insurance (for an amount of EUR 150), or an extended insurance, which only uses a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be borne in mind that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damage, but also because it has high costs, which require that a thorough selection is made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan for the eighth finale
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point that they are missing in San Siro next Tuesday to reach their respective goals before the end of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while the latter decides on their participation in the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow needed another one with nine points to make sure that FC Shahtar did not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to take part in the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the 13th semifinals for entry to the final, which will take place on the 16th.
This group will be concluded before all others and the undecision at the Meazza Stadium in Guiseppe to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win, because the Italians will not speculate at home, the Celtic Glasgow knows that in the event of a win, they would have a better starting position in the eighth final.
Gordon Strachan’s team could even have a defeat to qualify for a flop at the FC Shahtar. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points of equality the Ukrainians were allowed to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win at the second game (2-0).
Therefore, the Milaners will try to beat the Scots up the evening. Again, they hope to reach the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after they were defeated in exactly the same round in the previous season by a goal of Kaka in the playtime (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the game.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for Rossoneri's victory, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the eighth final and its UEFA membership depend on its victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could take third place by winning and thus playing with UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls in Vancouver, Canada, saw 20,000 spectators kick off their first tour after the band's dissolution in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver Stadium that the atmosphere in the reunited band is excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the sold out stadium, where a video of the band's history, which had provided Furore with at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, and which appears under the label of EMI in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on the stage that the husband of Posh Spice , the English footballer David Beckham, had previously donated to them.
The athlete was among the crowds in the audience who made the GM Palace glow, although Victoria's wife's nerves had banned it from him in the previous days.
While preparing for the Show, Victoria Beckham said that the British star didn't get our wardrobe on the other side of the road for the first time, and that's why I'm already very excited about what he's gonna do with the show.
Sporty Spice , whose departure from the group in 1998 due to differences of opinion two years later brought about the dissolution of the group, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought, why not, so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed himself on the separation of the band she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also announced that the disputes were eliminated and that by now everyone is very happy again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in a special aircraft of the Vancouver Virgin Airlines, according to a report from the CTV television station.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received by an army of baby girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and December 7th).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New concerns about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian exports of natural gas to the European Union (EU) is led by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit charges from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced supplies to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is taking place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more, as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in conversations," said Anatoli Kinakh, Ukraine's Minister of Economic Affairs of the Reuters News Agency.
"The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges [to Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, which led to a dramatic rise in prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the largest gas deposits in the world, but much of this remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must check foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve controls of the criminal records of workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish public health service had no precise idea of the number of its foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly on a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller investigated personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area countries as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a field car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission at Old Bailey in October and was charged with the alleged bombing in the UK.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out pre-employment checks to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The Chief Auditor's report now states, along with other recommendations, that the Executive Board should use guidelines on how to extract criminal records to help employers in controls in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these checks in some staff documents, these were not routinely carried out."
Black said that Scottish health authorities would follow their pre-employment investigation directives to a great extent, but added: "Our report identifies areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment investigations of potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that the NHS Scotland's current pre-employment tests work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the board of directors had problems identifying those employees who were on leave for an indefinite period of time.
The investigation further found that established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely respected.
These include passports, work permits, and qualifications checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its pre-employment policies and guidelines for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Surgeon said, "It was a matter of concern to me to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on pre-employment controls would reflect the publication of all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is scheduled next month.
Joy Division Dominates Film Award Awards

Nevertheless, he has presented two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, who has previously been best known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, as the best director and the best director's debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer received the award for the best documentary film.
The prize for the best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenbergs in London playing Thriller Eastern Promise.
Ray Winston, who stands in the reputation of playing hard guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming Indiana Jones' continuation of The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skoll.
Winston said he was proud to receive the prize named in honour of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 militants because of their belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as on spiritual and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells planned to smuggle rockets.
Sympathizers of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion into Iraq.
A cell of eight militias, led by a foreign citizen, planned a attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a fast intervention force of 35,000 men to protect plants after a failed Al-Quida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, with reference to a ministerial declaration, says that 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated into the country.
He reports that the militias planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the detainees were responsible for killing clergy and security forces.
The government has warned more to stop Saudis who seek Iraq to join Al-Qaida militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the Hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda Milizen regards many clergymen in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda leader born in Saudi Arabia, to aim for the pro-Western Saudi government - have apart from foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector installations.
"This was a great effort by the security forces over the last... five months," one speaker from the Ministry of the Interior told the public television.
The arrests also involved a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims, which are branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested, 32 people were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could show a view of the future of the Earth
Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a orbit show that the planet is even more like an averse twin of Earth than was previously conscious.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor of the Earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but the Venus of the Sun is slightly closer.
Billions of years ago, scientists believe that Venus has had conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even have been habitable today.
But because of the most unbroken carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotation speed, Venus began a completely different development course.
Today the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which examined the plants for one year, provide a debilitating insight into how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data enable us to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Populated Uranium" seized by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
One police officer said that three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
All left open
My Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate finally agreed for the presidency to hold a debate on YouTube, video-recording and submitting questions in the normal voters to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28th, were as ridiculous as the Snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican Party that breaks into the elections next year.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers who supported the debate selected the YouTube clips to be shown to the upcoming candidates.
However, during the first half hour of the debate, the longest one devoted to a single topic, immigration was at the centre of the debate.
The topic is one of the most important topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed tips of approval when the candidates were talking strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who moved forward in the key surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation that he was addicted to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former Governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two were particularly fiercely opposed to the question whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegal would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Less important candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to pick up on this topic.
None of the two men have any serious chances of nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have cut the immigration stakes earlier and harder than others.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: sharper borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This theme, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One questioner asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another question asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now facing all expectations in the first place in a recent Iowa survey thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When he was urged whether Jesus would support them, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's ascent in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donation successes and his whirlwinds in the debate of Wednesday.
These two have been raised out of nowhere, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinkling to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall into; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not very clever.
No noble titles seem to have been sold, no political Parisian hotel bills paid, no extramarital toes were sucked.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has been hiding donations for the British ruling Labour Party for more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) for four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something that the contested Gordon Brown would have done well without.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister had withdrawn the call for elections, in a stupid way insulting the British intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, who was increasingly emphatically representing the Liberal Democrats, it has developed from Stalin to Mr. Bean, once feared Brown.
The unsatisfied rescue of Northern Rock, a hit bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thoughtful proposals to amend tax laws have been made by business associations against the government.
The tax authorities lost personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative looting.
A trio of retired generals started a rebellion in the upper house protesting against cuts in military spending: to be Minister of the Armed Forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and her former Head of Fulfilment) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown will irrevocably break the direction of resignation.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point where they feel it is impossible to govern.
Neither people like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be there for a long time, this delay is over: the public service is starting to fail; the Cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and purposeless.
In one way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
If he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax documents, for example, are linked to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blair's misdeeds - as with the long "money for nobles" investigation of political party financing - the voters may assume it was.
Even so, Brown's situation is not as bad as it looks.
The sins are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely dissipated.
And the opposite, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new act of political donation is a good example.
The garboeske Abrahams, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he wishes no public recognition for his benevolence.
That may be the case, but he was not allowed to decide.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial entrepreneur, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But until now Brown has not been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after taking office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grasping it according to a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - in order to take the measure of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, "the lessons to be drawn" are not very complicated.
If the law's broken, it's one thing for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent committee on standards in public life, which has been unsettled for six months, and moving forward with a thorough reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party partner like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through unquestionable fairness and solid competence.

Does the credit crisis affect the credit card market in America?
If blood is in the water, it's only natural that back fins are excited around.
Now that America's real estate market is in violation, the predators have the country's credit card market in the visor.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of infection of underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both book-out rates and in pension rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are either non-deductible or more than 30 days late.
Last month, HSBC announced that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from US consumer finance, partly due to the weakness of credit card recipients.
It is still too early to panic.
Losses and pumices are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third quarter rate of GDP of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy claims, which in turn represent a large part of the loss of chain cards; the number of claims (and thus of pension fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports on sound payment rates that show how much of its debt consumers pay off every month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the final output for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
There are no doubt direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will accept credit card debts, now that home loans are drying up.
However, the card issuers look at the cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
You can even be of benefit to the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates are reduced if real estate is less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexible than creditors to the stormier conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of the assets.
"We won't wake up one day and reassess the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer.
Even if a sudden cover-up crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a reduction in credit in America push into recession, the industry will undoubtedly be facing a bigger future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British banks confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers, who were supposed to be brought to trial for their role in the fraudulent system with the former Chief Financial Officer of Enron, Andrew Fastow, were guilty on Wednesday of changing their requests.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000, to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated on January.
But during a hearing in court before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to fraud using telecommunications.
The three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, its case is a loose end to an investigation started after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 drew Fastow's attention to the fact that he was the target of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Drei" - claims that they had come to Houston in 2000 to find a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron assets that contributed to tearing the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it was in fact of significant value.
A company under the control of Copper acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid copper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually, the $20 million went to British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others sank about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed in two charges of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year prison sentence in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is sentenced to three years and one month in a Texarkana facility.
Each of the three men was free on the basis of a $1 million deposit that required them to live in the United States in anticipation of trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, collapsed in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions of debt or make weakening businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion in market value and more than two billion dollars in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in connection with the Enron merger.
Skilling is punishable by a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges became void after he died last year because of heart disease.
Not all down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least 54 million dollars.
But this is small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it is for a private family or a president of the company."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day Orgy from the consumption shown in a nestled exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital city.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly-earned Russians in everything, from Mahagoni-tabled yachts to diamond-covered car grinds, which would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a shiny orange Porsche at the next stand.
"This is a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"According to the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems so flooded with money like Dallas at its glorious times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the world's most generous financial publishers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
In Moscow, elsewhere, this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, has attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, with a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the minimum level of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-kept and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they go through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, identify themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked for the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothing she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to aim primarily at the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in the stall for several hours to visit a nearby warehouse that modestly placed Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knife, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made Billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotically sitting at a booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper climbers."
In fact, the merchants here say that the Russians have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities of money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people pushed through the halls every day, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millions, or simply tourists.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company that high-end cars with high-end alarm systems equipped with high-end alarms had sold the big orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, said that a company that adapts luxury cars to customer demands, had sold three car coolers for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are the same chain bracelets, for 55,000 dollars each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulettead.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-replace.
"The Russian millionaire, the steel leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face from cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep it in his 30 or 40-wheel garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian Millionaires" would not currently express much exclusivity, given the rise in property prices there.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaire, at least on paper, if not already in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least act as if they were rich at a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to British model, which were clogged with mountains of fake million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees would have printed out 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaire trade fair.
Passersby stopped to throw around the piles of money, mobile phone photos while leaning back in the middle of the substitute wealth, being cut by friends, or simply plugging in a few million.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Conjected operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest celebration when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance on the white Cape Cod stopped two doors further down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, a police car was there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the box car of the medical body looker arrive," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The audience learned that the dead Ms. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to find out if she died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who was not identified by the police and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that sent a grief through the leadership of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006 and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and stubborn," Mr. McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized, surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," Ms. Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Mrs. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a thorny rose shrub stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel marked with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that'," he said.
"She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will reduce interest rates will lead to an increase in global equity markets
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further lowering interest rates, strengthened by troubling comments from the Vice President of the US Central Bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, President of the Central Bank, said that policy had to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down devastating markets, in the face of signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulences would have "partly some of the improvements in the market functions of the late September and October vice versa".
If the increased turbulence persisted, it would increase the possibility of further tightening up the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to enter and with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate reductions to stabilise credit conditions.
The presentations also helped calm Wall Street, in the face of other bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US real estate reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4% of its global employees, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for heavy losses from their lost investments in the US mortgage credit sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the Bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55%, to close at 13,289.40, while the wider S&P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's index Dax rose by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 grew by 2.3 percent.
In the past, the resurgence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined, following a substantial 4.7% increase in demand for an auction of three-month guarantees by the European Central Bank granted to the European commercial banks, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to invest further capital in the money markets in London increased when the three-month Libor Councils to borrow between UK banks increased by 6.59 percent to their maximum since late September, after a continuous increase since November 21st.
England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who is to beat number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, is here at least under this special title to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, is gradually filling up with applications for national voters, if not even for those in part-time.
Whoever does not get the sixth bat position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is without doubt.
It is never easy to nail exactly what enables a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets out of the lowest rank, sometimes due to lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket, where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah when he does?
The same can perhaps also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good qualifications, should be promoted to the business.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a whip and a bat must get regular chances if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the pickers is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who was apparently going to play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and how the wind is bowling into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets each with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at the Asgiriya Stadium can only be a point of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and was successful in the first, with five whips and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still struggling to solidify himself, which made the breakthrough into a major test cricket player and which, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and abdominal feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after further discussion at the Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, speaks, and an excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection from the voters as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his beating that was still obvious in Bombay.
On the contrary, the all-rounder from Essex has boldly enjoyed his life.
He is impressed by nothing on a cricket pitch and his attitude apart from it was brought to the point when he had recently crossed over a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from a distance, and to say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he bowls his mid-tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Selecting the right man is one thing to choose the right time.
Maybe that's the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah might not be well standing there when, as the Ceylon tea set suggests, he's the one who's going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, regarding the Shiite militias of militant clergyman Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the vast Sunni section of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he was unable to renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime did not allow them to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia, supported by the United States, has helped to expel Al-Qaida from its bastion in the western part of the capital, and forced him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his house in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by hand grenade attack after asking his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaida militias in Sleikh and that they need my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the US troops increased and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens" who armed and, in cooperation with the American military, defend their neighbourhoods.
But more talked of being forced home by visa problems and sluggish money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exilers that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced no more visas to the Iraqis to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunni were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have left behind.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will resurrect sectarian tensions and conflict will arise.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is the leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in a field of education does the Saar countries express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
" yesterday, for the 50th time in a non-Saarland, I explained that we are not French" - this slogan self-righteously signs the smallest federal state for its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is in fifth place in the educational monitor of the Institute of German Economy Cologne (IW).
For example, universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
However, the state children also bring Saarland above average to the universities - many of them without a degree at the gymnasium.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their study qualification at a vocational school, which means that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is also relatively well developed.
According to the population, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"We started a number of reforms at general education schools after the first Pisa study," says a spokesman from the Ministry of Education.
For example, the government introduced country-wide comparative tests.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last year of Kita is free of charge - a model that in the meantime also copy other federal states.
If the performance of the pupils improves sustainably, future comparative studies will only be shown.
At Pisa 2003, the share of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
However, the Saarland did not grow as strongly as other federal states.
The Bavarias expect better.
And to the waste of the Saarlands foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area you could otherwise score.
For the language of the neighbours is compulsory in high school - even if the Saarlands are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks around
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will be turning back the timepieces in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joker.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela reported, according to a new law, the clocks are switched to world time less than four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez explained his decision, among other things, that the United States would have imposed the division into time zones for full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced the interruption of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia due to a hostage shop on Wednesday (local time).
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe president of Colombia remained, he would not maintain relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is advancing a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country must vote on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The result of the dispute was the decision by Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages.
Uribe had spitted Venezuela with his decision "in the face", Chávez had criticized Sunday.
In Spain too, Chávez is in all its mouths.
A new cell phone ringtone in the country ensures Furore: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was told by Spanish king Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-American summit had been embarrassed by the constant calls of the left-wing populist and who had driven him over his mouth.
Germans threaten 2007 Payminus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are expected to lose real wages this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could actually expect less in 2007 on the salary account than in the previous year.
"This is done by the modest wage developments, the increase in VAT and the price increases for food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Image" newspaper.
New burdens could also be imposed on employees in the case of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (New Osnabrücker Zeitung) that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the end of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not again be embarrassed to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the food and mineral oil price explosion has driven inflation to the highest level for 13 years.
Prices rose by 3.0 per cent year on year.
Venus is the holy twin of the earth
Despite its anti-life atmosphere, Venus is thought to be more similar than before: The European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and whirlwinds in the Poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades scientists have suspected that it is blinding on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has proven - it detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightnings on Venus shoot at a height of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud," says Christopher Russel of the University of California in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory", lightning has created life on earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean leading to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly any living thing on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on earth, sometimes having temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the devil's twin of the earth, but it is a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has made such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the beginning of the nineties no probe was specifically on the way to exploring this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with Earth are greater than initially assumed," the Esa says.
In addition to the already known whirlwind on the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud structure on the South Pole, which turns much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of airflows on the Earth's winter hemisphere, a team of researchers working with Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmoca.
The secondmost planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening stars, circles around the sun in almost 225 days.
But it turns around itself much slower: a Venustag lasts 243 days on earth.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly reminds of the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have developed under very similar conditions.
Water was collected on both, which remained on the earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbonate rocks, on Venus it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Kohler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has asked the large coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a split nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled his understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"For me, human rights have universal validity, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knew that Germany had to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took protection from the accusation that she was pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional one-China policy.
That also knows China," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly revealed discomfort over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked by rows of the Union.
Steinmeier had complained about the Union's "framework policy" in foreign policy, among other things.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership has not only invited the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but, according to information from the SPIEGEL, has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of both countries.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China refuses when European politicians officially receive the Tibetan religious leader, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns against crabs like in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against Krawallen as in France.
Everything had to be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany did not escape into violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, Randalierers shot at the police with shotguns: After the severe youth riots in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We need to make sure that we do not build up in our social explosives and elevate into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" which was published in Hanover.
Not every young person is able to cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Bund, countries and municipalities have already worked hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Islamic Conference, this already shows the first successes."
However, it is too early to warn.
Schäuble also pointed out that there were no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had been carrying out heavy street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings also burned.
However, greater integration efforts of the Federal Government demanded the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the face of the crash in France, colat warned of "implementation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as bright as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background was "over average" under 25 years of age.
More training places had to be provided in particular.
Kolat stressed: "We need to give young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community, however, added that in Germany more than in France "a social control takes place in the families".
In addition, many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents have built up here.
Kolat warned, "But we still have to watch out."
Young people had to be given "a quick opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter was flying over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as a couple of burning dumpsters and cars.
Since the day before, a supply of around 1000 security forces has provided peace and quiet.
The police will go through as long as necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburbs.
During the night on Tuesday, around 80 police officers had been injured at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night, the unrest took over Toulouse.
The Crawalls were triggered by a traffic accident in which two young people had died on Sunday.
According to the initial findings of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young people.
In the Empire of Angela Cloud
The chancellor's far-fetched appearance documents that the coalition is in the end - and that nothing can be expected of her own.
Which country does this Chancellor live in?
After her unsatisfied appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was gruesome and poor in contention, one must say: not here - not in the country that should finally be ruled by her.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is too focused on foreign policy with a very overwhelming sentence.
That was provincial, she said and showed that she did not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, it has documented for everyone clearly how much their accusations are about.
There was neither a concrete interest nor a feeling of feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Cloude presented herself: a withdrawn politician who flees to foreign policy and even remains in danger there.
For example, climate protection: since it continuously praises the decisions of Heiligendamm, it does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
At all, the self-loathing - so much modesty the CDU-Chefin would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the raft that the upswing is coming to the people.
She thus damaged her image as a pragmatist, which solves problems instead of beautiful talking the world.
But in Angela Cloude's realm domestic problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low earners?
A couple of side sentences left her for that.
It is significant how often she promises to be when it comes to the child's allowance.
There are three approaches that Merkel needs to get out a pretty straight sentence.
It stumbles like on a foreign land when it becomes concrete.
Attack Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney provide themselves with a hard stroke - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This, on its part, counters with heavy accusations: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegals," said Giuliani and accused the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favourites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The self-played 30-second videos that Internet users have sent via YouTube are hardly any more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain accuses his counterpart Ron Paul, who is the only one who calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq in the round.
Romney, too, is strongly read by the Vietnamese veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called waterboarding, a method of interrogation that simulates drowning as torture.
However, the fact that the major topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates shows the reactions of the public in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, there is applause in the Auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney and asked the bassist and television audience to say that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into the loop when, in his opinion, he is asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rule for the first time in civil society
One day after his resignation as Head of Army, the Pakistani leader Musharraf has been sworn as President.
This brings the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn for another five-year term of office on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony in the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad live.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his post as Chief of Army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure especially from the USA.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unblooded military coup, the former General is now ruling for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency that Musharraf imposed on 3 November.
Soon after his oath, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency and thus fulfil a further demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him after the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, had rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in a attack on a military convoy in the northern region of North Waziristan and four more were injured.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghanistan border.
The Fathers of the Krautrock return
Germany's Supergroup of the Seventies is playing again: Harmonia's three band members took on their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
The Revival is a recording of her great time "Live 1974".
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The enraged sensation then takes place in the form of three set gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of them, his cables and especially his buttons.
Dieter Moebius comes in a flower white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the Auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, clings to the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
And sometimes it happens to add to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
That the band is playing Harmonia again has provided some excitement under herb rock lovers.
Here one may reveal: Targeted requests revealed that although the name was shaken by collective pop memory, it was by no means so sustainable that this band had been painfully missing for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German also be allowed to celebrate its living legends from the 1970s?
Especially in England and America, what is called misleading cream rock has always been more than in one's own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life's Work to the survivors of the Cologne Group Can 2003 they were seen in the hall in asking German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the surprise did not have any limits.
Later, at concerts, Michael Rother played the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the x-ray in the stranger is one.
The memory has already been overtaken by harmony, because the trio existed for only two years and at that time also developed a much lower power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played under the promising name Cluster with the artist Conrad Schnitzler.
First they played in the cellar under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and subsequently played a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the then perhaps most radical German group.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musician into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruins, they lived as city refugees.
Less ideological than in the municipality of I, where Roedelius was still allowed to be plagued as a baby girl.
It's more like being an artist.
According to the report, the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art were also used in the pulping.
Some kept Harmonia from it.
The first album was "Music of Harmonia" and the next one was "De Luxe".
For so leftn and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The collection of rice was not the sole function of self-determination.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record setting of almost 50 people, as someone believes to be insinuating.
From Rother came the desire to force and practice harmony at times.
For Roedelius and Moebius an undue demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric-Spherical and secured his existence with albums such as "flamming hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful since it was ever Harmonia.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
The goal of Greenland's record company is to maintain the Krautrock as its own German contribution to live music.
New! was already excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical revival of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidised, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Old Punk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
The whole range of influences of the herb rock on the following pop music would have been outlined.
Harmonia fills the space of the supergroup.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most distinctive sounds in the hall: "The only true music you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producer with harmony in the farmhouse.
The legends serve as projections of other black and white photographs of our wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again concerned with improvisation.
No longer by attaching microphones to the organ and to the drums in order to extract unheard of tones from the instruments via self-contained effects instruments.
Today the electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three technically-deep tüftlers.
There is no change in the choir of the house.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, sound clouds are heated and covered and sung in a beautiful place with emphase "Aaaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (Can), technologies (forcework) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Who calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia can not get away with it now.
The most obvious is completely covered on the stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of your nerves or give you great happiness for fleeting moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Mordernische Frieden" two more films deal with the Balkans war.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and blowers or they are too touching.
Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, except for there, in the dark background of the Bosnia-Herzegovina, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because too many nice and unimportant roles in women's wellbeing films and too many press conferences on Buddhism excite one's desire for attention.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - When the hunter is hunted" (Why do movie titles always have to be as long and angry as locomotive leader tarif contracts today?)
He provides a wonderfully eye-catching representation: In essence, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been said if the fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has long been behind his very best times, but who himself has preserved considerable remains of the former charm as a ruinous monument to his decline.
But despite this trumpet, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Mordernischer Frieden", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar hedgeguards, on which one quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that once the Serbs are not represented as the sole root of all evils, the TV movie loses itself too quickly in bangers and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but for it with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be researched in a very exemplary way, why there has never actually been a really good Balkan war movie.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to track the Serbian war criminal "the fox" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another screenwriter (both in Human Resources Union Richard Shepard).
For the stories are very similar: both times small teams go into the forest to do something the military can't do and both times it's going to be a trip into the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt isn't just letting the late cynics be hearty when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script still has to close a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
In the end, "The Hunting Party" will go down the stream if the reporters succeed within the last five minutes in the time-lapse process what NATO, the CIA and all the world's money hunters have done in five years: catch the war criminals and give the Muslim Bosnians a just revenge.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema logic.
The film has a deep human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (unfortunately they should agree) not to carry out the persecution due to secret political agreements too intensely.
But the good meant and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes into mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "I feel the swollen foreheads, suggesting: how hard it is to be evil".
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly the same threshold heads, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan War Film.
Recently in this newspaper it has been reported that all Iraq movies were Hollywood's great flops.
One can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always, if a star drives around the world's crisis herds or minefields, something like "Rangoon" comes out with Patricia Arquette, "Besides all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood could shoot a good movie about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" and "Full Metal Jacket" now apply as classics have by no means been celebrated as masterpieces.
But perhaps today we know where every mass murder comes into real-time on two screens at home, even just too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the screenwriters of the unconcernedness it needs to tell good stories.
"Being or not" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps one must have the sarcastically distanced artist's view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Big cities will always be awfully dangerous, people will always be murdered in an awful way and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Beust harvests criticism for Olympia Absage
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games has been severely criticised by politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the games at the water.
But from Beust, realism encourages the assessment of opportunities.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called a waiver on Wednesday "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as much motivational powers in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, the momentum of sport policy could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "based on a modified timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with previous statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic by at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation to apply for the 2018 Winter Games in Munich, which is expected to take place at the beginning of December.
"This preference means that we will not have any realistic opportunities in the period until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamy for all time, said Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build up an opportunity by burying the plans already at this time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
In addition, a waiver of the application is in opposition to the Senate Chief of Staff's statement on the occasion of a reception at the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
There, Beust described Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD-Citizenship faction accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the Olympia map and excluded housing," said the SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Small Grassbrook had always demanded integrated planning for Olympia and later residential use, the CDU had set the "Event Factor" one-sidedly.
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had triggered a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at that time.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Who connects the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Right?
Currently, wooden boxes in Sweden are throwing dark shadows at Warhol's work directory.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there from the "Type Stockholm" are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" had doubted the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes of 1968 several months ago, internal research at Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to a debilitating conclusion: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has donated to Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably also the majority of the approximately 100 more Brillo-Boxes of the "type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The pre-history is intertwined, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol's consent, produced hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard: these were (for reasons of cost) not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo Cardonagen factory.
They were not works of art, but their role models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auction as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name "Typ Stockholm" rightly.
Some of them have scored more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 around one hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol was dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator at Moderna Museet, studied three Swedish private property in addition to the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press plates were first founded and glazed, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of the copies from 1990 reveals that the colour was applied directly to the press panel with a paint roll without foundation - it is also not an oil but an acrylic color.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo Box," says Lars Nittve, Director of Moderna Museet: "If the "Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board" in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibitions."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would follow up on the "serious accusations" raised in the soap powder boxes.
But since then they have been covered in inexorable silence.
Insurgent soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers abandoned, who were hiding in a hotel in Manila and had demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be held responsible for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters at the hotel.
The hotel had previously been used by government soldiers with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been hiding in the building for hours.
Around half of them were in court on Thursday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them trillanes.

They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyale government forces blocked the district around the noble hotel.
The President called an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the Scout Ranger elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for great demonstrations against the President on Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
Manila's financial district was already 2003 the main venue of the attempted mutiny of about 200 military members against Arroyo.
The rebellion failed after almost 24 hours of the army refusal to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
