Members of the National Assembly of Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have expressed their regret at the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is the plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the "Welsh Parliament".
National Assembly members of all political directions fear becoming the target of the joke.
One member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because the name “trims with “Twp” and “Pwp”.
For non-Wasian readers: In Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" stands for "aa".
A member of the National Assembly of the Plaid Cymru Party stated that the entire group was "unhappy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the change of name, but pointed out the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: 'The final decision on names for the members of the National Assembly is, of course, with the members themselves'.
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which gave broad support to the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of members of the National Assembly, the "Welsh Parliament Members" or "WMPs" panel preferred, while the "MWP" option was the largest support at a public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly seem to be proposing alternative options, but it could be a problem to call for consensus for the chairman Elin Jones, who is to present a draft law within weeks.
The Reforms Act will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members of the National Assembly and on the design of the Committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may finally vote on their names in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the country name
The voters will decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to 'North Macedonia'.
The referendum was set up to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province with a similar name in Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its northern neighbour means that this right to Greek territory is raised and has repeatedly opposed its entry into the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for EU and NATO accession.
The bells of St. Martin's remain silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people with whom I spoke said in the past have given each corner a bar and a church," said Adams.
'Today there are no longer both.'
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"The social life of people today looks different," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves."
With the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders accept, and that they will “be at the beginning sooner or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums where people do not support the remaining places of refuge.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy dwellings in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these homes will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black church that held its services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem that refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when father Johnson's community members planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the bell game as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who ran the bell game in July used other words: 'A cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago changed to the larger bell game in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been happening in St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been brought along in part by the lay leaders of the church and in part by the diocese of Bishops.
In July, the head of the municipality – the municipal management body consisting of lay leaders – expressed written concerns about the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the council, although he had not been involved in the commission of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Hai injured in California 13-year-olds while diving to Lobstern
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, according to official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving after Lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 am near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the station KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry for help and paddled with several others to the boy to help draw him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy was happy to have caught a praise. Then he realized that the boy shouted “I have been bitten!
I was bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire key leg had been torn up.
"I screamed that everyone should get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'," added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been seen in the area. However, it had been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic upper body injuries.
Officials blocked the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's attacks with cosmetic departments that look like department stores that are occupied with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and debenhams.
As part of a large-scale move to the 2.8 billion British pound cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which is continuing to grow as fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments in eleven branches will be tested nationwide. If they prove successful, they will be expanded to further branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search for supermarkets for possibilities to use previously used retail space for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the scope of his cosmetic offer doubles for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops such as boats.
In addition, the supermarket is re-launching its "Boutique" make-up series, making most of the products vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly being demanded by younger customers.
In addition, perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will be testing at two Sainsbury's branch outlets. The first store was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and a second one will be opened later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has since the purchase of the chains Argos and Habitat two years ago been established in hundreds of branches Argos sales outlets and also a number of Habitat sales outlets. This has increased food sales as well as the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to rearrange its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but it ended up in the supermarkets after a discussion about the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's branches.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branch pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan as long as an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy are added in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the attractive environment and the convenient locations, we are now an attractive target for cosmetic purchases that challenges the way in which we have been shopping."
Peter Jones 'wrong' after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a business worth 11 million British pounds
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is "wrong" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a 11 million pounds deal with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessory brand True.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop.
This Morning, 37, announced their withdrawal from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered "Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company in order to focus on their own new connection contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been "wrong" when the "Golden Girl" of television at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to her new business – worth up to 1.5 million British pounds – the common homewear and accessory brand Truly could not devote enough time.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain on the way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly by far.
It should secure their future over the next decades for them in the long term.
Their decision to withdraw came as a total surprise to all concerned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch.
At the Marlow headquarters, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" presenter, one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined in March as chairman.
The couples spend the holidays together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the ITV "I'm A Celebrity" broadcast.
A source near Jones said last night: 'We're not commenting on his business matters.'
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He joked at the criticism he had from the news media about a comment that some would regard as 'non-presidential', and he looked forward to such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news moderator:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore was praised in June by Trump as a major step towards the denucleization of North Korea.
However, the de-learisation negotiations have come to a halt.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the top diplomat in North Korea, said to leading politicians from all over the world on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "equivalent reaction" from the US to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
Instead, he noted, US sanctions were in place that should maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his rally speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We stood before a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of the missile tests, support for the release of hostages and return of the mortal remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastated an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After Lombok's earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they would not be needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok were displaced, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilisation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have in many cases made it very clear that they do not want international support, so that is a bit difficult," Sumbben said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesman for the Civil Protection Agency, said that Indonesian official assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international agencies should participate in the relief.
In view of the earthquakes that Indonesia has to fight with, the country is still sadly poorly prepared for natural violence.
While Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not an everyday sight on other coastal lanes.
Despite a warning, Tsunamiwarnsirene apparently missing in Palu has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia's numerous islands is already a challenge in the best possible way.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lazarett ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster at the earliest in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the hit Indonesian infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has spent a great deal of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the Joko seeking re-election next year suffers from financing deficits.
Joko is also under pressure from continuing denominational tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practise a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes and homes when gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Viewing: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge achieves a deep balancing match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the Stamford-Bridge Stadium in London with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 back of his team in about 27 meters from the gate of Chelsea.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the back post.
The shot sailed high above the penalty room and ran into the right upper corner of the net.
Finally the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I’ve just tried to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward, so I’ve just tried to make as much time for me as possible,” Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw edge coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn’t think too much about it and just took the shot.”
After a hit in the 25th minute, Chelsea led by the Belgian Star Eden Hazard at half-time at 1:0.
The Blues storm gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprang into the Liverpool half.
Kovavic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good steep pass, so Hazard got into the penitentiary.
Hazard left the defensemen behind and closed the net with a left shot at Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool will be playing at the Champions League's group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 in the Stadium of San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will be standing at 3 p.m. in London at UEFA Europa League Videoton on Thursday.
Number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is increasing to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, as reported by the Civil Protection Agency on Sunday morning.
Many people are supposed to be trapped in the ruins of buildings that had been overthrown by the 7.5th earthquake on Friday, which caused waves of up to six metres high, the authorities spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported in a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was overcrowded with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arresting man, 32, for suspected murder, after a woman was stabbed
A murder investigation was initiated following the discovery of a female leek this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police are asking the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask everyone who has stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and seen something suspicious or heard to contact us.
I also ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have picked up something with a Dashcam, to contact us. Perhaps they have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations are ongoing, and the police reported that they are in the process of informing the next members of the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get to his apartment, but the police informed that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours to enter the building again.
It was heard by a police officer telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
She repeats again and again, 'this is so terrible'.
At 2 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the lockdown and another one before the lockdown.
Within the lockdown were several police officers monitoring the block of residence.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call number 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously under number 0800 555 111 and to refer to protocol entry 247 dated 30 September.
The Cromwell statue before Parliament becomes the latest monument subject of the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his destruction of so many cultural and religious art products by his fanatic Puritan followers, reminiscent of the Taliban.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "Tority" and "Treatment to Rewrite History".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on removing statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue was set in front of Westminster Palace.
The image storm in the British Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his forefather Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that, in the opinion of many, is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, than someone who defended Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course through the monarchy.
Whether this is a complete representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
It is certain that the conflict formed in the middle of the 17th century the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognisable figure that represents a side of this gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering them."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in southwest China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man named "Yuan" was found dead in the vicinity of a pig farm in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, with a blood-splitted artery in the vicinity of a pig farm, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs vaccines in Xining Province, Qinghai, China.
According to reports, on Wednesday he travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a nearby pig house.
He said there was a big male pig in the stable with blood on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilo pig had killed the farmers.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," the cousin was quoted by Guiyang Evening News, to whom the surname "Wu" was named.
Pictures of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market authorities negotiate compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-pound pig caught a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could steal the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a "trigger".
“They’re just playful.
They like to twist and are very curious... they're not going to hurt someone.
You only have to treat them with the right degree of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain in the southwest of the USA
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakened on the way over the colder water on the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring floods in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. east coast time, Rosa raised wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a category 1 hurricane, and was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, over the Pacific, a trog begins to form, heading eastwards to the west coast of the USA. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported northwards to the south-west of the USA.
Rosa will rain up to 25 centimetres in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture will generate large-scale rainfall in the southwest by interaction with the approaching trog.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation can cause dangerous flutarian floods, water-driven shoots, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, precipitation is expected to reach 5 to 10 cm.
Due to the spread of tropical rainfall, the possibility of flood-like floods is rapidly deteriorating.
In view of the threat of tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised to walk on foot into the desert.
Strong rainfall can lead to canyon-striking currents, and thunderstorms bring local winds as well as wind that carries dust.
The nearby trog brings locally strong rain into parts of the coast of Southern California.
It is possible to achieve a total rainfall of more than one centimetre, which may result in a small amount of shot driving in the water and smooth roadways.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first single tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widespread.
On Tuesday, strong rain spreads into the Four Corners region and stops on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S., as the Arctic cools down, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the middle of the USA.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 12 oC.
Over the next few days, the continuous summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the USA, a warm start with wide temperatures of 27 oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the USA.
Over 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, over 20 million viewers at six television networks saw the enticing statements of the Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assaults in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political patch situation continued, and the television stations interrupted their regular program on Friday due to a last-minute turn: a negotiated agreement by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, whereby the FBI is to conduct a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate's Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, that she had been distressed and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million spectators reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that broadcast the hearing, the figures were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewer numbers in offices.
In order to put this in the right perspective: This corresponds to the audience numbers at a play-off football game or at the Oscar ceremony.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaugh, recorded the highest number of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the full-day hearing.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS reported that Nielsen had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million spectators.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, on Friday morning he was filmed by cameras from CNN and CBS, as protesting him on the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee loudly harassed with words.
He stood for minutes with a lower view while being cut off. The scene was broadcast live at CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
"They have power, while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and supplemented it before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks sent live hours later when the Justice Committee was to vote on the forwarding of the nomination of Kavanaugh to the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would only do so on condition that the FBI, as requested by the democratic minority, investigate the allegations against the candidates next week.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with a friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and then with various senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with Sunday Times, accused critics of their plans to withdraw from the European Union of exploiting the future of Britain for political purposes and undermining the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Party in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In an interview with her on the newspaper's cover page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, stepped up his attack on her so-called 'Chequers plan' for Brexit by calling a proposal which provides for the reciprocal charging of customs duties by the UK and the EU 'overall absurd'.
Fatal shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained, according to the Baton Rouge police.
The authority published video footage of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As reported by the CBS partner station WAFB, the police secured the glasses at the scene and said that the glasses had been found by Simpson's DNA.
After an interview with Simpsons, the police reported that he had the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the deposit was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a wound on the neck.
The police thanked the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police Department's forensic laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional executive for 'their care and their desire for justice'.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "deeply shaken" about Wayde's death and "be in shock".
"Something like that you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Volcano feeds ash on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the volcano of Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after the activity in the crater had increased and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of riots and shocks.
Images in social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Since September 2017, geophysicists have been experiencing an earthquake of 7.1 Central Mexico, and have seen an increase in activity on the volcano 72 kilometres southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between the standby police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarist independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were held back by the standby police, threw eggs at them and also threw paint powder so that dark dust clouds developed in the streets normally populated by tourists.
The next day, too, there was a lot of handcuffs with the police who used their batons to stop the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups scanned 'no forget, no forgive' while opposed to Unionists calling 'long live Spain'.
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, however, by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
The voters had opted for independence by an overwhelming majority, although the voter turnout was low, as the anti-partisans boycotted the vote for the most part.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polling stations.
Per-independence groups had camped outdoors on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the Separatists, said he saw the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they could choose, but now we hang tight," he said.
Despite an important, though scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulties to maintain the momentum this year. Many of their most well-known leaders are either in exile or in detention, waiting for their procedures because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been suspended by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention for investigation since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for election to the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after having been rammed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been rammed by a car several times.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, the car may have been shot with an armrest.
Menga hit means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas hit proved to be crucial to Gary Holt's team being able to match Hibernian in the second half of the season.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership without a win outside this season and will be facing the Hearts next Sunday, which will be eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his winning series in the Division to six games, i.e., Chief Trainer Holt has not been defeated since his acquisition by Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against bold playing guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead for a long time before the hit, since his directness posed the rangers with the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but got slower in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he was ingested to hit Craig Halkett's head shot at the gate.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play before themselves, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive gate came about.
The Rangers allowed for a free kick, and Livingston provided a chance to put Declan Gallagher and Robinson together in a shooting position at Menga. He shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty room.
In this phase, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but they could not overcome the resistance of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unsettled.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was turned down by Rangerstor Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow led the ball past another standard situation in Livingston.
The flanks were repeatedly returned to Livingston's penitentiary and were regularly removed from the danger zone, while two required offences – one of Halkett's against the intruded Glenn Middleton and one of them for hand-playing – were denied.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were unsurpassedly excellent and exceeded the expectations of this upward trend again.
Her playing style and her team have hardly changed since returning to the top teams, but Holt owes great praise for the way in which he has awakened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on troubling throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As well as they were temporarily under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they were able to penetrate the host team – and this is something like a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Receive Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) there were smiling faces and blue sky when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons that they prevented a 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of them found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – were also listening. They condemned Erdogan’s policy as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The opposition protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and reviled by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclists die in collision with car
When a car hit, a cyclist died in London.
The collision took place around 10:15 a.m. in British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic-rich street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics looked after the man, but he died at the scene of the accident.
Months before the accident another cyclist had died in an accident with driver flight on Children Street, about 1.6 kilometres from the accident on Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and inform his next relatives.
Roadblocks and reroutes for buses are set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Latin Prison: Six officials injured in unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in unrest in a high-security prison for men.
The unrest broke on Sunday at approximately 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and is still on.
Specialised "Tornado" officials were drawn in order to end the unrest involving eight inmates who are restricted to one wing.
Officials were treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A Prison Service spokesman said: “Especially trained prison staff were deployed to repair an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that those responsible for the police will be handed over and possibly spend longer time behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, police officers were called to prison to deal with serious unrest in which the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flood-like floods (dangerous areas may benefit)
It rarely happens that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that's what will probably happen early next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the southwest of the desert and bring with them the risk of flood-like floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about flood-like floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada as well as to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will be approaching with rain on Monday evening and will move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service informed in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cycles as tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix have come close to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometres of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of between 5 and 10 centimetres with single up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other parts of the southwest of the desert, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimetres are likely to be possible and a total of up to 10 centimetres are possible.
For those who are not at risk of flood-like floods, the rainfall associated with Rosa can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, some of this rain is likely to be useful, as drought is currently raging in the south-west.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First of all, the hurricane's path means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Then the hurricane will move north with 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder waters and thus weaken.
Therefore, it is expected that Rosa will meet on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on land.
The rainfall may be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora desert, precipitation amounts of 7.5 to 15 centimetres are expected, with a maximum of 25 centimetres possible," said weather.com.
Next, as a tropical storm, Rosa will move northward over Mexico, in the early morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, will reach the border with Arizona and then, until late Tuesday evening, pass Arizona up to the south of Utah.
"The main risk is very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora desert and the desert-shaped southwest of the United States," informed the National Hurricane Center.
As a result of these rainfalls, life-threatening flutarian floods in the desert and water-prone shoots as well as landslides in mountainous areas are expected to occur.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After the find of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three boys in the teen age and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured at 4:00 a.m. in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
According to the Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials asked anyone who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered 'under the community, the anger' of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unheard of tactics of the Democrats," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during the entire nomination process Kavanaugh suffered 'under the community, the anger' of the Democrats.
Kavanaugh said Thursday before the congress and rejected the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually harassed them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also made a statement at the hearing on her charge.
The President said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in the service of the public," he said of the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
I don't take action, but in reality I take action," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission as “to resist and block.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place at the latest on Friday in the Senate, said a senior GOP leader to CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, victim numbers increase
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were flooded when the beaches were hit by a severe earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had come together on Friday at a feast on the beach of the town of Palu, when, when the darkness broke, waves up to six metres high hit the beach, and many people broke into death and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5 strength.
"When the tsunami was threatening yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run off immediately, and they fell victim to it," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency (NPCB) at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he swam with cars, tree trunks and houses, he hit everything on land," Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
Some people had climbed trees on the run from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centres in Palu.
Air shots published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released during the massive earthquake of Friday had corresponded to the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb fired at Hiroshima in World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long narrow bay the tsunami could have grown, said the authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and indicated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
According to his report, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed by the words of Nugrohos, and there was no information available.
According to a declaration by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and his staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticised for not having informed that a Tsunami Palu had hit, although the waves arrived according to official information at the time of the warning.
Amateur shots published in social media show a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns people on the street under him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall is standing on the shore and swimming buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The quake and the tsunami led to a massive power failure that disrupted communication around Palu and made the authorities more difficult to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city's airport remains closed until October and was reopened only for relief.
For Sunday, a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo to the evacuation centers in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have certainly reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in tent accommodations in the inner courtyard of their office, but after words Dosebas passed by scenes of destruction.
"They told me they had seen numerous destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief groups began their hard task of starting disaster relief, some of them agreed that skilled foreign helpers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the place of an accident has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened so far.
"At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the Tsunami of Friday fell over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing hoped for this on one of the miracles that brighten up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a wastewater channel.
On Sunday, a woman who had been trapped under debris next to her mother's body for two days was released by the rescue forces.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the beginning of this month in Indonesia to finish Asian games.
Other of the prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
"As a senior at paragliding, I have to bear my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told us how he was doing in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel among the paragliders had been sent to the competitors from Palu who took part in the beach festival.
His messages, however, led to only grey question marks instead of blue brackets.
"I think this means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thiefs steal $26,750 while filling a ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a news release by the Newport police, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee Diebe stole an employee of Brink’s to fill a cash machine $26,750.
The driver of the vehicle had cleared a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to do more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was employed, "a man came behind the staff of Brink's" and stole a bag full of money destined for the vending machines.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee from the scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
People with information on the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
At the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used him as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change is preceded by his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears in the show as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has resigned for 'emotional reasons'.
The word is not only a abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has a religious meaning for West, according to its own statement.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘du’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with Radio Moderator Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only’, only ‘Ye’ became — simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects more what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West has previously worked together, has written his name with and without bounds and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promised not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised never to apply military violence against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, "Never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square and killed 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were taking place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly grants for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training brought criminal gangs to young people.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
Given China's increased activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, although the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start given the fact that all the other countries are so far behind the US. We are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major AI success would be achieved in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the Sanovation Ventures company, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a AI system that defeated the highest-placed American Othello player. Later he was head of Microsoft Research and President of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised previous US government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked about the time of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the US often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China takes away the academic leaders, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up universities to work on AI.
In Lee's view, a modified US immigration policy could also be conducive to US AI efforts.
"I think Greencards should be offered automatically in the field of AI doctoral students," he said.
China's State Council presented its plan for the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan) in July 2017.
According to Lee's words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to grant funding to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science are to participate. In addition, the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, nothing has been done in US laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change in the country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country to 'North Macedonia', which would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim for Greek territory is raised. Therefore, Greece has lodged a veto against Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents, however, argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he was not going to vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign doubted that the voter would reach the 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth including in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, many Members have said that they will stick to the outcome so that it is decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 percent of registered voters had cast their votes.
"I'm here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum on the change of the country name that would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised mains, not through the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
In his words, a 'yes' result would be 'affirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote 'yes'.
For the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its taking over power last May.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City manoeuvring through the entire Brighton defense to achieve goal
On Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defense at the 2:0 victory of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculous in the 65th minute.
The Argentinean attacker got a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He broke between three Brighton defense players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defenseman and then overtaken several other defensemen at the edge of Brighton's penitentiary.
He then shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame him with his right shoe Brighton towerer Mathew Ryan and shot him to the right side of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We had talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he reached a goal at that moment."
It was Sterling, however, who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to control sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker aimed the ball into the net shortly before he slipped out.
City will be playing in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the Rockies game
Since the Nationals have been eliminated from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force another effort.
However, the always powerful joker hopes to stand on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies on the hill, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies who have a game lead in the NL West ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers for the Playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wild card with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere among the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably be playing at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not announced a starter for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they tend to throw jokes in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th starter, practiced on Thursday in the bullpen and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
This season's Washington law firm has a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump stops rallying in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in relation to the Brett Kavanaugh chosen by him for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones – I'm not taking action, but in reality I'm taking action, which is why I fight for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take over the power again by all means, you see the commonality, the abominableness.
It doesn't matter to them who they hurt, whom they have to cross to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission 'to resist and block'.
'And you see this in the last four days', he said and described the Democrats as 'wrong and mean and disgusting and dishonest'.
In particular, he named Senator Dianne Feinstein, the highest democrat in the Senate's Justice Committee, which triggered loud shouts in the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document go out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer allows all opinions to apply.
The party is intolerant of those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour MEPs who are told that they are not welcome – just because we are saying our opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly as she had been energetically opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for being a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy and former top politicians did not agree with.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday stated that 'all meetings should be included and productive'.
Most of the Friday evening GC sessions were just that in my eight years as a local Labour MP.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised 'more friendly, more careful' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is judged on whether it is accepted by the top party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader in the party. Colleagues with whom I previously believed to share similar political views were now expecting me to make a plea and take positions with which I would otherwise never have agreed – whether in terms of national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – a chimp raid in the social media, calling for my resignation, denounces the political centre and says that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better than some of my colleagues, since the comments I have made are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day and yet never give in to small ones.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that intimidation has become normality.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with every motion of censure and change of voting rules the party becomes more narrowly involved.
In the last two years I have often been advised to put my head on the line and not to express my opinion so clearly that I would not have 'problems'.
But I did not go to politics for that.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom in the school as a whole literally broke up, the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a councillor as well as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a hooligan out of my political views, nor at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and about areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to those who support the request of Friday: given that the country is going to fall into a Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I am sending this message not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that still so many threats or political intentions will not stop me from acting in my opinion of the best interest of you all.
Chris Leslie is MP for Nottingham East
Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Unbeated Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's premiere.
They are now the only one of the ten teams to be unhit at the top of the table.
In the end, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better chances, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been put to the test so far in our games, and we are still unbeaten, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie von Melrose said: "Recognizing Ayr, they've used their chances better than we do."
Grant Anderson’s attempt in the 14th minute, raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, due to a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been set aside for the game by the Warriors, Melrose could let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot took an unencumbered attempt.
Climo built up the leadership of Ayr with a criminal offence before reaching a hit directly at half-time and then achieved an increased attempt alone, so that it stood for Ayr at break 17:5.
Melrose, however, started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a severe injury by Ruaridh Knott, who was carried by the field. After the continuation, Ayr expanded his lead by an attempt by Climo raised by Stafford McDowall.
Then Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose paid the additional man by a non-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for talcing without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the advancing Ayr package from the crime scene.
Like almost since the break, Climo increased after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flank player Gregor Henry off for the fifth attempt of the home team.
“Still Game” star seems ready for a new career in gastronomy
“Still Game” star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change in the hospitality industry after it turned out that he was named as managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official registrations, he is Managing Director of Afahrtmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan is interested in entering Glasgow's "floring restaurant shop".
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, which is enclosed by land, hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Matroses patrol the Marine Headquarters in La Paz, decorated with masonry.
Public buildings are affected by a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Recovering it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coastal section lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still as alive as the desire to cross the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice to be taken on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and calmness and expects the result, of course, with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will follow the judgment of the IGH on large screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's demand. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate over sovereign access from Bolivia to the sea after decades of sporadic talks.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial fight for his re-election next year, there is also a lot at stake in the verdict on Monday.
"We are about to return to the Pacific shortly," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would decide in favour of Bolivia and believe that this would not change much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not entitled to address Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of any discussions.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, the fact that the judgment of the IGH was issued six months after the final appeal had been made, suggests that the case was "not complicated".
Far from supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has torn the question of access to the sea," Zárate said.
She indicated that Morales' warlike rhetoric has stifled any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their talks, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision had been taken exceptionally quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia 'has an extraordinary opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile' and an opportunity 'to put an end to the 139-year disputes for mutual benefit', he said.
Calzadilla also disputes that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the sea as a political crucifix.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to recognize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says atomic disarmament will only take place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the rival heads of state in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be coming to the fore more than three months after the summit with North Korean Head of State Kim Jong-un in Singapore just before re-launching the established nuclear diplomacy.
Ri referred to the idea that further sanctions and US resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever force the North into its knees as a "brain-spin".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first taking substantial disarmament steps.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pyongjang is serious about abandoning an arsenal where the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongjang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashionshows in Paris show the latest collections for huge headgears that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer need to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy oversized headgears for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations over the course.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a spring-like broad edge that pushed the heads of the models straight.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons, a magic hat and even an pineapple, which are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had sewn up lips and were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than to haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkelling and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge head covers could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The overdimensional hats follow directly on 'La Bomba', the straw hat with 60 cm wide, all carrying from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which hit great waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the running ladder: a beach bag made of straw that was almost as big as the model wearing a bathing suit that held the bag.
At the Paris Fashion Week, the reddish orange bass bag with bass lashes and a white leather handle was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection "La Riviera".
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect that large hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets for next summer. The designer has been so excited that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored."
John Edward: Knowledge of languages essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence. This has continued in 2018 with further outstanding exam results and is only supported by individual and joint achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community-based enterprises.
With more than 30,000 pupils from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest possible level of care for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak with someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current review results of this year show that languages with the highest rates of survival are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved grade A in the higher exams.
The data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of the students in Mandarin achieved Note A in the higher exams, while 72 percent of the students learning German, 69 percent of the students learning French, and 63 percent of the students learning Spanish also achieved Note A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered as subjects of choice as well as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other places.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for the problems of filling vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage through such a lifelong ability in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent did not speak well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for today's children that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak several languages, in particular the languages of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom with a view to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese, will be taught.
Wherever your child's interests lie, independent schools will always be able to choose a number of languages with appropriate specialised teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need for their success, as the future always looks like.
At this point in time, in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain essential to the future of the country. Therefore, this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as 'international communication'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
We have to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James take the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, waiting will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week James was asked after training for his plans for the six-game preseason game plan of the Lakers.
"I don't need preseason games in this phase of my career to prepare myself," he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of campaign demonstrations.
This is the first of Trump's five events planned for next week, including places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build up support for the upcoming half-time elections in November, as the Republicans are running the risk of losing control of the Congress.
When will Trump's rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trump's rally in West Virginia below as live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, on allegations of sexual misconduct conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains in silence for up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this series of rallying is to support Republicans who have to make difficult elections in November.
For this reason, President Trump's campaign team against Reuters announced that these five demonstrations next week will serve to "mobilize volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"The Congress's control is so important to his plans that the President will travel to as many states as possible while the operational campaign season is approaching," said a Trump election speaker who did not want to name his name to Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, "Ohio and Pennsylvania are participating and reporting media from Pittsburgh" on the rally planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016, with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the former Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to get him into the polls," said Simon Haeder, politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The team of the United States shows the willingness to fight to maintain hope for the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-parts may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
The swinging pendulum of the Momentum is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one in which the players really believe, and that especially in competitions like this.
So where is the momentum in her opinion now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now it’s four, so I think it’s a small moment for us,” said Jordan Spieth when leaving the venue.
Europe is of course in favour and has four points ahead, while twelve others follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can show three points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the cutting down to the green and is progressing with a good example.
The guttural enthusiasm screams became louder in the course of his round when he sunk an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had left behind two holes with two points.
His Putt, who chose the match on the 15th hole for them, triggered a similar scream, which suggests that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"I really have to get in and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That's all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days as the only player to write the story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's uneven but friendly duo is four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who didn't hit Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and at the back nine holes on Friday morning Bogeys.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the quantity of outcasts confirms that they are the players to be beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who would be able to win a possible European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
Speaking of European glory, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-year hero of the morning who played together with Alex Noren.
One Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spanish and Sweden into a clamp that they could not get close to.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of trouble.
The four and four pairs are so fascinatingly close to each other because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way in which a strategy can change quickly.
Europeans have so far played better as a team and are clearly in the lead on the last day. However, this fourth round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is ahead after the fours and four-parts from Saturday to the US with 10:6 and goes with a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the difficult Tiger Woods and was able to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wanted to win back the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the four in the morning over the faulty American team and won the series at 3:1.
In the four-parts, the USA made more resistance and won two matches, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve singles played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points in a row as the first European newcomer, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend "Molliwood", only won four points in their four opening matches as a second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmoniously and beat the debauched Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more powerful 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged by two matches on Saturday, had his brilliance flashed up occasionally, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning during the four, returned and played the four-parts as partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris, not everything ran according to their ideas.
The three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a tough 2&1 win over the Spanish-playing Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 games after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup it has only occurred twice that a team came back after it had gone into the individual with a gap of four points. However, as the title holder for Furyk’s team a decision is enough to keep the trophy.
After they have been in second place for two days, it doesn't look as if they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday before the United Nations that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea had, last year, taken "essential steps" on the basis of good will. For example, it stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and undertook not to increase nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We do not see a corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances we will in no way be unilateral first."
While Ri was familiar with North Korea’s complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase” approach to denucleization, where North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denucleization from the outset as it had done in the past by Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit meeting between a US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. In this, Kim had assured him to work on the "denucleization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump offered guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is aiming for an official end to the Korean war between 1950 and 1953, while the United States has said that Pyongjang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes calls for a relaxation of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'first denucleization' and increases pressure by sanctions to reach its goal by force, and is even opposed to the 'clarification of the end of war'," said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into our knees is a brain-spin of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not go into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. Head of State had emphasized at the UN at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were the other party to the denucleization issue instead of the US, the denucleization of the Korean peninsula would not have brought about this halt."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech differed greatly from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the mainland of the United States with North Korea rockets after "the evil president" Trump Kim had called "the rocket man" on suicide mission.
This year Trump, who had threatened with the “full destruction” of North Korea last year, overtook Kim at the United Nations with praise for his courage to take disarmament steps. However, he said there was still much work to be done and the sanctions had to remain in force until the denucleization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for it: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must definitely continue vigorously until we have achieved complete, final and verified denuklearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry out Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongjang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, when he left Pjongjang, he said that progress had been made only to be accused by North Korea hours later of having made "gait-like demands".
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon, to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex when the United States took 'acceptable measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'corresponding measures' were security guarantees that Trump had given in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course, enough to sleep
A new course at Harvard University will make sure that all students get more sleep during their basic studies this year. This is a measure against the growing macho culture to keep up with caffeine and learn all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention to themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is, in his opinion, the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after having given a lecture on the effects of withdrawal from sleep on learning.
“ At the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘ Why do I experience it only now, in my last year? ’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
This year's course for the first time explained to the students how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after it had found that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, the students see the image of a room in a dormitory and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books. They receive information on the effects of caffeine and light as well as on the effects of lack of sleep on the sporty performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
They are then encouraged by means of a map of the university campus with interactive symbols to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just like you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The pride in pushing a "night shift" was still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep a growing problem.
To ensure good sleep, he said the "secret weapon" of all students should be against stress, exhaustion and anxiety. Furthermore, it would be possible to avoid weight gain, as sleep withdrawal would put the brain in starvation, so that it would be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course. Last year he had completed one of his courses in Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to press for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before they start their studies at the competition-oriented university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, the students should be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light, which comes from electronic screens and LED lighting, and can turn the circus rhythm off. This leads to trouble sleeping.
Livingston against Rangers 1:0: Menga Tower Conquers Gerrards Players
The Rangers lost another away game, when Dolly Menga's match for Steven Gerrards meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's first second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team with eight points behind the remote leading hearts in the Ladbrokes premiere.
Menga met seven minutes before the half-time, and the uninspirable Rangers seemed to have no chance to compensate.
While the Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston is in third place and is only behind Hibernian.
The Rangers are also threatened by further trouble, after Line Adjuster Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an apparently thrown object out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtaken Ayr and reached the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same eleven Livingston players who took the Hearts a point last week, and would have to be enthusiastic about how his well-trained team kept their opponent on track and under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball possession, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
They should have reached a goal after only two minutes, when Menga's first handoff Scott Pittman led to Allan McGregors' goal. However, the midfielder missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot by the back post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convincing in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos obviously believed that after a quarter of an hour of collision he should have received a penalty, but referee Steven Thomson did not allow the Colombian's complaints.
In the first half of the season, the Rangers only get two goal shots, but the former Ibrox goaltender Liam Kelly had hardly any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a thorny shot by Oviedo Ejaria.
Although Livingston's score might not match the game in the 34th minute, it is not to be denied that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers could not deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted half-time and exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change was almost immediately effective when the wing player Morelos put in position, but the impressive Kelly paused from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to bring the guests to play exactly the game that lies with them, where Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor stood up and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton also demanded a late penalty for a bunch of Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the violin counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning"-Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger counters.
The Geiger counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: “This is a violin counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "I do hear a knock!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention, which bears his name, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" denatured cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy debarred cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine contributes to the immune system to detect denatured cells.
In this method, immune cells are removed from a patient's laboratory.
These cells can see a large number of cancerous types of common protein and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to detect debarked cells, disappeared for more than 18 months.
In this method, immune cells are taken from a patient, which are changed in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein HER2 common to many types of cancer, and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "encourages the growth of various types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are removed from immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West launched a Pro-Trump-Tirad after his appearance at SNL, carrying a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was shown at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he praised US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to be presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, Ghost Town, carrying a Make-Americana-Great-Again cap, he continued with a chimp canonade against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s Rassist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which Hollywoodstar laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West's Schimpftrade was not sent, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the West release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had difficulties behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They harassed me behind the stage.
They said, ‘ don’t go out with the cap. ’
You harassed me!
And then they say I was in a sunken area," he said to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said he would "dress my superman cape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His remarks triggered at least twice out of the audience, and SNL contributors were embarrassingly touched, reported Variety. One person said to the magazine: "It was deadstill in the studio."
West had been forced to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West confused many with a presentation of the title "I Love It", in which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, director of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: DANKE, THAT YOU HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED."
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward anyone who, in my opinion, makes himself or herself an ideology harmful to my community (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same applies to us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The being formally known as Kanye West" (the being officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Know As Prince".

The charges are reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said such roles on the screen would often have the feeling of having to be strong in order to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture," Harington said that he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married the Rose Leslie, who is also a member of the Game of Thrones, and also 31, admitted that the solution to the problem was "very important".
"I personally find the question very important at the moment, what went wrong with malehood," he said.
"What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now seeing?"
Harington believes that due to the very masculine character, television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes boys feel like having to embodiment this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the great questions of our time: how do we change this?
For in the case of the young men something has clearly gone wrong."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of "Game of Thrones" next summer. He had "fit of battlefields and horses".
From November on Harington will be shown in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently told us that he had been the best of "Game of Thrones" when he met his wife Rose.
"I have met my wife on this mission, so I have received my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the famous fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow, with numerous Emmys.
In June 2018, they married Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In contrast to the past, the transfer took place in the vast majority of new cases through sex.
To date, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people thus infected with HIV had been reduced to almost zero, and Chinese health officials gave up at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, by year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission by sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is to be widespread.
Based on the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men ultimately marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection of sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been promising, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees let the data of the GOP transmitters leak, criticises "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, contests on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
The Los Angeles democrat expressed the view that the claims of "ultra-judicial" experts and websites would be disseminated.
"Lies, lies, and even more abominable lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information should include the private addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. During the hearing of a Senate committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district raised against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The release took place after the three Senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of contributions was assigned to Waters’ office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie," said Waters.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for the search of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly triggered criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This Dementi is angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congressman.
People who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They shall not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They must be quiet and left alone."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angryly during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who starts the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters stated in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous for all the members of my staff."
Review of "Johnny English – One lives only three times" – weak espionage parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for Brexit references in every British-colored new film. This also seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy parade franchise "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with "Johnny English – Der Spion die sebende" and relived in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now Just" stutteringly.
Will an ironic self-parody on the issue of how obviously we are shy become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, for the second time, Johnny English’s license of gloomy, grimaginal cutting and incompetently masquerade was extended. His name more than anything else indicates that he is a general comic creation for cinema visitors in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he is again the conspired secret agent, who strangely thinks he's cool and worldly, while in reality he consists of some clouseau, a prix Mr. Bean and a knock of this guy who contributed a single note to the title melody of "The Hour of the Winner" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the figure was originally based on chaos left behind by travellers and international secret agents who played the Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly hung on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics is evident, but humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the 'serious' film series such as '007' and 'Mission Impossible' now offer self-assured comical elements.
The humor seems to be directed more at children than at adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy misdeeds are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gigs in the role of Bean.
The ever-present premise is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spying network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, much to the failure of the serving agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and distressed figure who is already facing the complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi Teresa May character, but the script doesn't give much to work with
Their secret services advisors inform them that all active spies have been detangled and therefore they have to get someone out of retirement.
This also includes Johnny English himself, who is now working as a teacher at a sending institution, but is teaching unofficially in the work as an undercover agent. There are a few gigs, because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
Deutsch will be brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested partner Bough, who will be replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-boat commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything terrible wrong in the secret service of your Majesty, are back in action. They meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman Fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is in danger of being banned by a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough begin their Odyssey of grotesque late: As waiters disguised, they set fire to a chic French restaurant, they provide chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Voltas luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the inside of Voltas House with the help of a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all the registers are drawn, but she is so kind and funny, the topic is already dealt with in detail on children's television.
Pretty moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself: "Can't the British film industry Rowan Atkinson play a role that really does justice to his talent?"
Labour denies to work on a plan for the British to work four days a week, but is to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that foresees that the British will work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
According to reports, business leaders want to pass on to employees the savings achieved by the AI (Artificial Intelligence) revolution in the form of an additional day off.
This would give employees a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to the sources, the idea 'fits' the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
'A change will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort consistent with the party's approach to restoring the economic balance for the benefit of workers and the party's general industrial policy strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the general election campaign 2017.
At present, however, the Labour Party does not support the approach.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A 4-day week is not party politics and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concreted in the Labour Conference last week his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonym directors" and "profitmakers" in public utilities.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not be able to recover their entire share, as a Labour government could do 'reductions' due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the plans to appoint employees to the executive boards of companies and set up inclusive ownership funds to hand over 10% of private companies' equity to employees who collect annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy comment in the 60-minute news magazine whether the FBI's investigation in the case of Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Republican Senators Authority could influence in order to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light, which could ultimately change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I announced in the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined, and unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be chiseled in stone.
"My opinion is certain about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to burst a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett fought this vehemently," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who called it could not confirm it."
It's 36 years now.
And I can't detect any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was helped to reduce poverty as part of this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year for the seventh time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group tries to fight poverty by encouraging more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to do a number of tasks, including actions such as volunteering, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by email or telephone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizens remain 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of expecting a cool free concert, a sensible way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizens reported that since 2011, the project has seen more than 19 million actions by its supporters and has achieved various goals.
These actions will have helped to encourage leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than 37 billion dollars that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the funds secured so far have direct effects on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million to fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, following more than 5,000 actions, with which the UK was invited to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, what are the reasons why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They replied: “It will be a long and exhausting way with heights and depths.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful, as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who perform at this year’s event in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are also presenters.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to prevent Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examines, if necessary, Washington can rely on the Navy to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach markets including the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Minister of the Interior.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is a pretext to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently operating at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
"I think the real reason for the use of Russia in the Middle East is the negotiation of new markets in energy, just as in Eastern Europe," he allegedly said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea roads remain open and, if necessary, block them in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the participants in the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as "the voice of electricity consumers" in the US.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are virtually identical.
'The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia', he said, while calling Russia 'One Trick Pony' with a fossil fuel dependent economy.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was expanding the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, the government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became Moscow's "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2-Pipeline worth US$11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all think that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has asked the US to stand out from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem if a third country is involved in our energy supply," says BDI's director Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "investigate" a presidential candidate for 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
On Saturday, the Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced that she would "check" a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During a Town Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidateship.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to 'exactly examine' a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about Donald Trump dealing with our democracy," she said.
Warren did not say anything about her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, before the vote, an FBI investigation is needed.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that they should be candidates for 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe survey, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not apply.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidate for former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent in favour of a potential candidate, and 48 percent opposed.
Among the other names of prominent democrats who come into question in view of a possible candidateship for 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator von Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would officially decide until January.
Sarah Palin expresses herself on the Donald Trump rally for posttraumatic stress disorder, suffering from the track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through, when he comes back, all this can be felt by other families who feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds that our soldiers are going back with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as "Elefant in Space" and said about her son and other war veterans that they have changed their return, that they have come back miserably, that they are coming back and wondering if there is this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military have given the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 Federal States and D.C. support a remedy for the new asylum policy
18 federal states and the District of Columbia support a remedy to the new US policy that refuses asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 federal states and the district submitted a court expert statement on Friday in Washington, D.C., to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace-to-session complaint filed by the American Civil Freedoms Union in August against federal policy was not announced.
She reported that her partner “and his violent gangsons” abused her, but U.S. officials refused their asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations that have major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US-Asylpolitik lifted a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants on the run from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Federal Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy " ignores decades of legislation at state, state and international level".
"The Federal Act provides that all asylum applications are assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and this court violates this principle," was stated in the court expert statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that policies that deny immigrants access to the country have an adverse impact on the economy in the US, since immigrants could be more active as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labour force.
In June, Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
"Asyl exists for all those who leave their home country because they are persecuted or for fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political belief," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the intention to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world, by granting asylum.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubles with time
For the survivors, the situation became worse and worse.
"It's all very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance with dead comes.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to gather their entire wealth and wealth, and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the employees of the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 earthquake, were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured people, including Dwi Haris, who reached vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated in the outdoors because of the persistent severe aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the intense earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went way too fast.
I think I was trapped under the wall," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s calls for help, but then there was rest.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place."
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper had sent out a four-page announcement in an American newspaper announcing the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of exploiting the American press for proganda purposes.
USA Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of engaging in the US Congress elections on November 6th, an accusation that China is denying.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in US elections are in line with U.S. officials' announcement to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
Chinese retaliatory duties at the beginning of the trade war were to be met by exporters in states such as Iowa that supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-standing Governor of Iowa, who is largely exporting agricultural products to China, reported that Beijing workers, farmers, and companies have damaged.
China, according to Branstad in an opinion in Des Moines Register vom Sonntag, now doubles this tyranny by placing propaganda ads in its own free press in the USA.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the proven tradition of freedom of expression and independent press in America by switching off paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," says Branstad.
"In contrast, you will only find limited votes against the newspaper skis here in Beijing and do not really reflect the different opinions that the Chinese might have about the disturbing economic development of China, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but he did not call the newspaper's name.
Republicans marvel at voters before the intermediate elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the forthcoming interim elections, which could be made especially by women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already indicated that they continue with a vote.
"Such things can't be reversed," said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last minute incident was sufficient for an FBI investigation to relieve angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national speaker on Friday for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters in the hall of the Senate called "November is coming!" when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold on to the nomination of Kavanaughs and that despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation were an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer on the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially for female voters in the suburbs and for younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't choose."
Even before Ford's public statement, in which their allegations of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers suggested that a counter-reaction might result if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
"This situation is a messy mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
'It is not just a question of voting the body, of final voting or of reviewing Kavanaughs; it is also about the way in which the Republicans dealt with it and how they dealt with it', Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to disagree with who they are supposed to believe on the basis of the statements made by Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly greater proportion on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they definitely or probably gave Kavanaugh faith.
In addition, 38% indicated that they considered that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied to his statement, while 30% indicated the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made an affidavit to the Senate Justice Committee that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently bringing a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid von Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee gave the best that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
"We have to get active now," he said on the issue of startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable users to create their own personal online data storage or POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for the private and corporate sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide alone who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal reinforcement and development via data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind this is that the company uses resources, processes and corresponding capabilities to ensure that solid is available to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
With the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not exchange information with Facebook and Google on whether to make a comprehensive change that will completely transform their entire business models overnight.
"We do not ask their permission."
In a post on a medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid web.
In 1994 Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a major participant in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, holder of the Victorian Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Victorian Cross during the First World War was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Lieutenant and priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his efforts in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharp shooter and never experienced that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the hero act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, through dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later he urged the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", led the line forward before rushing forward with a single military weapon and shutting down three of the military units.
Lieutenant Vann was shot by a German gunman on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something he could never do, and at the same time something that would make one humble.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid down a crane after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honoured to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the bravery of a true hero became visible above all through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main card, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the UK audience did not surprise to see Pepa Pig suddenly.
Some remained untouched after they remained awake until early morning hours to see the fight in particular.
A fan described the switch to the cartoon character on Twitter as a kind of bad joke.
"As a result of government regulations, these content is not considered to be youth-free, so that it had to be changed to a children's program at 6 a.m.," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President Marketing and Communication at Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The CEO of Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will work on the roadmap to take into account viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think the problem could have been solved by the game," he said.
“But it’s 6 o’clock in the morning on a Sunday at spectators in the UK, and we won’t solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay on it.
There was quite a lot of communication during the change. It went very well and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that this is a technical disturbance.
What was not the case was a problem from the government.
I promise this won't happen again.
We will reduce this to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we have tried to offer fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels depressed about sexuality
Tom Daley, who participated as a water jumper in various Olympic games, says that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at the secondary school that he is different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he had spoken out on the subject of gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victories in the Olympic Games are no longer so important to him.
The actual presenter of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses due to illness for a few months.
In Laverne's first show, he said that he considered himself to be inferior to others earlier, since love for boys and girls was socially unacceptable.
He said: 'Until today, feeling that others are inferior and different from others is the reason for my power and strength and, ultimately, for my success.'
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The double bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he had spoken on this issue because, fortunately, he could live without restrictions and without discrimination and wanted to encourage others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference had never been a topic.
He says if you had to go through so much as a child and a teenager – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple has had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his entire view has changed ever since.
Last year, he'd have spent all his time on gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 after the diagnosis of brain tumor at the age of 40.
Daley said that his father did not accept the nearing death, and one of the last things he asked about was the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be at the forefront.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"I only knew it had always been my dream to dive in front of the local audience at Olympic Games – that was madness," he said.
His first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by it. He heard the song in advance of the Olympic Games and still cared for goose skin.

Mickelson, who is not currently in shape, sits at the Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bench
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record at his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to make a great effort so that the whole thing doesn't turn into a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the replacement bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the event, the five-time major winner spent his day cheering others and working at his game, hoping to fix the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf national golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself wasn't discouraging enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open-Champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, a newcomer at these tournaments to win all four games this week.
If the Americans put a hot start with four points behind in the 12 singles, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Furyk was confident in Mickelson and could not add much to that either.
"He was perfectly clear about his role today, gave me a flap on my back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He has quite a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world's best known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week as well.
I didn't think he was at two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it happened and that's what we expected.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson will record Nick Faldos for most of the Sunday-run Ryder Cup games.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup racetrack that never quite matched the highlights of its personal record.
Mickelson scored 18 victories, had 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that the team had already enriched its presence alone.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original, and he likes to have a few dinners, and he's a great person who's popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit closer this week. It was fun watching them.
He is a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can soon be over with the lead
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballestero had a lead of five points against the Americans, but only just came across the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead and achieved a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“The idea remains that we had a big advantage in Valderrama, we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that only barely,” said Bjørn ( pictured in the photo) after he saw the win 5–3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all team members that it is not over.
It's going to be okay tomorrow.
Get in the shit and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is over only when the points are on the display board.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I've always said I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're fully aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Bjorn continued: “I would never fall over the performance of his players in a difficult golf course.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual benefits are at the forefront and this is a completely different matter.
It's great to work with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, you'll be tested to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make that clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will be careful that his players cut each other better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those great turnarounds on the last tournament day. He was on the winning side in Brookline before he was on the side of the losers after Europe's 'Wunder of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word," he replied on the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take off the quick start you’ve seen in Brookline and in Medina.
When the momentum strikes in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to spell tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task to pick up for the counterstroke, he had to compete against Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the rankings.
"I chose the boys in this order because I think it covers everything," says Bjorn about his selection for the individual events.
Germany's new warship again delayed
The latest fregatte of the German Navy should have been put into service already in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. However, according to local media, it will only be delivered at the earliest next year due to faulty systems and fast-growing costs.
The start-up of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the brand new Fregaten of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the time that a military speaker called himself.
The ship should have been put into service already in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after extradition.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, which were already ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old Fregats of the Bremen-Class.
They are intended to contain a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and marine target aircraft, as well as core technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature are longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays may cause the state-of-the-art warships that Germany is supposed to represent as a sea force to become obsolete at the time of their entry into service, says Die Zeit.
The F125, who was persecuted by the accident, hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship off and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship after its delivery to the shipyard.
There was little mention of the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of important "software and hardware errors" which the new ship would have rendered unusable in a conflict situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older Fregaten of the Bremen class.
It has also been announced that the ship is far too difficult, leading to a loss of performance and that the Navy can in future take rehabilitation measures.
The 7000 tonnes of "Rheinland-Pfalz" were apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class, which were used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, also became a problem.
It seems that the costs increased to €3.1 billion compared to the €2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Wehrmader of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the Navy “is leaving the ships capable of operation”.
Mr Bartels said that the problem had increased over time, since old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the Fregaten of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In an estate in the highlands of Scotland, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape to search for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insight into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future nature conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track dwarfs and mosquitoes, as well as the brown Langohr and water fleas in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and which species does what.
A map and a report of the habitat will then be created to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of the measures for the management of the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and to show how forest areas can be preserved for bats and other related species.
The stocks of bats in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to loss of habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-catchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo location to detect insects and obstacles in their runway.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across Scotland, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out examinations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even set up Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for her.
"Here in Threave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats yet, which is why we are doing these works here and in other goods, which will help us to learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable."
He stressed the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance in the goods, since it was possible that the accidental destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and extinguish the entire population on site.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and we do not know how many of our species are concerned with their populations."
Ronaldo contests rape charges, while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to rape charges raised against him as "Fake News" and said that by using his name people want to become "famous".
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine The Mirror that published the accusations.
The storm of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of having raped an American named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
He allegedly paid her 375,000 dollars to buy her silence on the incident, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a Instagram live video of its 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their release as "Fake News."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News", said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or in the camera.
“You want to profile yourself by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror for the accusations they referred to as "inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy".
Counsel Christian Schertz said that the player demanded compensation for “moral damages equal to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident is supposed to have occurred in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub club, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, he allegedly raped them.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to her knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent a good guy" who was "one percent".
In the documents it is claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it was agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later entered into an out-of-court agreement because she had "fear of retribution" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that she was now trying to cancel the agreement as she was still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged incident, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer, in a 100 million Euro deal, he moved to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “repent the loss of car manufacturers forever”
The United Kingdom would 'forever regret' it if, after Brexit, it lost its status as a world-leading car manufacturer, said Minister for Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He further said that it was "careful" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby should Britain leave the EU.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border on a no-deal brexite could lead to job losses.
Last year, the factory in Burnaston, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis product lines are produced, manufactured nearly 150,000 vehicles, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience production stops at an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised fears about a hard EU exit without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its mini-works in Oxford after Brexit for one month.
According to the car manufacturers, the main concerns relate to risks within the supply chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
If the UK left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be disruptions at the borders which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
For Toyota, it was impossible to operate a warehouse at the Derbyshire plant that lasted longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark stated that Theresa May's Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU is "exactly designed to avoid such border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that enables us to enjoy not only the current success, but also to take this opportunity," he explained in the BBC Radio 4's Today show.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest member of the Unite trade union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, these jobs never come back once they are gone.
One government speaker said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU'.
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed according to information from the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "by another week", while the dispute over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, it was said on Sunday from the White House.
Rosenstein has examined the work of the Special Rapporteur Robert Mueller, who is investigating the election interventions by Russia, the connections between Trump's consultants and Russia, and a possible judicial impediment by the President.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thereby endanger Mueller's independence was the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was addressing the possibility of secret recording his conversations with Trump as well as the president's removal from office with the help of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports about his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was held at the UN General Assembly in New York at that time, was announced for next Thursday,
Trump stated that he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid it colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
She replied to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set for this. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed for another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her about the reason.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of press conferences did not place an aversion to the TV reporter's 'effect hashing', but admitted: 'I would not deny that they are doing effect hashing'.
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President makes more rounds of questions and answers than any President before him," she said, without giving any precise evidence: 'We have looked at these figures.'
There will still be press conferences, says Sanders, however, “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States direct questions, but far better than to talk to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen that we have done it often in the last few weeks. This will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he had a bizarre appearance, running out of the row before the reporters assembled before.
Health Minister writes about Brexit concerns about EU workers in the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health is addressing people from outside the EU working in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and wish to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK quit the EU.
The Scottish Government has already stated its willingness to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland's decentralised public service.
Freeman wrote in your letter: “During the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the UK government has also strengthened preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the worrying times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency surgery after a head injury
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christon Abercrombie was, according to reports by Mike Organ of Tennessee State after a head injury, which he received on Saturday during the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, undergoing an emergency operation.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," says Reed.
Trainer and medical staff supplied abercrombie on the sideline with oxygen before it was placed on a carrier and removed for further investigations.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details on the nature or extent of the injury yet are known” and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called red shirt, plays at Tennessee State in his first season after he changed from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 games, bringing his total number to 18 in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the UK
In the future, foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom.
This step is intended to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in stamping fee will concern all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, with multiple revenues to benefit homeless people.
This step is an attempt to limit Jeremy Corbyn's success to young voters who promise to provide more affordable housing and take top earners into the eye.
The increase in stamp tax is levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenue is to be paid to the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is levied in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on second-term apartments and residential properties left for rent, could amount to up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not based in the United Kingdom. As a result, prices will be raised and it will be more difficult for first-time buyers to take a foothold in the real estate business.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become 'spirit cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has voted in favour of a reduction in stamp tax in order to allow more young people the first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping up real estate prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to end Britain's "housing shame".
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a striking series of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a rental price commitment to a ban on non-mute premises.
He also wants to give city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving life from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be right that for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, it is just as easy to buy real estate as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of homelessness has become too far away for too many people, and the unworthyness of homelessness remains too great a problem."
Jack Ross: “My biggest goal is to manage Scotland”
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that it is his ‘greatest goal’ to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot has the challenge to breathe new life into the club from the North East of England, which is currently in third place in League One and lacks three points at the top.
He moved to the stage of light this summer after he led St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I made it to the bank and that was it," Ross told the show Sports Sound from BBC Scotland.
“But I have often seen Scotland play in Hampden as a child with my father and this is something that always pulls me back.
However, this option would only come if I were successful in association management."
Ross' predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic claimed not to be afraid to step into the footsteps of such established names at such a club after he previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities of this association, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he explained.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I'd probably only appreciate my time here as a success if I brought the club back there."
Ross can only present a three-year management career, after a phase as deputy manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month job as a coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the delegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the delegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says that he feels better now than ever before in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"This must have been a real divorce," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds funny because I didn't feel bad about it, could live well from it and experienced some very pleasant high-phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still do this in terms of stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I do. I've never felt so well in my skin in my whole life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is on Saturday at 5:30 pm, so a study
The heat wave in summer has missed a boost in the revenues of Britain's crisising pubs, while restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies grew by 2.7 per cent in July. According to statistics, however, revenues from restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the company consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, stated: “Sustainable sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the football world championship meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, where Pubs could record sales increases of 2.8 percent. However, the restaurant was even harder.
The 1.8 per cent decline recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on beverages showed by far the best performance, with a surface-adjusted sales trend that increased higher than it was at the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to have a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, of the RSM analysts for leisure and restaurants, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for out-of-home market sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but revenue losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year, in addition to sustained cost pressures, will be particularly painful.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies focusing on food and it remains to be seen whether the more moderate temperatures in August will provide the much needed breathing break."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Couffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with combined sales of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret social media accounts that hide it from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret social media accounts that keep it secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of fewer than 20,000 pupils in secondary schools has found an increase on so-called 'Fake Insta' pages.
The news cheers fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a 'main account' to show their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, created accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of under 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a link to the photo sharing website Instagram.
The news cheers fears that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of the students said they own a clean 'main account' that they can show their parents, but also own private accounts.
One mother, who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who urged others to "infect me."
The study conducted by the Independent Schools' Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of the 11-18 year olds had two profiles, half of which admitted owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online rooms where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the voice of athletes in the Scottish sports council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Association Council at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most excellent athlete and the chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports professionals to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, Great Britain and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from their choice in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the distance over 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta has a total of four Olympic gold medals in his own name and has often appeared today as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a temporary bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can say if or how far I will be healed.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you very much for the encouraging news!"
Advertising for milk pumps comparing mothers with cows ensures excitement in the network
A milk pump manufacturer caused excitement in the network with an advertising clip in which breast-feeding mothers are compared with the milking of cows.
To introduce the 'first low-noise milk pump' on the market, the manufacturer of consumer technology, Elvie, published a non-serious music video in order to emphasize the freedom of mothers who are breast-feeding.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with hay with cows in the background to a song that contains text lines like: 'Yes, I'm milking, but you see no cock' or 'if you haven't noticed it, these aren't udders but my breasts.'
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy on the web.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say that the "frights" of the dairy industry are harmless.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Just as we do, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away from them within a few days of birth," said one comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Perceptible traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: 'such a non-realistic advertising'.
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that you found the song "urcomic".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
When I was pumping off, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: "This is a funny advertisement directed at mothers who use milk pumps (often in the workplace or on toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the recognition that many women who use milk pumps indicate that they feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely noiseless, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a bold and provocative market introduction.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges associated with them, while at the same time presenting the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump allows.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has gotten into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared on the Catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly and quietly taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of internally displaced children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, including increased rhetoric and measures by the Trump government made it more difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become themselves the target for expulsion when they register to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Customs Authority, stated before the Congress that the authority arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons did not have previous entries in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of the people who are either their own guardian or a member of a guardian’s household are illegally staying in the country and a large part of them are criminals.
That's why we're going to keep following these people," said Albence.
In order to speed up the processing of children's cases, the officials introduced new rules, which according to the staff of the accommodation in some children, require to appear within one month instead of 60 days after the arrest, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video support and not personally in order to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
If negative decisions are taken, the person is quickly deported.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is to be, according to information from the housing staff, as well as reports that have become known in the last month from the system, that they are frightened and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreaks.
Proponents say that these concerns are reinforced in a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems, due to the size are more easily overlooked.
They also explained that it can strengthen trauma, in which many of the children are already suffering, if they are taken to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish “occupiers” to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil with the pretext of fighting terrorism and are “treated accordingly”.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more people have been expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus 'will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned' of terrorist groups as well as 'any illegal foreign presence'.
The United States has stationed around 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly trained and advised both Kurdish armed forces and Syrian Arabs, who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were met and accused some "Western countries" of spreading "irrational fears" to keep the refugees from going home.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to allow return," he said.
'They are politicalizing a purely humanitarian matter'.
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid would be granted to Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel high castle Idlib represented the possibility of pre-empting political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned away a wide-ranging offensive of Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had 'clear deadlines' and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front allied with Al-Qaeda, would be 'deleted'.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee, which consists of members of the government and the opposition, in order to design a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem referred to the Syrian government's conditions of participation in the committee and stated that his work should be limited to the "revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Reelection
With this logic Trump would win his re-election in 2020, as many liberal spectators probably hope, not to prematurely end an official election or scandal.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time'.
So far, there's no sign that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, the turn-on rates for CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million at the best time and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reached an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the turnout rates to 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with important news.
"This is like a fire that attracts people magically, because it's something we don't understand," says Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series "Designated Survival" broadcast on the TV station ABC, about a cabinet member who will be president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scout, an old comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him about the reason.
“He said, ‘ Because he makes me laugh, ‘ Scovel told me.
The chaos is worth a visit.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible combination of families and the health of the global economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it is also a matter of being an informed citizen when one becomes aware of having been looking at an expert round for six hours, using sources from the so-called 'Deep Background' for his book 'Fear', Paul Manafort's 15,000 dollar expensive bomber jacket made of straw leather (according to Washington Post a 'dress piece rich in self-examining') or the effects of Stormy Daniel's raging description of Trumps, umm, anatomy.
For my part, I will never see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
"A part of what he's doing can be felt like a reality show he's introducing to every evening," says Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive Officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series "The Three of the Pfandhaus", about Trump's rotating occupation and daily activities (break a dispute with the football league NFL from the fence, praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a episode, or you can't come with me anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crammed inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn't get away from the screen, not if Judge Candidate Brett Kavanaugh was just ahead of saying what was going on before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people said ‘This is the beginning of the Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought that was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Donation funds flood the narrowest races around seats in Congress at the intermediate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania is flooded by donations, thanks to the newly drawn limits of the electoral districts, which led to two officials standing around the same seat in the race.
The newly-signed pre-city district in Pittsburgh is launching the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb is opposed to another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly overlapping with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-signed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were destroyed and manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district resulted in an exchange of votes between the parties' major financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a much observed special election in March around the 18th constituency of the state.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and Trump won the lead with 20 percentage points.
Political experts give the Democrats an easy lead.
The U.S. tested El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then left back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized it without having encountered great resistance from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with the president of Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama as a partner to throw out the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the U.S. Foreign Ministry decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan any longer", said Heather Nauert, spokesman for the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador was consideration given to criminal measures that received an estimated $140 million in aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity that should follow a similar meeting last year and represented a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from moving towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus effectively ended the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October, in order to give diplomatic indications of the importance that the Assembly government can attach to it.
The three American diplomatic representatives have quietly and quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any further suffocation or punishment from Washington.
A John Bolton government speaker rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak at internal meetings under the condition of anonymity.
Their opinions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next major surprise could be the report by the Special Rapporteur, Robert Mueller, on Trump's possible legal disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in public.
Mueller is now also allegedly investigating whether Trump's electoral team has conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
Should the majority of the Congresses change, Trump would see himself confronted with an organ that would force him to be accountable exactly at the time when he passed by to stand before the voters again; and possibly before a jury of judges.
These are many ‘ifs’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterpart, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the incessant march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are currently facing several such turning points.
What do we do when Trump dismisses Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on Mueller's future investigation?
Rosenstein has been in devil's kitchen since this newspaper last year telling us that he suggested that the president should be recorded secretly and that he speculated that the upper part of the office would be inappropriate.
Rosenstein denied the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed in office despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false speech?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we will have a long winter ahead.
But I think we will not fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that had once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me out 60 years later to set off sabbaticals on the table with the hook cross.
How can I not be optimistic about this heritage?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistically before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remiss against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put it in a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the European League.
As a result of a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to 2-2 equal position against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger ones.
"This was an important point for us, because Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we could do something about it and we went home with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall a decision was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we were in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a heavy game, as they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that we can go through this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is some kind of feeling of well-being.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Fear of old-age care leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few of them talked about it with their family members.
Approximately half of the participants in the Nationwide Study said they would talk to your spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Wide Life Insurance Sector.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't express your wishes in time.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to finance this expenditure.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Submit legal disputes at the last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority to instruct a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals comply with your wishes, should you be unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You select a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your invoices are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so you are ready.
"Not just the financial issues play a role. Who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What is medical treatment?"
Who takes care of the dog?

Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with air gun
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in the forties, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot into the chest, the belly and the hand.
Officials described the shootings that took place at about 02:30 British time as an arbitrary act.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, says the authorities.
Due to the failure of communication systems, relief personnel were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, which is located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami took place.
Dongglala is a county located in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi, about 300 km (180 miles) long.
In 2017, an estimated 299,200 people were living in the district, which is an administrative unit below the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue for the Central Sulawesis economy, particularly the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Civil Protection Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Ring, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatras triggered a tsunami on 26 December, which hit 14 countries and cost 226,000 people lives in the Indian Ocean coastal areas, almost half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the western coast of Sumatras between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias islands off the coast of Sumatras.
2006: An earthquake with the strength of 6.8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with the strength of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the strength of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands before Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and demanding about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shaken the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died by falling buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, which is popular with tourists, and claimed over 500 deaths on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son was arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and former candidates for Vice President's office, was arrested on charges of bodily injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disability of reporting domestic violence and resistance to state violence, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a friend who wanted to communicate with the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and has been charged a security deposit of $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when he was asked after his plea, he answered with "Not guilty, certainly," according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three class A irregularities, which can be charged with up to one year imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B disorder, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the veteran’s court in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, disability to report a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans’ organizations after returning her son’s behaviour to post-traumatic stress disorder in Iraq as a result of his time.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been interrupted and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesis, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On the social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu, when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Attorney General calls for rare death penalty for suspects in New York terrorist attack
The New York Attorney's Office calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the terrorist attack in New York City, who cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has been no longer imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a rented pick-up of the Home Depot building market for a terrorist attack, during which he ran on a bicycle route along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the defendants must prove that Saipov killed the eight ofers "targeted" and committed "consciously" serious bodily injuries, as stated in the statement of intent for the claim for the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a Federal Court of Investigation Saipov filed an indictment in 22 points, covering eight charges of murder against the background of organized crime, which are normally used by state lawyers in cases of organized crime, as well as an accusation of the use of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for 'fundamental planning and intent', according to the prosecutors who described the way Saipov carried out the act as 'abominable, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added damage, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrouchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York no longer pursued the goal of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to a life imprisonment sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York in a federal offence was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who two years earlier was accused of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months after the attack of a lack of regret, according to court documents.
Before investigators, he said he felt good about what he did, says the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested the police to hang up the flag of ISIS in his hospital.
He declared himself innocent in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defensemen representing Saipov, stated that they were "of course disappointed" as a result of the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of a guilt in exchange for a life-long sentence of liberty without the possibility of dismissal, will only prolong the trauma suffered by all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the charge not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party Member calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize 'the power of the people' today during a protest at the Tories Conference.
The former Ukip party leader said that politicians "must feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "already out" if Farage were a Brexit minister.
The challenge that May faces in reconciling its deeply divided party has been exacerbated by the fact that members of your party who are for a stay in the EU participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems holding up his Chequers compromise plan despite attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Ally insisted that despite the counter-actions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the "chaos".
Bone explained at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that “Chequers are on the garbage.
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed a peer and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we would be out already,” he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: ‘I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers is one of the garbage.’
Stressing his opposition to the EU, he said: ‘We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.’
Bone rejected allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: ‘The idea that the British people changed their opinion and now they want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit advocate of Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told reporters: ‘I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and in our activists, who actually go through the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp message to May, she continued: ‘ Prime Minister will keep their jobs if they keep their promises. ’
Farage said in a speech that politicians need to feel ‘the pressure’, should they be in the process of cheating the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” said Farage.
‘ They’re trying to cheat Brexit, and that’s why we’re here today to tell them ‘that’s not how you get away’.
Before an enthusiastic crowd he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is just before betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
‘We mobilize the power of the people of this country, who helped us to win in the referendum and will never come to rest until we are not an independent, self - managing, proud United Kingdom. ’
At the same time Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists swinged banners of the Tories Against Brexit Group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched on weekends.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, are there for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” said Adonis.
‘This is a farce.
There is simply no such thing as Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to ‘exactly check’ the presidential candidature
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she would 'exactly examine the presidential candidature'.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an eminent critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race to re-election for the Senate against the Republican MPs in the Parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was vice-chairman of Trump's election campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the focus of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been held since Trump's official appearance in its 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format.
One of the people present asked her if you wanted to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to "go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top."
Arrest after death on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday in case of fatal shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the shots.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shooting injury on his head and died as a result of this injury," according to information from the sports media portal 247sports of police chief Murphy J. Paul explained the media on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the scene and possession of a weapon and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and arrested in East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting positions in the last season and could have an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after leaving his team the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time that Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes Stallorder would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas got a good start and it was almost as if he introduced Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton hit the traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight wheel-on-wheel maneuver, where the Ferrari pilot was reluctant to release the inside, at risk of having two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started off on one of the rear squares of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round on place seven.
He was then the fastest for most of the race because he held on to his tire to quickly finish and overtake Kimi Raikonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the 44th round of the box and did not manage to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri brought an excellent performance all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to leave me.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election campaign on Saturday, insisting on not passing on to the press the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which she accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's statement to the Senate's Justice Committee was not directly addressed, but commented that the Senate's actions show that people are "common, evil and dishonest."
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate over the last few days is when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and angry and dishonest," the President said.
"When you look at the leaks and say, "Oh, I wasn't.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Thinking of your answer... Did you post the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, give me a minute.
No, we didn't publish it," he added by imitated the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was quoted with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and was released in early September. However, Feinstein disagrees that the leak comes from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not publish your story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I answered her request for secrecy."
Your Dementi did not seem to arrive at the president who said on Saturday evening at the campaign event: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defence of the judge candidate, accused by three women of sexual assaults, the Democrats claimed to use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You can see the community, the evil, they don't worry who hurt them when they let them get under the wheels in order to gain power and control," the President said Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants through a 5-3 win in the playback in Dundee again on Saturday.
The Giants went on tour early with two goals, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard stood out for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured victory with two goals.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe who beat Dundee on Friday night 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening gate took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaul. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the presentation when Beauvillier expanded the tour.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into play after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt Cownie made it to its compensation gate after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the guide of the Giants before the half-time break when he reached his second gate of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard was again balanced with a power play result in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half. Nielsen then secured his team victory with a fifth goal after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home at the Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Air traffic controllers died after he was certain that hundreds of people would escape the earthquake on a plane
An airliner in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to safely launch an aircraft with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still to be felt in the region and many people are caught under debris in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the strongly fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the runway at the time, could safely lift off.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was falling.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirai, spokesman for the Indonesian Air Safety Service, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, says Australian ABC News.
“We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand, and the National Civil Protection Authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still under the debris, while others cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass grave on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech before the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to carry out all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Since you were ready?" CNN said.
Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes in Lombok this year, with over 550 people dying.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports of a missing after aircraft crash in Lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now reporting a missing person after first claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated in a notice that they cannot say anything about the stay of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline indicated working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members after the plane was plunged into the water when attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials reported that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline indicated that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital, but in a stable condition.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both declared that the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was flying out of the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying very flat.
"This is a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade through deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who worked nearby to improve a mooring site were rushing with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people died in the crash of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them were involved with Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the accused closed her evidence in the renegotiation of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her night of death using cell phone calls.
Rowlett said he had received position data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the period when he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police talked to Sanford.
Sanford came to the stand on Saturday and said that he had not been to the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's Pick-Up that night, Sandford said that he had lied, "because my Pick-Up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis indicated that Chambers knew about their death time for two weeks.
Mobile records, however, pointed out that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis lost their news, calls and contact information from his phone some time after Chamber's death.
"He took them out of his life," says Hale.
The defense is expected to begin its plea on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then proceed before the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that Hip Hop has removed itself from its roots from the political message and social commitment.
They want to make back to its roots and back to socially conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a renaissance in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York baby girl suing couple for being dismissed for "rassing" SMS
A New York baby girl sued a couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving a misguided message from the mother who complained that she was still "a black."
The couple disagreed to be racist and compared the litigation with a 'stress'.
The two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her distress when she found out that the new Mother of the Day, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEIN, NOCH EINE SCHWARZE", Plasco-Faxman wrote her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending them to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice.
After she recognized her Fauxpas, the "paintly touched" Plasco-Flaxman left Maurice and claimed that the open afro-American daymother had done bad work and she had instead expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation for the 350 dollars per day, which she should have spent over six months on the job for which she had originally been booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look at what they don't do," said the newspaper on Friday, "I know that discrimination is."
The couple rejected the accusations of racism and argued that the release was the reasonable step, as they feared Maurice, after they had insulted them, would no longer be able to trust them.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t want to say.
She's not a rassist.
We are not racists," explained husband Joel Plasco to the post office.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the litigation with an "extortion" and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and "in a difficult situation".
“You want to interest a person like that?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the litigation continues, the couple was quickly condemned in public and denounced on the social media, where they were criticised for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would not identify with a speaking bear, a new letter revealed
Karen Jankel, daughter of the author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said of the letter: “It is hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with his work being rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of his publication after his death last year was "biter sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddingtons, which she describes as "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and did not boast," Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child doing something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance," says Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart on the pump slowly sounded off and left her body.
She died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to tear myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned for the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers who did not get any of what she was going through, went aboard the plane.
"No one knew," she said.
I had my head lowered and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Suffering women hang up cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones through suicide try to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung on a bridge in Wales maps with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting points.
Davis son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day," she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, stated that her son had a promising career as a cook and he had a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten a room."
However, he announced his job before his death because he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after suicide by his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: "I always fear that this could have a consequence."
Davis designed the cards to “show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay quiet: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was together for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he felt depressed or depressed," she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was at the bottom. When the children unpacked their gifts, he did not see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that it had to go through: “It pulls a huge hole into the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the sweat while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked, i.e. a temporary and limited investigation, we could perhaps get some agreement," Flake said on Saturday. He feared that the committee would 'break apart' in the political stand-by.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Your objection can be traced back to the timing alone.
The interim elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut off badly as expected, then they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush seized the phone listener to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents his report?
There is a vote in the Senate in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to decide on equal votes and to confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overflowers “sink” under Kim
The number of North Korean cross-country skiers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, such a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, which uses data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that last year 1127 overruns were registered, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Park called for stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as the main factors.
Pyongjang did not express himself publicly.
The vast majority of crossings from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean war in 1953 more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China is more of an illegal immigrant than a refugee and often leads them back with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in the state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pyongjang to discuss the denucleation negotiations.
This was the result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, at which they agreed to work on a deducarized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused American sanctions of the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not fit for the Supreme Court office
The minority leader in Nancy Pelosi's House of Representatives called Judge Candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was characteristically inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who acted in such a way would have been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all the accusations that he abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both teenagers were.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost screamed and stood in tears just before breaking out when he talked about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him a "great and coordinated assassination" organized by Liberals, which was the election in 2016 to be angry with Hillary Clinton's lost presidency.
Pelosi said that she believes that Kavanaugh's statement proves that he could not serve the Supreme Court as she shows that he was biased towards democrats.
"I believe that he has declared himself unfit with these statements and the way in which he went about the Clintons and the Democrats," she explained.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh off the office, should he be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his current position of judge," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi further said that, as a democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion decision Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions as to whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now we don’t need a hysterical, prejudiced person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘Oh, that’s not wonderful’,” Pelosi said.
Women must use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere speech of hatred, months and years of overheating anger and she does not get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said she was crying when she gets angry but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she said: “You may think that I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then just keep talking.
I found this brilliant."
Tears are allowed as valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I wept because of an indescribable anger and was caught up in a stairwell by an elderly woman, an undercooled manager.
"Never let her see you cry," she told me.
“You don’t know you’re sore.
They believe that you are sad and will be content with yourself because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart on board a ship named Monkey Business was caught in an extramarital affair and subsequently withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidate himself.
"This was not a well thought out decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation: ‘Schneewittchen and the seven dwarfs.
Since the election campaign was already advanced, she was at the back of the fund-raising and she swore not to apply if she wasn't going to get two million dollars together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 supported her campaign with only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
In her speech, in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was thus so difficult from her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made it so difficult to obtain funds and direct address the voters instead of the delegates, as well as anger about sexism, so overwhelming that she was close to tears.
"One could have assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“It could have been believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember asking myself what they would probably write on my gravestone.
"She was crying?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China trade war
The opening halls of the trade war between the US and China were deafening. Although the battle is not over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a long-term pit between the countries, my expert.
Donald Trump, the American President, fired the first warning at the beginning of the year when he was serving important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with penalty tariffs.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new customs duties on goods worth 200 billion dollars, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China into the USA.
Beijing fell in the same way each time and recently raised fines from five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China vows to respond to any action taken by the US and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon collapse.
To move Washington to lead would mean to give up. However, a public cut to the US would be far too shameful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that, if Beijing plays out its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision could create the conditions for economic turmoil in both countries, either in Washington or Beijing, is actually much more dangerous than many observers have recognized before," says Abigail Grace, a scientist who focuses on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria be 'ready' for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the war for over seven years.
In an address before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that circumstances in the country improved.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government rebuilds the areas destroyed by terrorists to allow normality to return.
All conditions were now set for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomed aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe achieved a victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the USA.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with most of the tournament, sank his drop on the 16th track (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine all round and became one of the 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was 5-4 beat by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who possibly played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so infinitely happy to win back the cup.
It's about the team and I'm glad to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
On Sunday 2-1 he won the singles against the American golf legend Tiger Woods.
I am so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, which I have been following on television since my childhood," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The team USA had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have made high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of the guys they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We didn't do anything about it.
Take care of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players scored a good performance.
We'll regroup, I'll talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be her captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
