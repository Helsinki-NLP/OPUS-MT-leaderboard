Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth President
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to accept the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth President of the United States in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a cheque of over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the North-West metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he pays a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The presidential couple then planned a meeting with King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit then reaches its peak with the ceremony at which Obama takes the prestige prize.
He receives this as the fourth President of the United States, but only as the third President who receives the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will speak at the price of the Afghanistan War.
The President does not want to depart from this issue because he knows that he will accept the price as a President who is currently conducting war in two countries.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics can forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Golmedaille, the Diploma and the cheque over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to donate for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, where, apart from Norway's King and Queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant from the beginning to the price.
He pointed out, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that it is not just the price for him, but for everyone who strives for the same values as he does.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this is "invitation to act" for him.
Naturalists are accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz Police accused the chairman of the civil society association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of blackmail.
In several cases last year he filed appeals against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his appeals he called for money from investors in his favor, said Leitmeritz politician, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaftist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and he's under a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste container in Brno doesn't smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in southern Moravia, you can find the sorting waste container again on a step-by-step basis.
And in Brno?
A few minutes would have to be reserved to find the right garbage cans.
I don't want to claim that the waste separation in Brno wouldn't work at all.
But it seems to me that the Council is not sufficiently concerned with this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Br√ºnn is in the waste division in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting container, but above all by the amount of waste for such waste.
Have they tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collecting basket at some point in the center?
It's just art, it takes time and a lot of nerves.
The only place I have found by chance so far is the Moravia square opposite the affected goose.
Mr Unterka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but I think that is far too little.
Apart from the fact that waste separation is not honey licking in other parts.
A lot of my friends therefore prefer not to sort the waste at all.
From laziness.
It is too far for them to waste.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles myself after the celebration.
But on the Konicova street, I didn't see any color trash in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when I was on the tram.
But the garbage almost ran over.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably makes the Brno Socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us shamed throughout the Republic instead of buying a few garbage tons more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brown.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company ECO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has removed the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits and building savings.
But also not for government debt interest or for international litigation.
This causes even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists have enforced the increase in wages for some groups, they have calculated that the government will borrow the money for the sensitive expenditure, retirement pensions or for the sick pay. "This is just a delay of problems in the future, mine laying," says Janota.
Most of the loans are paid higher and higher interest rates, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose where to take from, the Treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs of state operations are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the left now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
People don't have to worry about the pensions, or the sick pay, whose account has disappeared from 1.8 billion dollars, they get that money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, the central bank will not only lack 163 billion, but much more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, debt will rise faster and faster and, together with it, costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will not be enough to increase VAT only slightly or to cut maternity pay as the government did in its area deficit package.
As a result of the cash flow in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing for the expansion of motorways and railways next year.
It is mainly the sections gained in competition that can no longer be reprojected and, if necessary, promoted.
Get what's not free either.
This means delay or closure of thirty major buildings, which is also at risk of European money creation, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the cash outflows in a salomon manner - it attacks the CEZ shares in which the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is then distributed to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion CEZ came into the budget.
Annually, the dividends will pay the environmental damage liquidations, fill up the pension account and this money will also serve as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 per cent of GDP in accordance with EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of the revolutions.
Almost three billion fell the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and of crimes or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
It is not certain whether the state can do without this money.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The minister must then save the money inside the house or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
A hundred million is also missing for the two billion-dollar "Staatskasse" project, which has already begun, which aims to monitor on-line, for what the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect to use a mobile phone for the future, on which the user can switch by pressing a single key between different operating systems.
The plans presented look promising.
Just press one button, and Windows Mobile will change Android within a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that the American company VMware wants to introduce, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We enable you to perform two user profiles simultaneously on your phone.
You can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti indicated by VMware during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented last November and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of the smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM storage, on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and is expected to be the customer's device within 2012.
Snowfall on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Snowless slopes not only cause worry to the giant mountain dwellers.
The missing snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but by now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether, in our opinion, this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mats", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
If you want to stay in the New Year's Eve mill exactly according to your ideas, you should no longer hesitate with the order.
If you prefer saving and the quality of your stay comes in second only, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelm√ºhle hotel owners now offer mainly only weekly stays for the New Year's Day.
I think they'll try to sell it for a while, but then they'll have to give up, and then they'll have to go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, esteemed Jandura.
Free beds on all winter dates always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led by the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi Travel Office can also offer the New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains, but there are less places available here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that in Giant Mountains there is always no snow.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed out within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, according to Schefert.
Conversely and slightly better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas, we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
At 80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays, Hotel Omnia is also occupied by Janske Lazne Central Park Square.
On the other hand, half of the beds are still available at the newest Janske Lazne hotel at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised by this year of January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A bit weaker is now the February, but at the moment when the snow comes, certainly the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains increases, led by the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Riesengebirge hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow-diving.
On Thursday it should be cooled and if rain comes, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that a warm-up is to come again, Jiri Jakubsky informed of the location of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeating is Mother of Wisdom
It's almost strange with which student ambition Barack Obama, the president with his call of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question he himself considered to be the dumbest.
Finally, when he sweated his longing expectant Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it down over the copy of the Busch-Irak scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Way Forward" without squeezing.
He himself, three years ago, criticised the Bush idea - sending fresh troops contingents into Iraq plagued by the civil war - as "irresponsibly and in the aftermath of a catastrophic decision".
However, the following months showed that the Bush strategy, based on recommendations from the military, was the only possible and, to the extent, very successful, that the news about Iraq is no longer at all spoken today.
Bush's reputation was not improved by this, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
In order to increase the contingent of troops, the military again asked him, especially the commander of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who even in spite of the habits of subordination, strongly criticized the stabbing shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation to the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but didn't come up with a better idea and so he betrayed the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has pressed the commitment for another 5,000, even though he himself originally counted at least 10,000.
The greatest problem with the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-up will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even despite the brother war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can rely on them and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if formally established, remain only fading, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complex, especially because of the lack of clarity of the conditions that further complicate Pakistan and Iran's influences.
The establishment of a "active state", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama‚Äôs strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further, and now it is on the edge of the explosion.
Thinking that the little soldiers who broke into the war cry about the "early return" create a miracle here can only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is simply irresponsible, because the Taliban will accept that as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to take part in the fighting in Afghanistan has been reduced.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters the way in which Germany's or Italy's security is linked to the war in the Hinduukush-Gebirge.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate and the increased sanctions not affect the Iranians, a very serious question for the United States is whether the problem should not be solved by troops.
This question has to be answered in the period in which America goes to Obama to win a victory from Afghanistan.
But every solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only source of comfort for Barack Obama is the fact that three more years remain until the presidential election, and thus there is enough time for him to reach a different strategy if it would prove to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive bonus bonuses in cash
The executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive a bonus bonus in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of money, but they are only allowed to sell in five years.
In addition, the shares may be removed from managers in the event of excessive risk.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to link Wall Street's premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, led by the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made himself the target of criticism, having set aside nearly $17 billion for bonus bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to the Reuters Agency, the total amount of bonus bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars despite the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest policy issue at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to tax the bonuses of the banks that exceed 25,000 pounds once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women won Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Today in Stockholm, five record women have taken over this year's Nobel Prizes from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf in the subject categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer, Herta M√ºller, was among them Romanian author.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her countryman Jack Szostak, for research in the chromosome field.
Israel's Ada Jonath has received the prize for chemistry along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, to inform the ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureate awarded the Nobel Prize for Economy, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only subject category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao have won this prize for research in the fiber optic sector and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax machines or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these winners received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate on the purchase of the money prize.
This amounts to ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the money price is divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his path, and he is also at the top of the country leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
On Friday morning, President Vaclav Klaus receives the finance minister, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his remaining in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form that was released by the assembly of Members on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president, Radim Ochvat, informed us about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, about his further retention in his position.
According to the Budget Act now signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic was to manage with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, Parliament voted on Wednesday on the left-wing proposals for conversion and increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has resisted the proposals of the Social Democracy that it cover up increase the budget deficit.
The left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party on the other, therefore a sharp domestic political dispute arose, which is why the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer Office cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures that were enforced by the fishermen's government in the autumn and that, in their understanding, it should end the state debt.
Klaus, who is able to sign the State Budget Act but does not have to, said today during the early discussions with entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem", which is the "untenable deficit" of public finances for a longer period of time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, stated that the budget is horrific, and the government should consider its continued existence.
The ODS Chair, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the civil service cabinet, supported by the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party, is obviously no longer working.
Premier Fischer described similar words in the editorial as "strong sayings".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to Topolanek's words that the state deficit is terrible, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSDD assessed the approval of the state budget as a success for next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie "Invictus: The Unbeatened" of the world shows much of the country, of whose struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story of American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood movie.
Another significant role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "When I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing section "Million Dollar Baby" was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which he ended up being a slave holder, a fictitious US president, and also God in "Evan Allmacht", but rarely anyone who lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeated", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was to talk like him
The film depicts a real event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, to reach an agreement on the country. The new President, Mandela, knows that even after apartheid, his people still remain racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can join his people through sport, so he decides to join the rugby players who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was of course to talk like him.
The actor said, if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat with him for dinner and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it's transferred, and I felt I know what you're feeling, he said.
For me, it's important to be another person.
Matt Damon is in the film Fran√ßois Pienaar, captain of the national rugbyteam, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise to him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I rang to the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to Fran√ßois Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeated" and is also spoken of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the daily variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was a very good story, a very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatotoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret over Norway dissolved: Russians have tested a rocket
About Norway a special light effect of unknown origin was observed.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only yesterday admitted that an intercontinental ballistic missile was being tested near the Norwegian border.
But the start was not successful again and the rocket called "Bulava", which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of Russian generality as well as of the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence at the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, you already write about "Bulava" as about a "raket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that does not fly but shines
This already 13th attempt, was normal at the beginning.
In turn, technical damage to the rocket occurred only at the end of the flight.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket stage.
"Bulava" started this time from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donsky, which drove under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch of the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indeterminate flying object over north roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, since the first moment the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian missile.
The generality has kept itself from this time and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without a fault, the Ministry of Defence's management considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success thus meets the generality with optimism and so is maintained that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even carry up to ten hypersound atom heads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself in a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow out in distress, and is probably already in the Friday round KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at age 40 in 1998, is currently President of CSKA.
After Denis Kulyas was injured, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, Agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergei Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only concern one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other fellow players, led by fellow player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice, he becomes the oldest professional Russian ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary stormer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford at the age of fifty and a half, and was able to score 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union Dress, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships and also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career he also won the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice over his head in the Detroit-Dress.
He has been a member of the ice hockey star room since 2001.
Hyundai gave up the trade unions. All overtime is cancelled
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the union to abolish all overtime.
Because of often arranged overtime, the union announced the strike readiness on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automotive factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our production plan, which is a principle, which is why, on Saturday 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working shifts would be worked, said Vanek.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company has offered a 400 CZK bonus to employees who would work on Saturdays.
The employees will also receive it in the afterlife for the Saturday shift of November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they pay the overtime allowance or they can take a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holiday, Vanek led.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday class are paid the fee and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overtime was the most urgent and burning point regarding the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the abolition of all overtime for the month of December, Vanƒõk added.
The employees of the automobile factory had been forced until last week to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift two more hours.
Following the signing of the agreement, the strike readiness is revoked by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unionists are due to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfilment of the demands and sign a common document, they would be prepared to cancel the strike.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automotive factory became more acute when about 400 employees spontaneously stretched out for constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management held, however, that the employees had to do the overtime to comply with the automotive supply requirements.
The trade unionists also called for no sanctions to be imposed on workers who had interrupted production last Wednesday during their Monday campaign.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions demand that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, this year they demand the payment of 5000 crowns.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The production of series was started in the company last November.
Up to this September, approximately 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, with the current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with stolen HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants is not as strong as one of the drugs already available.
AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, patients can prolong their life and prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus reproduction also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses against which medicines are no longer effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCT (Chemisch-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to how to deal with the virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metalocarborans have an effect on the protein that is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus proliferation in a different way than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists get to new ÃÅimproved ÃÅ compounds, which were prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two versatile cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Home-like and persistent virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus spread caused by the HIV protease, mature infectious virus particles would not occur.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed.
A bit weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances on the HIV protease was tested in the reagent glass, including their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants that the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, makes metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research on the development of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fighting for budget. ODS started on fishermen who resists
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "grey" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It's supposed to be time for the analysis.
Deputy ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the civil service cabinet, supported by the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party, is obviously no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely in Parliament on the minority when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he is left in office with the help of the left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problems of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, but with left-wing amendments of more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for government salaries, for maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has resisted the proposals of the Social Democracy that it covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic was supposed to be operating with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has complied with the government's wish, because the amended budget is also only a less bad variant of the budget forecast.
Disappointment and senselessness
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, spoke of his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened with his resignation in the event that the amendments would be accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television Janota has registered with the Premier for Monday after the government business.
In so doing, he indicated that he was considering his remaining in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the budget's use.
According to Necas, the Social Democracy Nominants (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, did not do anything in the government.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those concerning sickness pay and pensions or the new service law.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ODS nominated ministers did not make any mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the USA.
It has been mentioned that in some ministries there are alternates who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen decide to refrain from the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it should be based on the majority of the left that is currently in Parliament."
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I did not think about it, and if that is going to happen, then I will deal with it, said the defence minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens' democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon to attend the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Premier
At the same time Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister expressly asked the MPs of the Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We are not orphans, we are not small children, so he replied to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party president in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was going to be missing.
As soon as I gave up the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevikization of Parliament and destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railways) less trains will drive for about the same fare.
The Czech railway is terminated or restricted by 13 December, while some of the less-laden fast and local trains are being strengthened.
From the date of validity of the new timetable, the total transport volume will be reduced by two per cent compared to today.
Most tariffs, including basic and customer driving tariffs, are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area receive several connections to the capital, and the railway uses Pendolino-type trains for this route.
The express train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less trains will also travel on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (K√∂nigsgraz), with a total of eight per cent, while an increase can be expected in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route are also lifted and for a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
Among the major changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to change.
It is the 15th road of the Esko sub-urban transport system, the opening of which is possible thanks to rail electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distance to the capital will end in the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more connection lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will drive at a time of two hours.
With the Pendolino the passengers have not been able to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's regional rail bill: 200 million increase
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, in total the railways will receive four billion crowns in the next year to compensate for the so-called loss of liquidity as well as this year. The local trains supply the districts, in total they will pay eight billion crowns in the next year, with the state firing three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the fast trains, the railway has re-negotiated a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps because of this, they have not taken up the price increase in the vast majority of tickets.
Changes can only be made for one day's CD Net and for cheap eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The eLiska price will then depend on the driving plug, until now it was uniform for the trip between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
The Philippines Millitantes arrest more than 50 people and the children have been released.
Millitante kidnapped 75 people today in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary schoolchildren and their teachers.
This is what the AFP said, which originally only informed 65 kidnappers.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millitants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now working on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP, the Millitants are members of the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence which demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the law was imposed on 57 persons because of the recent massacre.
Among the victims of the massacre on 23 November, which coincided with the election to the governor's office, 30 journalists were.
On suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippines province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But on Tuesday the peace talks with the Phillippin government resumed.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will be released in the American cinema "Invictus: The Unbeatened", part of the life story of Nelsona Mandela, former President of the Republic of South Africa.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The side actor role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been played by Matt Damon.
With the cinema launch of the film, the reactions of critics as well as the public are also loud.
Nelson Mandela
His whole name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it comes to cinemas at a time when, on the one hand, preparations for the World Cup are culminating in South Africa, but, at the same time, the media are shaking the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are always positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about playing the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless proud of his own words on the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
On several occasions, I personally met Nelson Mandela, so that - as one says - I can receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing that this movie can be used to tell the personality of Mandelas and his message.
This is a story of South Africa, but it concerns every human being, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book template of British writer John Carlin, freely translated ÃÅIn the role of the enemy ÃÅ: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African human rights defender within his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, in the course of the film, tries to bring together two racial and, year after day, distinct populations, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also in his role in the South African National Rugbydress on the world Cup field, which was won by South Africa at that time.
For entering the lawn in a dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations 14 years ago, mostly from the white audience and thus gained recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may be able to bring people back to a single people, led by rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves will show up first.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as, for example, in a recent interview with LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switching plant at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the Usti nad Labem district fire department, Lukas Marvan, six units entered the fire.
Originally, the fire department wanted the transformers to burn out, but later it changed its view and now the fire with a mixture of water foam and special extinguishers is removed.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the Haverie did not endanger the management system's security operations, according to the company spokesman Pavla Mandateova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will be counted only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to the mandateova.
For more than 10 years CEPS has done nothing similar, mistakes of this kind are rare, added to it.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokesman of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, because the fire of the Trafostation did not affect the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is a sole operator of the control system, 400 kV and 220 kV electrical lines in the Czech territory.
It maintains, renovated and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy in distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometers is transferred.
Jancura raises criminal charges for slandering three head of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal charges for slandering three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio newspaper.
The action is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders are attacking us and saying that we are taking out the raisins, we have only submitted the offer on the extent to which it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railways because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that were completed last week.
There is nothing left to us but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he had evidence from all the districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are making a complaint to the European Commission.
Hasek considers the criminal prosecution to be a continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his society as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call for further leaders.
I assume that this issue will also make it clear that it is Jancura who, in the case of regional rail transport, manipulates the public and uses false and untrue arguments, said Hasek.
Last week, Jancura reported that he had invested several million crowns in advertising that will point to the adverse step of the districts.
He told the radio newspaper that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and continue it after New Year.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign initiated Jancura after the districts had agreed to operate the regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and had not tendered for the contract in a high price of SEK 150 billion.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, he was also threatened by criticism of rail traffic in the districts by a member of the CSDD.
The only threat was if we did not give up that we could then lose the bus licenses as well.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, Jancura told the radio newspaper today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease free of charge and on a voluntary basis
Immunization against pneumococcal disease changes the habit from January onwards.
It should be the first to be free of charge and voluntary for families.
But already now, voices are saying that the mandatory reception would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal disease are culminating.
The medicine already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that the health insurance has to pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January onwards, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals born on August 2, last year and later.
The condition is that they have not received a vaccination dose yet.
Anyone who has started vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for further revaccination himself.
The first dose of the vaccine must be given between the 3rd and 5th months of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurances spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year for the vaccine doses.
But they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children's surface vaccinations.
The mandatory acceptance was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
Through pneumococcal infections, up to 28 children up to 10 years of age die from examinations in hospitals every year.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory reception of children against pneumococcal disease was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, these are to be paid and voluntary by the insurance companies.
For example, the head of Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the mandatory reception would be better.
Its association has long been promoting pneumococcal vaccination.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to achieve at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not intend to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal disease.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen said.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, chairman of the specialist company of practical paediatrics, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all the children were vaccinated, one could think about the reduction in the number of repeat vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a volunteer," however, Cabrnochova says.
Professionals expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcals from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcal disease is also groundbreaking in that it is paid by the health insurance as the first area vaccination and not by the state.
Insurance should spend the money on prevention to save them for further treatment, says Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, is a concern of the practical paediatrics that concerns the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial project, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors should receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the State.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance companies could "execute the money from the health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them for them.
It is estimated that the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy at all, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist son involved in "Museums theft"
The son of famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal 20 million dollar paintings from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught with a trailer when 90 paintings were loaded into his vehicle.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used a excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan der Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the Associated Press, the artist stayed in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family gang.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father, "that he should enter the museum by all means to bring all paintings into a warehouse".
The Agency announced that Frank Frazetta is a senior citizen who has granted a permit.
Labour defends state and tax increases
Ministers defended the tax increases and expenditure cuts announced in the Pre-Trial Report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had given a "missing" opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Treasury was also shot at targeting low- and medium-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% capping limit on public wage statements for 2011.
Social security worries
The trade unions, on the other hand, protested that low wage earners were punished for a recession that they did not cause and warned of "problems" ahead.
The increase in social security - to about GBP 3 billion a year - has upset the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on the economic upturn.
The increase limited to those who earn more than ¬£20,000 a year will affect about 10 million workers.
MODIFICATION OF THE PRE-FILLED REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5 % from April 2011
This year, the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on bankers bonus
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small enterprises rejected
Tax bases for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates from the Treasury, someone with an annual income of ¬£30,000 will be poorer by ¬£90 per year and someone with ¬£40,000 per year will be poorer by ¬£190, while a person with ¬£10,000 will be richer by ¬£110.
Ministers said that their deficit reduction target by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be deducted from the 5% of top earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms disagrees that the tax increases and expenditure stoppages outlined would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is also absolutely necessary over the period over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth ‚Äì which influence the size of the new debt and the speed of the deficit withdrawal ‚Äì were questioned after the treasurer was forced to revise earlier figures.
In his opinion, the economy is likely to fall by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% reduction predicted in April - while debt would be ¬£3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Forgive opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against the "school crisis" of Labour, said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that the ministers failed to present a credible plan for paying back this and "cynic" for difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything about what they were going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are kept before future cuts, unlike the Conservatives' proposals, which see the deficit closure coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by the tax increases and spending stops is used to cover the spending for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The BBC political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment for some invalidity pensions next April - the Treasurer would suspend the rejection of the vote, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra assistance if people need it most and that the situation is reviewed in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although ministers have not announced any state details beyond 2011, economists say that pressure on public spending will only come to fruition in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Investigations said that the treasurer's figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to the business audit firm Deloitte.
"This was only the hollow pre-state report. The markets recognize that."
FBI investigates "Fortresses of U.S. citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panjab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan reported to the BBC.
The FBI said it was being investigated whether these were the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them shall be of Pakistani descent, one of which is Egyptian origin, and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges they are accused of and under which circumstances they are detained," said Spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokesman Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to identify their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had already been interested in the house before and that no charges against the arrested men have yet been filed.
The Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the United States "must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty Sentenced "Miss" in Iran
According to a report by Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details the regime's "misuse patterns" both before and after the presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens of prisoners and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC-Teheran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak strike agency.
But since then there has been no tolerance by the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"Falish Confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was still bleeding and half unconsciously released on the street, Amnesty reported.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also referred to the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained with 75 more than eight weeks in a container in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the government's response to it, but that Amnesty, the mandates and power of these institutions would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park Skihang was set up
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a racetrack.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
At the top of the hangover in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump channel at the beginning of a 100 meter long hangover.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the hangover, but it was also very frightening.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that glitter below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best pieces of art on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening the snow is left to melt.

Can Islam Be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a ban on the construction of minarette and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most secularised societies in Europe ‚Äî and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French do not love headcloths" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and narrowly argued study of a dispute that the country shared over a decade and occupied and whose effects are still visible today.
Bowen's latest book offers a more comprehensive and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he would not only like to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic free spaces".
He is a good listener, he gives up debates between teachers and students on the issues they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a sense-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, which make up daily life, quite contrary to the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arabic-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who interviewed Bowen are usually dissatisfied with their salafi acts ‚Äì advocates of Purist Sunni Islam, which is connected with Saudi Arabia ‚Äì which nowadays show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowing believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guarded the separation of the Church and the State) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsh treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, in turn, had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes rather a "shattering of the value screws" than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you are inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most consoling view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice, which marks it, melts at alarming speed and takes life with it, which cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have recently entered the open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") draws a natural story of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
In the complex history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proven themselves in hunting polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old flagman to the lake, who only fought with the rifle of his Muskete, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears during a performance.
Even today, zoos typically still have a millionths of the habitat of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became quite green by the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, landing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters use powerful storm rifles in helicopters and snowmobile-driving Inuit to track their prey.
Ironically, the ice in the waters north of these two hunting nations will remain the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of Arctic science and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
But this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries made the first indication of the confusion of the pack ice.
Undersea boats in the Cold War the shifting ridge during undersea.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale application of measuring probes to icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people camping out in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater rinks that are pressed together during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... it could be us"
Marine infantry were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington Kr√§nze
The commander-in-chief De'Angello Robinson traveled on the bus seven hours to put a single crane on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marine infantrymen who took the trip of Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they stepped.
In a few months, wherever we're brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington-Friedhof.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip each year, stop in different cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which also extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreathes on the graves at the Arlington Cemetery, in areas on the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the United Airline Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transportation of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to the victims.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Packed in layers of warm clothes, the volunteers walked across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World Wars and the Vietnam Wars as their goal, as they were not visited as often as the newer graves, said the organizers.
The mood was happy, children played and couples stood by the hand while they carried the fresh pine branches to the gray gravestones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate this section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Some weeped openly, others prayed and families and friends stuck to each other in the icy air.
Some read loudly the names chiseled in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white space cards that had been put in the wet mud for those whose gravestones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyard of Marine Infrared Officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in July in battle.
No one should ever forget why we are free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been around for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested a contractor from the U.S. government, who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said Foreign Minister's representatives on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US International Development Authority and the World Bank.
Consular officials from the U.S. representative in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The special charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of "fearing".
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Governmental graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by popular reporter Yoani S√°nchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
S√°nchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the communist government of the Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy highlights the fact that the United States will provide compensation when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought after products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed normal citizens to buy a mobile phone this year, they are used to send text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government departments, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba sit behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesman for the U.S. interest delegation in Havana.
Berbena said she wouldn't be able to give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the provision of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, Same Cuba", an allusion to the establishment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country that replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, sentenced and detained within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries were moving towards a greater willingness to engage in dialogue.
Pakistani government officials cover plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hoped that this case could help to reveal an extensive network of terrorist applicants seeking out the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said that they had been looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saivellah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them on the YouTube video page had made acceptable comments on terrorist attacks.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saivelah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to submerge the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to seek the right recommendations to gain access to the Al-Kaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement agencies.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the decisive role of the competitors in identifying future terrorists and, perhaps, even more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence service has made it a matter of urgency to house human assets within Al Kaida.
The entrepreneurs of the organization act as guardians who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and such as could be the spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to a special test by A Kaida, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the top analyst of the NEFA foundation based in the US, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to whom they allow access, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
When one tries to catch someone in these groups, what better way could one go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday and called on the negotiators in the Bella Congress Centre of the city to take more effective action on climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more like 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the city centre.
One day, when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists migrated through the city with transparency, where "There is no planet B" in English, and one in Spanish, which said "The Earth says enough".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the journeys to Peru, the country of her mother's birth, made her aware of what heartbreaking problems the country has to face due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - in order to pass on the word and appeal to the world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there's no way around anymore.
The police stopped the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or brought pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in the event of demonstrations.
According to a viewer who did not want to be mentioned because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing lit several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, where several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they began as light missiles, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the congress center, people gathered in front of TV screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the awareness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of at all."
He then went to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and different sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent racial air
The evidences of mathematical achievement were good news for public schools in Washington D. C last week.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the country's schools that produce excellence, the evidence shows that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NEEP) is the persistent gap in performance between African and white pupils, both locally and nationally.
The average number of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but their afro-American peers only increased by three points from 209 to 212.
The power gap actually increased from 53 points in 2007 to 58 points in 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eight-graders basically remained the same, falling around a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap between the white and black fourth classes in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of children of both groups has grown over this period of time, the difference with now is hardly reduced by 58 points.
Some of the district's education advocates expressed their concern last week that the results celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, most of them white students, who are already powerful children, were promoted.
This suggests that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, Executive Board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that stands for equality of education in Washington D.C.
I do not jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said the democratic Washington City Councilman, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test points is that the secondary schools in the city urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What scares me, however, is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy that we need to use for our secondary school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the low-performance students.
This fall, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, which targets pupils in primary and secondary school upper classes, which have not mastered the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their same age classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses from kindergarten to sixth grade games and life-shrinking experiences, was taken to Washington under former school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum is attributed some of the NEEP's progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to ensure that the best measures are available to students below the grade level, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide additional money and resources to the weak schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, who examined urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to target its resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could have a political impact on this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that they try to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in Washington, in order to compete with charter schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the strength to change, said Janey, who with his teachers' union last year came to an agreement over 185 days per year, which he regards as "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than the future
The coach reaches the Gettysburg-College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and flashes a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents hardly finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was secured in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight students of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where the tuition costs 38.690 dollars per year, was rather the awe-inspiring visitor, than the enthusiast student of the future.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she thought, when she was told the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have taken the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Macedonia who do not stop high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive college education that is necessary to get into the middle class.
In fact, one of the five "second generation" of Hispano-Americans closes the college ‚Äì which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the labour force of the country.
Those who investigate powerful children say that these often have a natural affinity for school and a drive in them to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counselling programs also play a major role in helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to college, especially if these efforts continue for a longer period of time.
Looking at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia G√°ndara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, who examined hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from pre-school to high school.
The federal program, funded by Gracielas College Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - upstreaming - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue until they have completed high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% went to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to re-establish its damaged infrastructure at two auctions concluded on Saturday by major oil companies.
The 10 contracts signed with foreign oil companies from the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has drawn the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multits at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of US companies, Asian and European are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and the political instability caused by the withdrawal of the US military probably prevented American oil companies, according to analysts, from engaging more strongly in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
In some cases, U.S. companies were disadvantaged because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and rather take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that were able to conclude contracts with the ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been assisting with technical advice in recent years, have left empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The state China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the oil minister's spokesman, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to becoming one of the greats of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to measure itself with its supporters and fulfil its obligations towards Iraq.
For the bid fee, pre-selected companies issued bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top deployment planner of Al Kaida was killed this week, reports US terrorist attacks on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior terrorist organisation leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities, were supposed to have been killed by a number of rockets meeting their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's illegal tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said an official from a Pakistani civilian secret service from Miran Shah by telephone.
Local residents suspected of belonging to the militia ran to the site and quickly took all that was left of the "fully destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism led to vague evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as a leading military planner of Al Kaida, who led terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate character of U.S. air attacks on Pakistani soil.
If one accepts its central role as given, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and turned them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somalia had quickly ascended in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and maintained best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this does not in any way reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader killed since September when a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
The pace of attacks by drones in the CIA has declined since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups who have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while at the same time brutally killing suspected informants, reported the site.
Leading UN Messenger in Kabul will resign
The UN leader in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would withdraw from his office in March, ending a stormy term of office that was clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-supported Afghan presidential election.
Eide's departure takes place when the Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations Messenger said that he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concerns that the US timetable for military withdrawal, which should begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers to assist in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not establish his office, but only fulfilled an agreement with his family in March 2008 to remain in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UN-
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding him so that he has time to provide for a replacement.
What I said is that he'd better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the exit of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has started looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian staff of Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Gu√©henno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide rejected all allegations, but he also said that Galbraith's accusations - which was fired - "had undoubtedly caused damage to the mission, because a great deal of scepticism had already existed in relation to the international interference in the election".
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the American-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also called for the UN leadership to allow its successor to recruit more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who are donating for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the comprehensive UN adjustment regimes have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "important additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there is no good choice, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lies on my soul is if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, which is unforeseeable to the war."
The Obama government is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions might also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to "convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer terrible" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined the top European politicians in warning that Iran must face "credible" consequences if it does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that nuclear knowledge should only be acquired for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume discussions on limiting its nuclear programme and would refrain from a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has urged this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left negotiations on the provisional agreements since that date -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community alone in relation to some of the proposals they had already agreed to at the beginning of October has, frankly, brought together the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way that they had never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31st Dec. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before following other options, including those called by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once "expressive sanctions".
In an opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian delegation to the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "unsubstantiated and unfounded allegations" of some Security Council members on Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are prepared to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in the U.S. plans, to reduce the American troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to disperse Kurdish concern about the upcoming troop withdrawal. US representative quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, "We will maintain your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change in prices in the older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons have taught them so well that when government officials in Shanghai, which suddenly began to change the course this summer due to the low birth rate and the ageing population, encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, bereaved single children, who are lovingly called "small emperors", a population crisis is rising in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time of the entry into force of this policy, the UN
The Department of Population Affairs was established, while the number of the population aged 60 and over in 2020 is expected to rise explosively from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1% by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and seniors accounted for almost 22 percent of the reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age must be given "to help reduce the proportion of older people and alleviate the labour shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
China's one-child policy, anchored in the country's constitution in 1978, is likely to be the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy have to face huge fines - up to three times their annual salary in some regions - and discrimination at work.
Chinese government officials have ascribed to this policy that the critical use of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women who had already had a child to drive away.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude to the one-child policy.
In 2004 they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many harsh slogans was eased.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with a partner child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters who taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who will be questioned for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The municipal administration has sent municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and move information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice to those who had more than one child.
The reaction was not very encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Dissatisfied reaction
Although officials from a rural small town outside Shanghai said that an upswing in requests from couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts do not report any change.
For the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, the example is still only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the expected number of births in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Family Planning Committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want children anymore.
They want to give her the best of the first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this is also legally permitted.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudged the one-child policy as a human rights issue," said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are deprived of the possibility of having more than one child.
The problem, however, is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the staff manager, said she only wants one child because she was also a single child. "We were the centre of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want this either."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unceasingly.
For parents from the middle class with a double career through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it turns to be successful and for that one must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of Chinese capitalism experiment and they don't want to have a life like that for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, places enormous demands on the parents' time.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the room question -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you have to have a CV for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group drafts emissions reduction plan
The UN-funded climate conference, which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations, once again placed a focus on the publication of a document on Friday, which will record an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the next 40 years, with the industry nations in the near future having to shoulder the greatest burden.
The text, which could provide the basis for a definitive political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that runs out of time, as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a UN working group specifically for this purpose, is different from the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries, so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit value of the global temperature increase that policy makers would support.
The process is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, called the "big deal".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent in the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also gave the talks on Friday a boost through its commitment to provide USD 3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that had decided on the talks last week.
US climate commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding greenhouse gas emission reductions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if they are not financed by the industrialised nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China, as representatives of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging countries coming up and taking action, so Starm, who also complained that the text was not going far enough, to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion one hour after the statement of the Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs He Yafei, saying that it was either lacking in "reason" to the leading American climate negotiator or it was "very irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not financially help to master global warming.
With the future economic march of the great world powers at stake, both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging countries have opened up break-lines.
The current struggle is about saving individual economies and saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for those who should bear the cost of braking greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved on more aggressively to take account of their actions in countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic dominance, says Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will at best lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members presented a draft contract on the 24th of Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states is "political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions had to be clarified before the heads of government arrived in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, took off their aircraft and ran through the Bella Center's corridors to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to put down claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people enter the congress center every day, guitar-playing activists organize night shows in which they make fun of the countries that they think betray themselves and sell themselves, and draft contracts are passed on by hand instead of by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday will be 60 Heads of Government in Copenhagen.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President of Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
UK's first 225 km/h faster train redefines the feeling of Monday
Monday morning at 5 p.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train descent that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed shuttle train in the country will travel from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras 225 km/h and travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will then depart from London on board the first Javelin shuttle service.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and link the large urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and switching aircraft and cars to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage, could still pull the brake on British high-speed rails.
According to the Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will submit the report on 30 December.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will pass through urban areas and locations where the impact on the environment is controversial, with a range of five metres.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within 25 meters of the final distance.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger high-speed rail network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would be divided in or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Peninsulas to Manchester and Scotland and another towards the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railway insider.
After completion, travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today's slightly over an hour.
The drafts would offer trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first track was planned so that trains of 400 metres length with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains could operate on the London-Birmingham route per hour.
This would, in turn, mean that a terminal station would be needed in London, on which 20,000 passengers per hour could be made.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing train station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it is moving the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed routes to existing rail routes in northern Birmingham, which would keep the journey between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial point for ensuring a change from aircraft to rail, a guide for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers are paid for mortgages for 75,000 pounds orangerie of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading under-house member of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery that he could build in his home in his constituency.
The prison spokesman of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained that underhouse members had to live "of lean rations", has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to build an oak timber factory at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional amount of interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The Lower House officials approved the applications at the time, and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the lower house members' expenses. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not have been even cleaner or more understandable.
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expense control unit of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbours described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Even during a recent examination of its previous mortgage contracts, Duncan was not invited by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to comment on the increase in money collection.
Last month, after an examination of its expenditure, the Committee released it from the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over 271.406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency house, which he had purchased in 1991, one year before his election to the Member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show that Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) of a monthly mortgage refund by March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
Duncan's RBS-Hypothek interest rate has not changed during this time, suggesting that the total increase was used to finance the withdrawal of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that members of parliament would live "from lean rations".
"Essentially, when you work for the state, you have to live from lean rations and be treated like S*****e."
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden, and I claim a small part of it, as it were.
And I could have asked for the whole damn sum, but I'm not doing it."
The MEP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his expenses, when it became clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he had declared with the Fair Office that this "may be considered an exaggerated claim".
An activist dug a hole in Duncan's lawn as a protest in the form of a pound mark after it became known that he had requested 4,000 pounds (EUR 4,500) over three years.
When asked about the elevated mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This was both approved by the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg to increase the value."
He added: "There is no debate about evading or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer at all."
Come to all her believers to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found new life content as an interactive Advent calendar for the winter months.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free sparkling wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dried fruit pastries.
So far selected Christmas songs are "I know three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first No√´l", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is a volunteer priest of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we expect people to come to a strange old building as a church? I think the church should go to the people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturday and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate change, where the police have taken several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which was supposed to lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate contributes to the demonstration that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place a short time after the train passed when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had broken window with plasterstones and hammers, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-rescue officers have intervened immediately and without regard.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their estimate mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, were arrested in the East of France, in April, by these extremely violent factions, who have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, strongly criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant followers had been arrested "without distinction", and stressed that about one hundred of you "always were held in the streets on Saturday evening" despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in position.
The rather peaceful move has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters have travelled with busts and trains from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans, were also present.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue raincoats, have made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, because you have followed the call of friends of the earth to form "blue tides" for the "climajustice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a reparation of the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, just as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of critics of globalisation has approached environmental organizations.
European MEP Jos√© Bov√©, the shape of the critics of globalisation, announced that he had come to Copenhagen to link "Climate and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific area, where many islands are located, which are particularly at risk as a result of warming, has given the starting point for the demonstrations.
According to Australian organizers, some 50,000 people have gone to the streets.
In Manila there were a few hundreds of people, mostly students, who are marched in red and have been raising Bandanas, in which you have famous solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches of a few hundred protesters took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have brought together a few hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseilles (South), in Lille (North), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that it is dealing with a "string".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian Separatist Georgian territory as an independent region, Tbilisi denounced the "string".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian War for control over the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory recognised by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The voter turnout was approximately 58% a few hours before the voter turnout, according to the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first premature results should be announced on the night of Saturday on Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous President, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian-safe total occupation, explained his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After it had separated from Georgia during the 1992 - 1993 conflict, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia would like to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch, has explained.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen on the side of the Russian president and head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area with a population of 216,000.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the elections.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to the support of Moscow, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazian independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, answered Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition on its part, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia left Russia control over the railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated throughout the world on Saturday in order to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Kaufhagen Climate Conference, where the police, ready to use at any time, has arrested about 700 people on the margins of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon reasons in the Danish capital, which by 18 December receives delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was set up to welcome the planned speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of protesters dressed in black and armed with brick and hammers began to hit slices, a journalist from the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest police have surrounded you immediately and intervened without regard by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of "the Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent factions, which have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the East of France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury from a plasterstone during the incidents, in which, according to the police, about twenty persons were temporarily arrested, on the chin. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We're in control of the extreme groups," said the police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces were floating in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who travelled by rail or by private car from German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the Friends of the Earth to form a first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are going to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," explained activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can no longer say we still have time," says singer Ang√©lique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that sink, there are rivers through which you can run, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of opponents of globalisation has approached environmental organizations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and the critics of globalisation, Jos√© Bov√©, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice with social justice." "There is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific area, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people went to the streets.
In Manila, a few hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed red with Bandanas, made claims for solar energy before the city administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people gathered during the demonstrations organized by the "Net of 350", especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge from the school reform of the Lyc√©es.
The national education minister, Luc Chatel, explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du Sonntag", that the subjects geography and history are strengthened by the reform of the Lyc√©an school, even if they are not taught in the terminal (12th school year).
"The pupils of the Premi√®re (11th year of school) now have every four hours and the same program," confirmed Mr. Chatel.
For the minister "must be overcome this hypocrisy", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration "the best student."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one," he continued. He stressed: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been indignant by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals at technical lycens."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanit√© found that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticize the government project of removing compulsory education in history and geography in the terminals S (12th school year with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained about this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
On the other hand, the Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the Terminals S.
Luc Chatel also defended educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest against the project, which in their opinion is a victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that at the beginning of the year they will undergo a professional qualification examination in Master 2 (M2) and at the end of the year they will undergo an approval examination in which their teaching skills will be assessed.
They also carry out internships during the year in the M2 and then teach them one year before the students as a teacher in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you will achieve more hours you spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He once again confirmed that he wanted to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the commitment to the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As one AFP journalist noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts turn to the audience each fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach people and to make them feel like they want to learn more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organisers of this day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to fish in the school bass.
"Among the experts, around twenty participants were selected, even after their charisma," he explains.
"You can talk about global warming for hours, but the core targets can also be set out in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel to the AFP, who only spoke with the help of films before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audience might see that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online on the school page from December 15th.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of law enforcement officials called for a general day of action on Friday in order to achieve that the premiums and overtime payments, which were deferred for budgetary reasons until January, will be carried forward to the Christmas holidays.
The second union of law enforcement officials ("FO-P√©nitentiaire"), called on employees who have no duty to demonstrate and block them in front of the prison on Tuesday morning in order to draw attention to the "theft of what belongs to them".
The third CGT penitentiary called for "unifying a strong mobilisation in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of overtime, night allowances, and Sunday and holiday allowances in December were marketed as "damaging and unacceptable".
The first union of law enforcement officials, the autonomous federal penal justice union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to demonstrate dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the law enforcement agency and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime increased strongly in 2009 and not all were budgeted. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As reported by the Ministry of Justice in the evening, Mich√®le Alliot-Marie has sent a letter to the law enforcement trade unions guaranteeing payment in the next month.
"I am very well aware of the efforts made by staff to maintain and modernise our criminal justice system," the Justice Ministers said in this letter.
"I have asked the law enforcement agency to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, which has arisen from a lack of assessment of overtime, does not repeat itself in the future," Ms Alliot-Marie added.
Thus, the December salary is lean, except for management staff who benefit from high service and target bonuses, the UFAP/UNSA explains for whom the "household constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the inter-regional FO trade union in Marseille indignants and announces to boycott "all assemblies and vocations" up to new instructions.
"The staff do not go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime hours", threatens the FO Rh√¥ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being carried out without more staff being recruited, the attempt to enrich the staff's funds is more than inappropriate," said the Bordeaux CGT union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, as stated by the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-Fran√ßois Forget.
Obama is of the opinion that he always gives Christmas better gifts than he himself gets.
The American President, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has chatted with TV-talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he will always distribute better gifts than he himself gets.
At a special broadcast on Sunday evening on the ABC channel, the President and his wife, Michelle, gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo", says Michelle Obama, adding that the dog will of course also get a gift.
Michelle Obama strongly rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she necks the president.
"Please," he told her she was a bald man, pointing to the First Lady's beaded chain: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a relaxed atmosphere with the well-known television presenter Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the President and his wife also talked about gifts that they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten courses and also a basketball that his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought to him at Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us on Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the President.
"It was only a long time later in my life that I understood that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know at all how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put it all on the wall instead of grouping it around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," Michelle Obama told.
Johnny Hallyday again operated on, RTL confirmed that he had been transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles for significant "damages" after an operation in France. According to the surrounding persons, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was transferred to the artificial coma in order to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was once again operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sina√Ø Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors found "damages following the operation of a disc incident" which he had suffered in Paris on November 26th, his production company in Paris added that these damage had required a new operation.
The singer's production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available no later than 48 hours.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was turned into an artificial coma in order to avoid "difficulties and complications".
However, it was only after 48 hours that a little more certainty was given to the patient‚Äôs condition than he opened his eyes that RTL added.
At the request of the AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "there are certain sources" that after its first operation in Paris no "drainage" was laid.
The Rocker had been operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic due to a disc incident.
The surgery planned for several days was performed by neurosurgeon St√©phane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday evening.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was delivered to the Cedars-Sina√Ø Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the operation.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, thought to RTL on Thursday that his friend is going through a "deep valley". However, he assured himself that "no worries" were needed to make the rock musician, because he is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was bullshit to get on a plane for twelve hours after such an operation," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that "the infection is controlled".
Mr Camus also stated that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he had no particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer's health had become ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he had fallen on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer surgery", which resulted in a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as farewell tour, as planned.
Since then, however, every health problem has been widely commented on. Fans and journalists have not escaped the fact that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
Only in the middle of November did the people surrounding him have to deny another entry into the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over his favorite distance
The Frenchman Fr√©d√©rick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 swimming world championships, won an international title on Thursday over his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short-distance in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records while expecting a true record flood.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m locations of the gentlemen.
Damage to Bousquet, who wanted to take the 50m freestyle after the world record, whose record he holds in the big basin (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m-freesil, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually it is eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet invaded the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater things and in this case I have said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits that are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epoch in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
This time the combination has not paid off for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I could not achieve a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Zola grave plate estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman grave plate, which appeared only with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the third century after Christ and has always been rated with 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionysus are portrayed in a sophistical architectural decor surrounded by satyrs and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice President for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what the buyers have so far ordered most," says Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home for almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress C√©cile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom of her Parisian hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the IIIrd French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal P√©tain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the database of the Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola" which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Th√©r√®se Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's trip from Honduras to Mexico has been distorted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the fallen Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as not compatible after this conduct by the Putsch government had rejected as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya at night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of implementing this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the Immigration Authority, the plane issued by the Mexican Government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelayas, had returned to its place of departure.
The Putsch government wanted to ask M. Zelaya for "abdense" and for him abroad for political asylum under direction.
However, the fallen President refused to do so, wishing to return to Mexico as a welcome and eminent head of state.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a further failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," said Mr. Zelaya to Radio Globo, who has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here well and like to stay ten years, here I have my guitar, added the fallen President, who two and a half months ago fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa, under attack of some accords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the Putsch government, had declared against the Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not looking for asylum at all in any country, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, would only act as president of the Honduran people.
The rumors of Mr. Zelaya's departure had mobilized on Wednesday the followers of the fallen President, who had gone to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, and the military there had intensified their efforts.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the Putsch government's position.
This, according to his assessment, revealed the marginal nature of this government in the light of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the People's Inquiry organized by him to prepare for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica he had returned surprisingly on September 21st and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
He leaves them, he is detained for high betrayal, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The Putsch President, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo had been recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street in the upswing, the US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded with a high on Thursday, the US trade balance figures show a price recovery of US shares and their partners: Dow Jones increased by 0.67%, and Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the stock exchange closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, has risen from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor ÃÅs 500 was posted at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There are good news from various industries, Lindsey Piegza judged by FTN Financial.
This, however, remains anecdotal under the assumption that the market is focused only on "half-full glasses", as it moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly based on the US trade balance figures "which show an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared to September.
On the contrary, the analysts had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the rise in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the US main trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell from the company's research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen in line with all expectations last week and have now reached 474,000 requests.
However, over the last four weeks, the average for new job seekers "had fallen to the bottom of the year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of public bonds for 10 years has increased to 3,482 % compared to the 3,432 % on Tuesday evening, the profitability of the bonds for 30 years to 4,492 % compared to 4,408 % on the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of powerful partisans cry out "Women in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of partisans in Cuban power kicked out political prisoners' wives, gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day, and also denied another rally for a good dozen dissidents who were temporarily arrested.
Around forty women in Weiss, wives or close political prisoners, were kicked off by partisans of the government under Raul Castro on the open road, just as they were at the footwalk in the center of the city to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "S√∂ldner!", "The road belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fidel and Raul live!", the empowered partisans, with raised fist, were scanning against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared "to ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Dammen in Weiss" had taken place in Havana the evening before, where neither injured nor arrested.
On the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who were also on the demonstration held on Thursday in the face of the International Day of Human Rights, were temporarily arrested by civilian police officers, confirmed an AFP reporter.
According to this journalist, the police forced the partisans of the government to enter civilian vehicles using force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize, awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the Women in Weiss organised an unauthorized march for the purpose of "please allow all political prisoners to be released", the number of which according to the dissident list is around 200, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
Mr. Maceda is a member of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities see the opponents as "soldiers" or "agents" in the service of the declared enemy of the United States of America.
A rare thing in itself is that Cuban television produced a report about the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "contrarevolutionary" fighters.
Cuba, led by a unity party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of the violation of rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Insanity kills eighty-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two knife-armed madman killed an eighty-year-old on Friday against late afternoon at the main business time in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five more people.
According to the initial information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old for unknown reasons in or before a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police information, under the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is said to be responsible for the police union alliance in the hospital for the consequences of his injuries.
In or before the same pharmacy, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the three-sisters, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is at risk of life, as, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and according to a police source she has been hospitalized in the "shock state".
The armed man who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to police reports, should immediately have escaped to the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passersby, apparently by chance: a thirty- and a forty-year-old, while the latter of both heavy.
The scenario stayed in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives, which he had carried crossed behind his back, declared Arnaud Press√©, a member of the Syndicat Alliance of Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passersby, including young people, are said to have tried, according to the reports of the AFP, to reduce the madness.
I saw a guy in the three-sisters with a green vest.
Three youths tried to enter.
They couldn't do it because the guy was well-built, Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar, reported.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of number 61, two city police officers, including their superiors, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knives, according to police reports.
The event took place in one of the main lines of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby came to me to tell me that there's an injured person out there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I put her in first aid position and noticed a striking wound in the stomach area, told Fr√©d√©ric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured by cut wounds.
The police finally arrested the man who did not carry any identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has appointed the District Department of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out his being sent to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers had to take him to the Clichy police station, where he had been taken.
He found himself "in a state of exaggeration" like "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces release themselves during the Tathergang".
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for a rescheduling of criminal prosecution
The lawyer of French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to drop the prosecution of his client, who is currently in Switzerland due to a murder offence over 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", accused three judges of appeal in the second district of California of gross procedural errors at the time of the 1977 negotiation.
I ask for a fine on the spot, Mr Hummel said before adding that the behaviour of Judge Laurence Rittenband, appointed at the time of the trial with the case, "led down a cold back."
According to him, the judge Rittenband - who was now dead - had discussed with a public prosecutor before he took his case - who said that Roman Polanski had earned a breeding house, which represented a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), specifically by the inquiring prosecutor David Wells.
At the end of September, Mr. Wells had finally declared that he had "lyed" the authors of the documentary.
If the Court refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel asks for the conduct of a procedure which would enable him to present the evidence for his argument.
In turn, the prosecution repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the lifting of the charges imposed on the defendant cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears before the courts.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, even before the imposition of the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old underage.
Since then, he has not travelled to the United States.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, who are fleeing is a way out?, Ms. Asayma asks.
According to her, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favour and thereby despises his authority".
One of the three judges ‚Äì who now have 90 days to announce their decision ‚Äì even pointed out "that there would be other alternatives to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the arrest of Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the abolition of criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer endure being harassed by any resurgence of the Polanski affair and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years are enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on the basis of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, in anticipation of any extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise of the dollar and closes off without a price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed off on Friday without price in a market that was torn down between better than US indicators and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has given 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended index of Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"In honest terms, the market is quite quiet," said Mace Blickilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"He remains narrowly limited, the volume of trade has become very small and I think that this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than foreseen, which "contributed to improving the market view on the soundness of economic recovery", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus two months in succession and far more than planned.
In addition, US consumers' confidence has improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to index preview from the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes have been slowed down by a new rise in the dollar price, which has reached the highest level in the last two months compared to the euro, which '' will push down the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something to the ground.
The bond market has declined.
The yield of the ten-year Treasury bond increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared with 3.482% and the 30-year rate of the bond increased to 4.497% on the previous day's 4.492%.
Miss World elections again in South Africa
After a month's tour of South Africa, the 112 women candidates on Saturday will go beyond the last obstacle to make their dream come true: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and watch this in front of a billions of TV.
During this great beauty fair, which is being held for the second consecutive time in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already made their ticket to the semifinals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sports or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true mess of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, were simply extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and made a lot of experience!, Miss Sierra Leone said with enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, from 5 p.m. to 3 p.m. in Central Europe) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova emphasized in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with female candidates and the rediscovery of "breathing landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, encounters with the press and safari, the miss now focuses on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both were Bollywood stars.
It is of course the dream of every woman to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I would like to come home with the crown, Ms. India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional costumes and not to forget, in swimsuit.
The performance is presented by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a member of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with a hardly to be exaggerated cordiality and pride, says Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted by bike and local cuisine.
But the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them a hand, was quite exceptional.
Not usually for a head of state, Ms Sierra Leone remarked.
Their most beautiful memory, however, will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never get closer to.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Cup, Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi promised enthusiastically.
The news of Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured him on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well," explained David Hallyday to the press on his way out of the plane, where he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (2 p.m. MEZ) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would "quickly" go to the Cedars-Sina√Ø Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation at a disc incident on November 26th.
The singer was "translated into an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to alleviate his severe pain and to be able to perform his treatment, announced the press service.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by the doctors at the Cedars-Sina√Ø Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was delivered to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection following a disc surgery on November 26th.
The singer had to undergo surgery again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the ill changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event on Friday morning in the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer of the AFP arrested.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at Piti√© Hospital, Yves Caton√©, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer severely burdened neurosurgeon Dr. St√©phane Delajoux, who operated on 26 November in the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had executed the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were totally terrified, Mr Camus explained.
I've heard about the possibility of a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has travelled far too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I made a personal phone call with this doctor who assured me that he considered this journey completely unproblematic, which had surprised me very much, because I already have two disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr St√©phane Delajoux is well known in the artist environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a haematoma after a brain bleeding.
However, he is also a highly doubtful doctor, who has been sentenced several times for failing operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Chamber, referred to him as "a man without scruples", who has to be "regularly" accountable to the board of directors and "everything else as advisable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. St√©phane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
This explained that the intervention would have "perfectly passed" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "does not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage", he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer whose health problems have opened since last summer seems to be in question.
It is obvious that it is a little too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
UDF (Union for French Democracy) is becoming energetic and calls on the New Centre Party to stop using its seal.
On Friday, the Alliance of the Parties, supervised by Fran√ßois Bayrou's MoDem Party, reacted violently to an attempt to take over the seal, which was once founded by Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, on behalf of the president of the New Centre Party, Herv√© Morin, and called on him, in the face of a judicial persecution, not to use this seal on any document.
Herv√© Morin publicly announces his intention to accept this UDF seal, as he believes that Fran√ßois Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political heritage after he reached the left hand.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
He had received the support of Mr Herv√© de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who claims to be the property of the brand UDF, since he first applied for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriet industrielle" (Institut national de la propriet industrielle).
However, the office of the UDF alliance of parties, supervised by Fran√ßois Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they did not give up and set a deadline for the Minister and the Member, under threat of judicial persecution, to stop using this seal and to transfer to it the property rights of the trade mark.
In recent days you have made numerous statements that you would propose your political movement to take over the UDF seal +, the Alliance of Parties wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including Fran√ßois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You probably also believed you would have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the slogan + of today's UDF +, on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this seal, the UDF office explained and asked the NC party "to remove the name UDF from all material as well as from (their) website".
In addition, Herv√© de Charette was asked "to transfer the property rights of the trade mark to its legal rightholders".
If you refuse to do so, we will bring an action against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter they stress that "UDF "has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds that Morin and his friends "have made the election" to leave this 2007 to form a competing movement, as other parties had already done in 2002 to form the party "UMP".
The New Centre Party therefore has no rights, according to the signatory, to use the UDF seal (Union pour la d√©mocratie fran√ßaise).
It continues to recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 adopted the three-year membership of the MoDem Party and the establishment of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Herv√© de Charette is concerned, the branch continues, "he was not a member of the UDF for three years since he applied for the brand name, but of the UMP.
He profited in a scandalous and fraudulent manner, from the lack of the deposit of the acronym UDF to do so for himself.
Furthermore, please bear in mind that this carelessness is the best way to turn into a criminal offence, and ironicize the NC's strategy: "It seems to us in politics as well as in life to make ourselves a name rather than trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently acquiring a name that has no legal claim".
Case Liliane Bettcourt : Fran√ßois-Marie Banier is sentenced for exploitation of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist Fran√ßois-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettcourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of eighty-year-olds in order to lubricate part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to take responsibility for the exploitation of weakness in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a crime that is punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of three years and a penalty of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair worthy of the Saga of one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter are fettered and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Or√©al.
Similarly, however, the 15th Criminal Chamber ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Or√©al has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, in particular not under the conditions laid down by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigations.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to present a report before March 10, 2010, in which you clearly state whether and at what time Liliane Bettencourt may have found himself in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these investigations.
I'm going to talk to her, explained to Ms. Betendcourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As for the lawyer of Fran√ßoise Bettcourt-Meyers, Mr Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (bankers) manipulated this old lady, who must be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettcourt has initiated a criminal lawsuit against Fran√ßois-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accuses him of having exploited the weakness of her mother for years to make up donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettcourt had always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she sees as a long-standing friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Betendcourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleas led to a large family debacle on Friday.
For example, the lawyer of Liliane Bettcourt called on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she was distrusting the husband of Fran√ßoise Bettcourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettcourt added: "If you could please explain to my daughter that I have been writing to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
Fran√ßoise I have never been able to speak since her marriage".
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office again considers that the applicant had no right to react in this way, especially because in the last few days a guardian has refused her application to initiate a legal proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no guardianship.
No one has the right to act in their place," confirmed Marie-Christine Daubigney, representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The court has now decided to issue a judgment after the trial for the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager revolution or the end of early strategic education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-√†-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined the best as it had previously been designed to hang on to the consumer products by the technicians in the factory.
By placing the customer at the center of the companies the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose the preferences of the customers again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of R & D, which is even more crucial, on those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economy = Economic Intelligence) calls for "a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach by all the parties involved"; it claims from the employees a commitment that completely contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for a business revolution, which would consist in putting employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as customers.
The very underlying benefits of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practices?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that, given a new situation after many detours, the whole structure finally needs to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
Her interpretation of psychology is mechanistic from the great engineering schools.
They are taking over by intellectual comfort the old behavioral theory recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and unknowingly spread by research institutes and the media.
Thus and by suggesting that it is possible to activate the "hebels" (sic) for the engagement of employees, an up-to-date survey of Ipsos published by Le Figaro.fr strengthens the executives in an attitude towards a mechanical control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, a business revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol into any reflection or practice of governance: for wage earners, the commitment for the company is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means of achieving part of their dreams, ambition and projects.
At the moment, the only studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a specified dox that allows them to assess through their perceived image of the company what it offers them to achieve their living goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resource management back on the right track.
Thus, they create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
American rights welcomed the speech delivered by Barack Obama in Oslo on Friday night and were pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who had mocked the award of the award to Obama on 9 October this time applauded the President's speech, following the example of the former Vice-President at the 2008 elections of Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily USA Today and added that she herself had raised the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in memoirs published just now.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence in Oslo on Thursday; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the view that the President had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words Obama.
In some parts, I felt this speech to be completely historical, said Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former Member, who is regarded by some as a potential candidate for the 2012 Republican nomination, said he was pleased to have seen a "Left President" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "are not free and could not deliver a prize for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech."
In addition to being a "cosmopolit," as "he always does," he has "speaked like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live like a security bubble that they did not create themselves and for whose protection they do not do much," says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the Bush era, described the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "tired, boring and uninspiring".
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the use of the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, the massacre can be simply justified on the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left remains praiseworthy on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize has been awarded to Obama prematurely, called the speech itself a "monumental work" for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "provides a roadmap for the management of international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the Californian daily says enthusiastically.
The New York Times believes that Obama "declared the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Remote Drivers: Three Marathons for an agreement that secures the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Roads Association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation that remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening that would put an end to the strike command and the threat of heavy supply congestion at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, welcomed the agreement initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiation.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators broke up early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement early in the morning.
Even though the three employers‚Äô associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 the agreement was signed.
The conflict "had caused a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages thus rises from 8,72 euros to 9,06 euros.
"That's not very much, but we start small at first," says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now required to stop blocking the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some rebels who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF President Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement" although it was "difficult to accommodate these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is at EUR 170 per month for the low wage groups and at EUR 100 to 120 for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Doulin (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs, as well as the maintenance of the overall road transport quota in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable the 13th month's pay and the modernisation of collective agreements to be addressed.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction in employers' taxes of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the draft law on corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly at night from Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for an identical vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to initially apply to the enterprises associated with this organisation and then apply to the whole occupation in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in no time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the proceedings.
The FNTR association denounced a "frauding trade" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to defeat the Gans-Esser on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre association, the agreement threatens to "store a large grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Interruptions this weekend, unions with RATP proposals dissatisfied
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest speed train network in France for the Greater Paris area and the √éle-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd strike day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration) allows strikers to keep waiting with their demands for pay increases.
There were no trains on this important shopping weekend before Christmas between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central track (between La D√©fense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central track was only one of four trains ready for use.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced travellers to change.
The retail chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big shops to traffic technology".
The RER A line passes through the Paris metropolitan area from the west to the east.
The section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-L√©ger and Marne-La-Vall√©e.
On Friday, approximately one of the two trains scheduled for the main traffic time, and almost none during the low traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no sense of human being on the track, as the inhabitants of √éle-de-France had set themselves up for the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, especially because of the lack of gymnasians.
In Boissy-Saint-L√©ger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), said that he would have "extended one and a half hours earlier to get to work on time."
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to travellers by staff and law enforcement, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at the Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of the Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via the station Saint-Lazare to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, annual meetings of the strikers took place again, during which the results that the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leadership summit on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed to draw up a specific protocol for RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
But that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (South) they demand a long-term pay supplement.
The CGT was upset by the fact that the RATP itself puts its salary payment proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is unable to solve a problem, while this was possible with the long-distance drivers and SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting was planned for Monday for the "comprehensive examination of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "misses the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the headquarters of a committee in Paris.
It was once again the lead who refused any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to line RER B after a pre-announcement by Usa and independent.
The associations call for a salary supplement of 120 (unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independent), and they also complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers travel daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have many years of professional experience, receive a gross salary of 2.200 to 2.700 euros as well as a salary supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision to follow immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the Government extremely difficult to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts which have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "place for activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kili√ß four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kli√ß, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose a resolution. Furthermore, he pointed out that 37 of the party‚Äôs leaders, including Ahmet T√ºrk and Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political process for a period of five years.
In addition, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, enjoying the Turkish and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than meet as non-party parliamentarians.
The decision followed a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yal√ßinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "consecrations" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political display window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no connection to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court is between the Government seeking to meet the Kurdish community and proposing a series of measures to strengthen the Kurdish rights to allow Kurdish PKK support and to put an end to the conflicts.
The DTP leaders confirm that a resolution could lead to a re-emergence of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against PKK chief Abdullah √ñcalan's detention conditions had led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the DTP premises in the millions of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The officers used tear gas grenades and waterlights when the demonstrators started throwing molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, T√ºrk assumed that the court's decision "will further deepen despair".
"Turkey cannot clarify this question (Kurdish, Note d. redaktion) on the basis of a party's prohibition," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closure of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic openness promoted by the government," said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously turn to a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most brutal attacks of the past months.
The snowfall may come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
But so that his employees can try out the whole vehicle technology and learn to master it.
In the weekend it could be so far for the first time according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are available to take care of snow and ice.
The FES will proceed according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows wide in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero, 20 so-called A-tracks will be driven by large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include major roads such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstra√üe.
But also fire services, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with traps, such as the Atzelbergstra√üe.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which is better liable.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "that's why the routes are free until the traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it only snows at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to fit the scatter vehicles".
Only after this, if it does not continue to snow, are delivery and development roads, including the Rat-Beil-Stra√üe, on the line.
The final priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the foothills of the FES make their way, hazard points and transitions are cleared first.
The FES is usually not able to take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt which keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 pm, says Brauburger.
As there is a fast level, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, this will also be called by the police.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-eating dinosaurs: The two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-long animal ran on two strong hind legs, had a long skull with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with silky claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa haloae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was at that time in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging on Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaurs in a day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional find: "Dinosaur fossils from the trias are extremely rare, usually only single pieces are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
The dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago after the current lesson.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these original dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the echsen split into their three main development lines: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor, and also the birds, the four-legged souropods known as "long-necks" and their relatives, and the plants-eating ornithischia (Vogelbecksauries), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues Tawa hugae is an original theropod.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, the researchers found, for example, evidence of airbags, as well as the descendants of the Theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
At Tawa haloae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge Sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight knuckles, probably the common ancestors of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the Echsen appeared there for the first time.
As a result, the three development lines split early and spread from South America over all parts of the earth, which at that time still formed a single land mass as supercontinent Pangea.
For this, the fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the remains of two more, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot descend from a common immigrant ancestors, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today‚Äôs Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give rise to a distorted picture because in South America, particularly many primitive dino-fossils have been preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile strain to the dominant agricultural vertebrates of the Earth's Middle Ages, it is still mysterious.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flying aurier and with numerous other leeks.
Towards the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the relationship at the border of the Trias to the Jura passed away.
Success Story Didn't Last Forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a group of animals that had also developed in the Trias and since then had been fed with shadows: the mammals had been affected by a meteorite attack.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto are at the University of Cambridge, University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Lecturers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police room of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University is beating waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, as well as from universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, join forces with the protesting students on Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "dismiss" the use of police by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner M√ºller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike cleared last week, because walls and works of art had been embroidered.
Five students were injured.
The damage to property, judge the signatories, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The room represents a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and derives from the contents.
The Bureau had withdrawn the necessary discourse.
The lecturers call for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of besetters did not support the damage to property, it is said.
Protest legitimised
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for your own future, says Verdi-Landesjugend Secretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hessen's Minister of Science Eva K√ºhne-H√∂rmann (CDU) defended the actions of the United President and the police.
We are grateful to the United President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a recent hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, according to CDU's deputy Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions saw SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of discussing the arguments and demands of the students, one has cleared up.
The left has submitted a request to the Minister of the Interior to report on the use of the police.
New Silicon Valley
For many years she was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded location in the Soviet Union for secret armaments research.
Today, with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, the municipality is considered a "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have established contacts with the Frankfurt science centre Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow deputy mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signing for Frankfurt planner Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to take a foothold on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to obtain orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the major companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armaments research.
Selenograd (literally "Green City") was named after the forested hill landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set up at all high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than laying down a railway station, more than a monster construction project, which will plunge the city of Baden-W√ºrttemberg's capital for a decade into hopeless construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
Railway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then considered to be 19th-century traffic fossils, which acted as brake blocks of modern rail traffic, as it once took an enormous amount of time to transform locomotives from the rear to the front.
Get in, hold on, keep going - so let's go.
And that's why the main train stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is located about half-way of the trans-European rail-magistrals between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost unpayable in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals to implement the deep down.
Railway stations, however, no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there have been modern turning trains with motor vehicles and cabs at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 next to the new ICE line to Ulm is now under way.
It has been enforced by national and municipal politicians.
The railway also contributes because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project of the Republic of the taxpayer and not of the state corporations are borne.
In urban areas, the project can still be justified to some extent.
A new urban space is created, which - if you believe the computer-generated graphics of planners - is equipped with lots of green.
The S21 is harmful to the rail system.
The transit railway station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, to which, typically in the 1980s, enormous growth was attributed.
At that time, there was no competition from the low-cost pilots.
However, modern transport policy must first be about strengthening freight transport, since transport on the rail is much more environmentally friendly than by road.
However, the new construction line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy climbs.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be banned in the Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts think ten to 15 billion are realistic.
It's firm, the next decade the money will be missing at other node points and narrow places in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 km long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built in a slow pace.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake bolt.
The Rhine Valley Route becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government verifies judgment on the airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will review the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the VGH judgment of more than 400 pages reviewed legally, said Minister for Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On these days, the VGH in Kassel had submitted in writing that in the case of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as provided for by the national government, should not be compatible with the statutory protection of the population from nocturnal noise.
The coalition must decide until 4 January whether to oppose the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticised this delay and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD Group leader Torsten Sch√§fer-G√ºmbel called on CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises for a night flight ban. Otherwise, this would be considered a "worship."
It's fucking hard to keep his word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP election slogan "We keep word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation by Sch√§fer-G√ºmbel that the state government is trying to come to their night flights with "right-wing and trickery".
A precise legal examination needs its time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan M√ºller (FDP).
As the opposition points out, his group's statements on the night flight ban had never been.
US banks pay back help
The crisis-torn US major banks are tearing off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back one-off aid from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund totalling $45 billion (good 30 billion).
And the Citigroup also plans, according to a report by the US station CNBC, to repay the state aid.
The institutions want to remove the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money ‚Äì such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had raised good 19 billion dollars of fresh money from investors via convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from its own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by department sales.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: the money injection helped over a very difficult time.
The Geldhaus had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market for exemption from its liabilities to the State.
Already on Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported calling on circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to speak out.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Fast Choice
Then everything went faster than thought.
Not more than two weeks after the ZDF board of directors forced the chief editor Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF Capital Studio in Berlin, was considered a favourite.
However, it was not officially confirmed by the broadcaster in order not to pre-empt the procedure.
However, the ZDF-intendent Markus Schachter should also not have been harmed by this proposal to the Management Board.
Frey, Sch√§chter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote was not yet clear at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Sch√§chter failed with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted in favour of Brender, seven voted against him. Brender‚Äôs rejection was a downright defeat for chessmen, but an expected defeat.
For the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm his position.
The opposition against the chief editor of Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch was organized.
With the argument that under Brender the ZDF's messages had lost their activation rates, he refused another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was looted.
In the final analysis, even 35 state courts had intervened in the debate, which considered Koch's action to be unconstitutional.
It has nothing to do with it.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked at the S√ºdwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to the "today-journal".
Subsequently stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderator of the morning magazine; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since the head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint following the resignation of Brender, who was still elected as journalist of the year by the sector paper Medium Magazin on Wednesday.
Mr Kochs‚Äôs opposition to the Board of Directors, Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the Director‚Äôs proposals for staff cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also excluded a withdrawal of party politicians from the ZDF's supervisory bodies.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended to the Board of Directors with a wise move - by strongly criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both chessmen without loss of face for the post of chief editor and to elect the board without suspecting that a party runner would take office.
Frey is already attributed to the left-liberals in party arithmetics.
Study is decomposed
Partial success for the students: After one year of the educational strike, the Ministers of Culture of the countries decided on Thursday: at a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Higher Education Conference, both sides agreed to improve the conditions for Bachelor and Master's degrees.
Students should be able to master their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: basically, each study module should only conclude with a single test.
In addition, the student's workload will be reviewed and "a realistic and acceptable measure" will be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries undertook to make common structural guidelines for Bachelor and Master's programmes more flexible.
There should also be no different national rules.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have been wearing the winged word of better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module usually concludes with only one examination", it says in a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of study programmes.
With the "clear reduction in the burden of verification", the Accreditation Council Chairman Reinhold Grimm stated that "mistakes should be prevented, which significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, "studyability" is to be "the decisive criterion" in the design in the future.
Modules such as content should be "stressed to check" whether "necessary inferences of students in the choice of the
Events" would be avoided.
The students would have the "claim to have room for manoeuvre, to enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses of study, but also to the review of existing courses.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years ‚Äì which, however, means that it takes until 2015 until all study programmes have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout the country, which are subject to the accreditation council established by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture called on the countries to "enforce" the agencies so that they were not too large and that the regime of examination was not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, the Rhineland-Palatinate allocated additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
The aim of the money is to set up tutor programmes and to strengthen student counselling as well as examination and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government plans to introduce a new law on higher education into Parliament.
After this, only one test is required to complete a study model.
The aim is to make the design of the studies more flexible, to ensure recognition of qualifications at other universities and to facilitate access to the Master's degree programme.
By the end of next year, all the country's study programmes will be checked for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again argued about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso University Groups called for the design of education policy to no longer take place in future "closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, students as affected should also "speak a word".
The future academics were supported by the President of the University Rectors Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with which the HRK discussed a joint reform paper on Thursday.
The trade union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough to make Bonn decisions: it calls for a legal claim that allows every graduate with a Bachelor's degree to have access to a further master's degree course.
On the other hand, the countries need to ensure that the current generation of Bachelor students will have sufficient Master's places available tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, says GEW Executive Board member Andreas Keller.
There is a need for a clear increase in the number of lecturers in countries.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves on a free entry to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta M√ºller
Entering Germany and leaving is almost uncontrollable..." is the starting line of a poem by the lyric Werner S√∂llner, in which he addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Werner S√∂llner had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a editor in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
S√∂llner has been awarded with various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt Poetic Lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, during a conference in Munich, he caused a considerable extra-literal appearance, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the reflection of their securities".
S√∂llner left out a statement in which he agreed to work as an IM for the Romanian Secret Service Securitate, among others Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the participants, S√∂llner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun sluggishly, first in 1971.
I am, S√∂llner concluded, "so someone who has not resisted enough attempts at intimidation by the Securitas."
The poet Werner S√∂llner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prizes for Herta M√ºller and their unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that makes clear the merits and the oppression of a political system based on monitoring and discernment.
Werner S√∂llner is, as far as you can say after previous knowledge, not only the perpetrators, but also the victims.
IM Walter played a role in his Securities Act, said after S√∂llner's confession of literary scientist Michael Markel and pointed out the positive influence of IM Walter on him.
He "cut him out in all the difficult points for him at the time," says Markel.
It would be a moral need for him to make this remark.
S√∂llner's statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but it is not surprising that a former dissident's confession and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitas Spitzel, Herta M√ºller had already written in July after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The persons concerned, in this way, may be suspected, are speculative and in some cases have probably also known, which clear name is hidden behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
Unlike in the country in the meantime, the very process-proof sighting of the Stasi shares is still very diffuse in dealing with the legacys of the Securitas supervision.
Systematic information has been delayed and hindered in recent years.
One of the birthler authorities of the corresponding National Council for the Preparation of the Securities Shares (CNSAS) was only established in 1999 but the issue of the files has been rather slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law regulating the administration of files.
After the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta M√ºller, an interview showed that the influence of former Securitas members in Romania is still very high, in which a former Securitas chief from Temesvar spoke about the award winner.
She has a psychosis, and finally, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power here meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of S√∂llner, as is often the case in connection with hidden guilt, raises unavoidable questions.
Why now? Who has been harmed? The prudent response of the listeners to S√∂llner's confession suggests that the continuation of this chapter will be determined rather by desire for knowledge than by guilt and shame.
The result of Herta M√ºller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if a very nice outdoor servant had just come from a very nice Christmas party on which a sports goods manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the outfitter, rose to a cold C class after midnight. Ãà
The man with the striking glasce could be heated because of the strange city.
Otherwise he could have been driving himself - alcohol was finally not in the game, and drunk before luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work goes on.
Or let's just get going.
In the words of the Swiss only three days earlier: "We have achieved the eighth finale", namely, in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal battle against the descent."
The "much more important task" is ahead of Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the royal performance in Mainz in the league everyday.
And to remove the once again revealed weaknesses after the fast three gates through Marica (5.), Trasch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Redemption
The 8th Final of the Champions League (game 16/17. + 23/24 February/remote 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released in Nyon on December 18.
So the joy over the fulminant attitude of the Babbel Successor remained.
Not only with the supposed healer, who had given the uncertain Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, commitment and joy of playing in the short period of time.
I went to the players and told them to think about their strengths and stopped them to be more brave, Soulenklempner Gross explained the so simple recipe for success, which had no effect under Therapist Babbel.
He has triggered a certain magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "if football has a new impulse, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought were possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week-long break of injury, made the same progress as the best player in the place, tried to describe the identified "phenomena" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new superior: "He is a man who penetrates through and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
It had obviously been lacking under Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports director Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs, however, especially Konstanz.
Like Gross, players and managers also took care of overvaluing the victory against a weak and completely overstated defense of Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening had come to think of Khedira.
And Chief Sports Officer Horst Heldt warned that although one goal of the season was achieved, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after the first home win for three months was not true to the events of the weekend, which took the form of a television interview by Torh√ºter Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, Heldt countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of directors of weakness and had decided to change the coach to pressure puberty fans.
The fact that his free day had been removed after playing, Lehmann also regarded as a sign of lack of sovereignty and regret.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure egoism," Heldt returned and announced consequences for the final man.
I don't think you're gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with all the others that without the preliminary work by the replaced coach team the playfully and combatfully strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share in the success", Heldt and Lehmann unisono said - and the man also agreed with the plastic bag.
WM-Fight in Heavy Weight
Hot Duell in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title after the WBC version.
The judge's ruling was unanimously rejected.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box world champion in gravity.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the association WBC defeated the American Kevin Johnson in Bern on the night to Saturday unanimously (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it did not work with the K.o., which everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance sheet on 39 victories in 41 professional struggles, twice he had to surrender due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-metre-large Klitschko wanted to dictate the struggle with his left hand.
The 11 centimetres smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly escaped the battles of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not achieve his dangerous rights decisively.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings only rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had provided some vortex before the battle in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "hately zombie" who "can't do anything right".
On Friday, the champion was then provoked to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko was also victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to leave without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the USA in September.
In this fight I got only one blow and I am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt of the WBA is worn by the British David Haye after he was able to dethrone the 2.13-metre-large Nikolai Walujev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September in the summer.
According to his PhD company, he is already planning the fight against Klitschko in London's Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader J√ºrgen Trittin called the defense minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left demand clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the recent findings on Kunduz's air attack, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has made a conscious deception.
For the deadly bombing on two September tankload trains, the Minister said "knowing the truth", Green Group leader J√ºrgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news programme "Dayshow".
It's commonly called, he lied.
The killing order had been issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read, Mr Guttenberg said.
On Friday, it had become known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the kidnapped trucks, but also about the purpose of killing two Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people had been killed or injured in the US air attack requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
Green, SPD and left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy - and whether Chancellor, Federal Defence and Intelligence have endorsed this new strategy, J√ºrgen Trittin and Gr√ºnen-Kollegin Renate K√ºnast asked.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office did not influence concrete Federal Defence operations in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the Ministry's presentation of the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and completely informed about the backgrounds of the tankloader attack.
Officially, they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, from around the two top officials, they said that they had even referred to several reports by the Ministry of Defence, including a two-page document by the commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sundayszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, it is said.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not comment on the accusations and pointed out that this will be clarified in the Bundestag's Committee of Inquiry, which will be formed next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some people see images in awe and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill and in the case of drugs, the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unhinderedly give ourselves to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, anyone who experiences traumatic conditions in the wake, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is usually considered crazy or drug addicted in the modern Western world, at least as a special.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the case of mentally ill or in the case of drugs.
Guilty has our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes cause the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality to blur.
Dream-like altered states of consciousness can occur in various forms, at best we call them visions, in worst case madness.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic raptures, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messengers of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is released and the interaction of various brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no more power over him
The connection between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861 expressed a "great similarity of error with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, sensory shocks of such a state".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turned into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and smooth.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him are the devils with red, distorted fracturing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, burning boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Louds, malicious voices drift from walls and radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, knots them to a loop and fastens them to a hook on the ceiling.
He rises to a speaker and lays the loop around his neck.
Run.
The loop's breaking.
This is supposed to be a lesson for you, shouting the voices in a drumming choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years back, the first almost 20 years old.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, also he is manic-depressive, he takes medication against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and the deepest despair, he says.
The cheating images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the internal and the external world; they get into an overly excited state that can lead to hallucinations, magnitude, relationship or persecution.
Voice listening - voices that command, comment or dialogue is particularly common.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The person concerned can no longer separate important from immaterial, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the loopholes for a flood of ideas and imaginations that originate from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the General Psychiatry Hospital at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenia is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time, he takes a passive role; he is overwhelmed, as in his dream, by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually not possible for them, the cheating images are cruel reality, awakening excluded.
To have experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains basically preserved."
The crazy thoughts and hallucinations walk in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real context.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers are still puzzled.
Exceptions can result in any human being losing the relation to reality in a short time, Fuchs says.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic incentive for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the sole determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in patients.
We suspect that the brain's neuronal ripening will be disrupted at an early stage of development, for example, by a mother's viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But there remains a mystery as to how the disorder of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at first for many years at all.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychoses as they interfere in the transmitter system.
When our brain goes hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which, says the L√ºbeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether false images are perceived as pleasant or uncomfortable is often just a question of the point of view.
For ten years, Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and scams, and last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Real World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are one of the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of amazingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and cervical trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions the brain of healthy people is hallucinating.
Hallucinations, according to the caste, are composed of memories that are normally held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also attractive withdrawal, stress, love spasm or other mental exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents indicated that they had experienced hallucination at least once in life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the gymnasium.
A normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
In the break it may happen that a slimy boy with long dark hair speaks to it.
When it answers him, the students look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spontaneous daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other fake images are not real and disappear again.
At night, the phenomena are mostly frightening
Often the fake images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just introducing a new fellow student, while he explains mathematical equations to everyone else in the table.
At night, the phenomena are mostly frightening.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and far too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees are the fracturing or the girl with the bloody cuts on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the characters.
Parents and friends don't tell her anything that would make her crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed her Abitur last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she made contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Wohn is also a work of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or suffering from irritation, he is very likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Boxes.
I guess the brain is then underemployed and takes care of its own conversation.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children when she was a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned with 13 that the man she calls Dad since she can think of is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish between false images and reality. "Every experience", says caste, "finds in the brain, reality is formed there.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to develop, so they seem so real."
Nightly dream images also value boxes as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenia, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their false images as unrealistic.
Boxes therefore advise his patient to value the hallucinations as a special ability.
Limit between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our over-conscious world, imaginary experience is usually pathologicalized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Psychiatry and Psychotherapy Clinic of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in D√ºsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, sad illness, but it also contains positive, creative, delusional artwork.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroide form of experience, a special form of traumatic altered consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experiencer thinks are real and which he cannot distinguish from the wake-state in the afterlife.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
If a person is threatened with self- and world-loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline between dream and hallucination.
Since the management of a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is reflected in the imagination.
An intense form of sensational foundation and sensation in a situation that is inherently unbearable, which enables us humans' own ability to design, not to perish in a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Change of the Heart" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplant, while his body is sentenced to motionlessness in the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-made world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bedtime, old man, on board a train ananatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobility to produce the drugs from blood.
When dragged by a Greek on a motorcycle in his home country, his hospital bed surfes in the alpine firn snow and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes up completely in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, after years of mental travel and in minor details, I still find the memories seem to be ambiguous.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says Psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug abuse show how brutally our inner images of external reality are in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarized by the psychologist box, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall may come
Burda
Children are supposed to take over the publisher at age 27
The new publishing director Kallen is an interim solution: In the long term Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
In the future, the holding company is expected to belong to 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at age 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, said the 69-year-old to SPIEGEL.
We have regulated the details of this on a precautionary basis.
The question of whether they are also active in the company only arises afterwards.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
You cannot introduce 7500 employees to your children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will withdraw from the board of directors from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury Division, responsibility for corporate assets was added and after the departure of J√ºrgen Todenh√∂fer also the responsibility for direct marketing, foreign, pressure and finance.
For the first time there is no family member at the head of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, said Burda.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda stated that even family companies are not sure of the downfall: "This always concerned families that were infected by a capital search that had completely sprung up and thought that they could rise to the great player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "no world power dreams," says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play 'Time' in the World League, these stores have grown too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Ingl√©s has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything is just about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find renowned companies such as Hedonai, which provide a hair removal with lasers; Spaxi√≥n, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that develops through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
To enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends on your feet and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities Spaxi√≥n offers.
The total area is 250 m2, divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has these types of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is located opposite the devices.
After that, you will find various videos to show you how to properly perform your training sessions.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warming up and stretching exercises) are perfectly sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if you want to pass the hair salon after exercising your body, Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments to regain hair splendor, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The most diverse decorations
Christmas is getting closer and closer and therefore it is again a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and bring their party dresses into our wardrobe.
The form of the decollet√©, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that needs to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decollet√©. You can only advise about this.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, created the "LIVE office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make arrangements regarding mobility through management, coordination, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed in order to promote the electric car and to summarise opinions and actions in the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of rest" for the automotive sector
The president of the government, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, prophesies of the Spanish automotive industry, the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace".
At the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures taken by the government to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Without the Car Industry Competitiveness Plan, we now have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the automobile manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry in the future, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall car industry plan (PIA), provided ‚Ç¨800 million for projects by 19 car manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided more than ‚Ç¨3 billion in investment.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's efforts to boost demand, in reference to the 2000E plan, which is applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the automotive manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows an average reduction of 6% in the emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market , which in turn led to a "strong increase" in the number of approvals that increased "by 40%" in November .
On 20,000 square meters classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classic Motor Show, an exhibition for experts and fans from the world of engines, is held.
This fair will take place from 5th to 7th February 2010 at the Pabell√≥n de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally sustainable sport
Mazda wants to prove that sport is quite compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and stop system of the engine, named i-stop, with the Mazda3 model, a device which is only currently available for the 2.0-fuel engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 stands out through their good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
Furthermore, the steering wheel's game is excellent.
Further looking at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, you can see that Mazda is with a variety of buttons and switches in the striking colours red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us of the Honda Civics style.
That is why it can be said that both Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the soberness of German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive the car easily.
To all this comes a spacious and clearly shaped suitcase room.
The stop and start system is only available for the 2-litre 150 hp petrol engine and a 6-speed power supply.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out through its fineness, its silent noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don't drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in switching and its low consumption, even though in Mazda in particular the diesel models are the most sold.
In terms of the equipment, the so-called Sportive model chosen for the test drive is a special feature, since it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the standard equipment, especially the RVM, which removes the dead angle, also the controls for traction and stability, speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth as well as the chrome-plated 17-inch panels, is the main highlight of the RVM.
In addition, this version also includes, as if it were not yet enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to additional elements, especially the educational bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who don't return many kilometers a year can also purchase the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 150 hp petrol engine.
The only negative on this model is its slightly high price, which is between 21.770 euros for the model Luxury and 23.270 euros for the tested model Sportive.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day a new highest driving pass.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red tepppich of sensuality for Pen√©lope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, radiated more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is too limited, a device with which you can only read its emails, without the possibility of seeing certain attachments or surfing through the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is more unlikely to be seen on the street, but the idea itself is nevertheless of interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flatrate, for example only half of the price of the flatrate of an iPhone.
After the company saw the success with it, it launched two new devices: one that was only intended for Twitter, the other with a life-long free data service, as opposed to the Peek, where you have to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, approximately 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those traveling with a smartphone around the world already know what it means to give up all the data in order to be able to read its emails as soon as you have crossed the national border or if you desperately are looking for a caf√© with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is already true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the small printed ones.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe almost always ignored.
Outside their own country, people are always afraid of reading their emails and rightfully reading that.
The fact that a small device such as FonPeek (where it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, although it does not have a Wi-Fi/WLAN) can offer this kind of tariff means that telephone providers need to think slowly but safely and start to consider different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, his prices include downloading books and further inquiries on the Internet.
No movement and no hooks.
This is an Internet-ready device and you only pay for it a single time, i.e. when you buy it, and not a month for a month.
And that's exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a shopping opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it already offers in the US.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I'll read my emails by phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Even at Barack Obama's appointment as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this colour and has chosen the same color again to accompany him at his second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: besides that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric, and for that she wore something large embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far as to appear at first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
She wore a lace dress when she was introduced to her office and a patterned velvet in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: at the first time green shoes with half-high heels and at the second time an ephemeral model, but gold-coloured.
The hairstyle was also different each time: the hair had been put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, on the previous one she wore the hair open.
75 % of working mothers have problems at work due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of CSIC's study "Fructility and Career of Women in Spain" conducted in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of employed women see their career opportunities limited on the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to set up a family and the number of children depending on whether the women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they practice.
Those of them who do not perform any other activity outside the house, only work half day or have no fixed contract of employment, are more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with fixed-term employment, especially in the public sector, are moving away from the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore also have fewer children.
"Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with fixed-term employment only get their first child on average 3.7 years after the date of marriage, a figure which increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed-term employment who have needed longer to achieve this and who have only realized the first child much later.
Furthermore, the type of work also has a major influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar of conception," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account at the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, age at the time of marriage and the first child is all the higher, the higher the educational level.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they have only primary education or higher education, became mothers on average with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
Moreover, depending on the level of education, there is a further difference between women.
While the women with the main degree already marry before their first permanent position and get their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree make it exactly the other way around and seek a permanent position and marry afterwards and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Or√©al Paris recently added a new name to its well-known list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The main actress from "Joyeux No√´l", one of the most elegant actors at the international level, will become another famous outing as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Pen√©lope Cruz.
In front of her were the last to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In the case of men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ÃÅs Anatomy") and Matthew Fox ("Lost") of Evangeline.
The UK fashion industry award ceremony
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They all appeared on this occasion.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model this year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) the thirty X-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear - inspiring genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks for an anehenity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent saves neither fear nor enlightenment.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the calamitous fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an amazing poetic humor, without any sense, such as the signposts who had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was drawn by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, to the extent that she was banned, in whose flesh the emotions due to the adultery united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in coming to heaven on the way to destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8,000 peaks in the world's literature, you have to climb up on the north wall, on the wall, on which the best climbers always try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a strange causation.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and another time he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand C√©line: This writer took up the insane cry that was screamed out of a bridge from that personality from Munich so that his echo would go deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. He did this on a journey on which he fled himself and called the afterworld with a speech full of violence against the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled herself and prayed, "My honorable God, I beg you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: ' sleep after effort,/ after the storm of the harbour,/ peace after war,/ after a full life you will find pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also had her depressions.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII spied them out between the azaleas or sang the birds in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man was as patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was much greater than her madness."
About P√≠o Baroja: "What else did Mart√≠n Santos do than try to get Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did this do except destroy the glory of that man so that he can put himself on this podium?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother went walking through our district last week in the village of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 came down next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixer that we have brought out of the shelter and that weighs just six kilos, and then they missed him from the warmest sky two steps and hurt him hard with it.
It is not at all possible to express our horror, because it is incomprehensible to us, because the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which has naturally been carried out on the leash.
In addition, the stifling attack that a woman who went for a pleasant walk was given when she wanted to treat these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacked a dog, he might also be doing the same with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a usually quiet district at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have returned to a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our intimidation about the events has led us to point out this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for the animals and persons remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since this is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which "covers more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure every day" and further confirmed that it also contributes to achieving this goal every day with other educational and informational actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in an initial phase to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that the company's road safety is "a constant concern" and precisely because it is always committed as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles that one of its main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is up a bit again
After almost two years the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles authorised in Spain in November represent an increase of 12,6 % in 2008 and, much more importantly, they are the first increase after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, in line with the figures presented by Anfac and Ganvam.
However, these good figures are only to be seen with great caution at the moment, since the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad year of recession with a decrease of 60% over the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40 % lower than the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all the vehicles of which the small transporter market consists: arrivals of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small vans and lighter mini-cars/cars.
Furthermore, the same thunderstorm clouds are still in the sky, which most suffer from demand, because even if some of the cars are bought from private individuals, the bulk of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100 % of all cases make the purchase with third-party financing.
These restrictions, which are the result of the turnaround of credit institutions, must therefore be accompanied by further factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
With this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support for buying a 2000E car has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small businesses have a right to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission not exceeding 160 grams per km driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday Ganvam recalled that it is absolutely necessary for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to the industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The car dealer association predicts for 2010 a year similar to the year that it has just passed, for which it expects a 19 % loss in sales (for passenger cars and land vehicles).
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the anti-lock braking system ABS, and as is currently the case with the stability control ESP, the auxiliary braking systems have to become mandatory in European cars in case of emergency.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and light-duty small transporters, for which the remaining vehicles have a period of grace until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measures adopted by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but due to their operation, these braking systems can also help prevent many road accidents.
The emergency brake assister's task is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake manoeuvre which detects the system on the brake pedal using the brake force carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to a study commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not stopped with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, reaches the braking system with maximum force and thereby reduces the braking time and thus the braking distance that a car places in the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assist.
There would be even fewer accidents - one expects that every fourth accident could be prevented with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (through radar or camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system will help him increase pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel until January
While the staff at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants the affected party to give its consent to each item of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will first be presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American carmaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also likes to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, which has back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever stronger acceptance.
If none of these buyers were to enter into an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it easier by 80 kilos, with which he now only weighs 1.275 kilos.
In order to create something like this, they first of all neglected the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent wall roof with manual drive, so that alone they saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3's "lost" another 15; by the removal of air conditioning again 13; moreover, they reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, thus saving another 7 kilos; by the installation of sporty bacquet seats again 12 and again five with the lightweight 19-inch legs.
Then, by abandoning the audio system CDR-30, one had reached another six kilos less and by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-coupling gear, the test drive was carried out with a 6-speed hand-driven vehicle, mainly on the smaller California highways, on mountain routes that were really very winding.
In his driving behavior, he can only be given a pointless note.
However, the reduction in his weight has in no way led to him not being so safe on the street.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for a long time we have not tried such a small and light model, which at the same time gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low speed in the required time until we give him the orders to shave, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything he is told, and the car does everything we suggest to him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the boxster S) has been excellent and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time at the Panamra.
Acceleration is unimaginable brutal, no matter whether from standing out or from reacceleration.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the highways on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car managed the impact holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route; and that although we found some of these curves ice in the morning gray and roll split on the morning.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as otherwise it may be rare and in it there is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stubbornness as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electro and thus came to the first place within his group after the grand performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triples (29 in the rating).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the major failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Mikov with a large dose of deployment and teamwork, even if they had to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blue Reds, who sat at the top of the billboard from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the Vitoria team came out of the perimeter, one could already expect that they had come to the field with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from √Ålava decided to play with Barac on the inside, and to play with Eliyahu, who, when returning to the team, was received with whistles and applause, which is his home, in order to further extend their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of Splitter already meant that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game had not been decided long ago and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorias once again that on their field not everyone wins, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "hand of El√≠as" they came back to play.
Eidson and Pnini played a key role in the rotation of the row by the "yellows" (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a few games with meeting security to get back air and suddenly one of them came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that on the billboard again calming distance of (54-67) was displayed, which the host could decorate with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alaves were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they had honestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not sign up and tried to give their team strength again by three points from the line (70-77).
Despite this, and although splitter was put off because of Fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended themselves well and although the Israelis still recovered in the last minute (80-85), the game had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to resign to him in group B of Euroliga, which was marked by the failure of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially during the internal game, which made victory easier for the Greeks.
The M√°laga team was not afraid of the atmosphere in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter the Andalusians were allowed to dream. An aggressive defense and three successive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts blinded with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the one Unicaja, even though the local team with an indoor game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the billboard in favour of it in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute in which it would have come almost to the mess between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and for which both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and its superiority on both sides of the game, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three errors of Carlos Jim√©nez themselves left clear traces of Unicaja.
Among their players in the field and Lithuanian predecessor Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up hunt was impossible
The third quarter of the game was distinguished by many attacks against the Olympic team, which, despite its 19 losses, were superior and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game played in M√°laga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which, in turn, led to a change in the leadership within the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the many failures and the exit of Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, a little hope for 66-57 came again in the 31st minute thanks to the suspension and triples of Cook and the use of Lewis.
However, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as it attacked and showed its superiority with centimetres within the basket area, was not to be stopped.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be beaten and had to resign the lead atOlympiacos.
How much should you earn on Facebook because of your profile?
Facebook users can now experience their salary thanks to the new Trovit application, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users on the basis of more than 140,000 job vacancies available at Trovit in Spain. Users are provided with a form on Facebook, in which they can enter their profession, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish employee feels "bad paid on average", explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through his search engines in Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros that a Spanishman deserves.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net content of EUR 34,247 in England, EUR 25,751 in France and EUR 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is a waiter with 11.592 euros per year, followed by the work of a salesman with 14.725 euros and the work of a worker with 15.667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in her embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President, who has been removed from office, must leave diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest if his mandate has expired.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV station Globo that "Mel" had to leave the message he had found since September 21st.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, as his mandate expires on that day and he must look for a new place to stay."
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the scheduled date: "My position is, as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the 29 November elections (where Porfirio Lobo won) Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, he tried this week to obtain refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed the Zelayas refusal to recognize the status of an asylum seeker politician, whom the de facto government, under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much!
After the most seductive days since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant mood on the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no way surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure applied to stabilise the markets was to compensate for the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to allow, indirectly, the liquidity to move around zero, so that banks would buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have almost ended and, without calling into question their heterodox liquidity policy, are beginning to spread some sand into circulation, as the ECB has just announced with its annual auction that will take place next week.
That is why investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are now witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in the corporate bonuses rise again, even though they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to state private risks and sovereign debt is rising again.
It is now based on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area with regard to Germany.
Spain has so far been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened to lower with a new revision regarding Spain's rating.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of moral risk who had tried again to create a consciousness among those responsible for world economic policy, for what they had caused, because they had stopped the devastating effects on which the restriction of loans led to the loss of jobs, when they had actually decided on a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power to the Emirates and the development in Greece was predicted earlier.
A government that hides the debt of the state, elections and a new government that draws the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and S√≥crates in Portugal to Dur√£o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin Hungary to save at the beginning of the year from the non-fulfilment of its foreign payments and thus allow a euro-member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account the need for extraordinary measures in order to maintain the stability of state finances.
Yes, we are, as expected, faced with an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some outflows on too high amounts, this would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
If, however, European differences are reduced and Spanishs continue to increase, this would be a particular Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the preferred indicators here force a majority of market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, which are the result of a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long service life despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "Beware of Driving" is called for.
Connected branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio S√°nchez Gal√°n, appeared first yesterday before Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy for the supply of energy in Spain will be debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasega, Gal√°n gave some tips on what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion from this date until 2030, on condition that the current nuclear power stations remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investments needed would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy generation capacity, but rather in distribution networks and international associations.
As of 2020, the question will change and performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it is assumed that 18.000 MW more will be needed, under the pre-requisite of course by other "support energies".
Gal√°n, who believes that the draft law on a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has called for, did not in any case want to say anything against this law, like creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all the policies in the fight against climate change.
In his view, "in the long term, this is clearly the direction, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola described them.
However, Gal√°n believes that decisions on investments should be taken now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable compensation framework is needed to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "action" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for ground airport services, Swiss Port of Switzerland, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have yet been announced, is set at five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcal√° de Henares signed yesterday a protocol on cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the study of energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction involved is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German high-level are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motor vehicle operator.
The city administration wants to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration has decided to co-operate with the public-private sector (PPP is the English abbreviation) in order to advance the project according to a business plan prepared by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll management.
Pending the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly made up of European construction companies, competing in the last phase.
The group named Transcity is headed by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second company is based in Italy, one of the best civil engineering specialists.
The Northern Direct consortium, made up of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure and the French construction group Bouygues, is opposed to the Acciona team.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the local building block (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction work and privatisation, but has a barrier to overcome, as only through the purchase of a local construction company can you get access.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned companies, either high depth or low finger, in addition to Asian references, and which the Spanish construction giants must follow.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market by its 30 % stake in high-level, owner of the above-mentioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona places great importance on this geographical area for the industry, where it is already well known as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry due to its activity.
Among other assets, it already has its large windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that were commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll route, promoted by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and named Northern Link (Northport) has the purpose to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the bypass line in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels, the large measure of dam duzation on the streets of Brisbane.
The roadmap issued by the City Administration foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll line is already to be opened for transport in the last months of 2014, it is assumed that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland participates in the financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For high depth Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia has repeatedly awarded significant contracts to Hochdeep, which signed a contract with the government of 154 million yesterday.
The ACS sub-company, through its local subsidiary Leighton, will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fibre optic cables.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-storey construction project of the King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane, which has not yet begun and has received a depth of 129 million.
In the UK, Manchester, too, it competes with Laing O'Rourke to build and manage two schools for 25 years.
The initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired over its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the contract for the construction work to extend the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunneling.
Construction work is scheduled to begin at the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will last for more than 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives commercial from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the agency Sra. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros per year, the railway company informed.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented sch to this competition announced by Renfe, of which 4 came in the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty of more than 63 million for France T√©l√©com because of the disruption of competition.
France T√©l√©com imposed a penalty of more than EUR 63 million on France‚Äôs competition regulator for anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition for fixed networks and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned companies have raised more than EUR 560 million in penalties since 1994 due to the handicap of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the authority that is waiting for competition believes that France T√©l√©com has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore become redundant again.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading page on the Internet to increase revenue from non-telephone transactions.
In principle, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 for this dish to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought in Madrid and Bar√ßa 476.4 million since the beginning.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has developed into a source of revenue for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since then, bringing them the third and fifth place in the football clubs that earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win UEFA‚Äôs Champions League not only brings glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to EUR 5.362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) participating in this event since its establishment in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The White Club is located in the third place in Europe, which earned the most money through its participation and which, in addition to the AC Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 finished fifth.
The list leads Manchester United and Bavaria Munich, two teams that also received the most money through their participation in the last Champoins League.
And that even though they lost to Bar√ßa.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place among the countries that were able to take money through the champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, unlike four bee Italy, three at England and two at Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated funding procedure used by UEFA.
In this fiscal year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects the Champions League to generate 1,090 million.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying round (including the Atl√©tico de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million by their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). Clubs that have come to the eighth final each receive three million; the four that have come to the quarter final, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Bar√ßa earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are foreseen, are still to be made.
This money is awarded in proportion to the value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 allocated places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third placed and 10% for fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The group Nueva Rumasa last night had details of the purchase offer of shares, with which it intends to acquire a ceiling of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force it to tender for the number of shares (opa).
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1 % per year due to this shift.
Yesterday the Sos shares closed at EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company as 18 % below market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jerez gives the shareholders a 15-day period to share their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV claimed that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the Authority.
In the case of a transaction, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos 254.27 million.
Meanwhile Sos continues to restructure its management.
When trying to stay on the edge of possible offers of purchase and the judicial disputes of his ex-managers, the brothers Jes√∫s and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of Mar√≠a Luisa Jord√° as head of the internal audit.
A decision to become the first woman to hold a high position with the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairmanship of the Group.
This is all other than polemics, because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of redirecting more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the loan of Salazar, the former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and √Ångel Fern√°ndez Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the move of 212 million without knowing their purpose.
CNMV approves the public exclusion notice from Paterina submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion notice for Federico Paterina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The Authority declared that it had approved the tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions were in line with the law and therefore the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted, as amended by the last 2 December, can be considered as "sufficient".
CNMV has also informed that this offer aims to acquire 550.008 shares of Federico Paterina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn represents 8.95 % of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 euros in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
In addition, it has been reported that 5.592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paterina in accordance with the law.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of storms and accidents not only the car workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are taken to the workshops, where an expert must assess the damage caused and the cost of repair.
No single accident is the same and the calculation of costs for parts and hours of work can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and hours of work, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, it is a matter of minutes with the support of the latest computer tools
That is why nearly 100% of the experts use these types of systems.
Service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process it and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with the tool market for reviewing and preparing a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Vel√°zquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are involved, each of which provides the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed will become more and more large, up to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have come on the market than in the last fifteen years.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because each individual of the Aber thousand vehicle parts must be catagolized and his price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
In the case of a much-sold model, the work can be completed within one week if the process is progressing quickly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Audatex has 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain with complete information.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle fleet on the roads, it is more than 99%.
In order to carry out documentation work and to produce databases, Audatex has eight centres (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) distributed worldwide and each of them has specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics professionals) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in the development of these databases.
Each month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers receive the updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and to offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for calculating the default or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When looking at the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get an overview of the kind of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with AudaPlus being the star of the products, a standard solution for handling accidents for the experts.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
It will be the most expensive for customers who rarely use it, to a maximum of 10 times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt on the basis of the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the specialist market on the Internet, with which you can offer for vehicles that have been declared to be total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses, or in obtaining information about deviations by brand and model.
For example, one can examine how many models of a particular car brand had to be in the workshop due to failures or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this kind of computer tools.
It distributes among other Gt estimates, which are also intended for reviewers and provides in the same way digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, failure or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Expert Guide is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its volume of business has increased by 20 % annually over the last three years and in 2008 revenues amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company‚Äôs sources, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total sales in the world of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounted to $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenue of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock market and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Sale of car accidents on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a tablet on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increase, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This evaluation and purchasing service is exclusively for industry professionals, such as insurance companies, consultants, car rental companies, workshops, scrapping sites and car dealers, who must register prior to their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of which alone in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been de-registered may no longer operate on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars of historical value may be re-approved even if they have been notified after difficult administrative procedures.
Workshop cost estimate in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in only four steps:Identification of the vehicle, Search for the spare part, Creation and Creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 land vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by means of the chassis number, a graph of the respective model appears and the required spare part is then selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for hours worked, surcharges or discounts, and thereafter he can print out the cost estimate and pass it on to his customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool to evaluate like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can pay without further delay.
At present, the company Audatex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that automechanics have been waiting for for for a long time, for example, because you can choose a door with it and then turn the image completely to look at the inside.
