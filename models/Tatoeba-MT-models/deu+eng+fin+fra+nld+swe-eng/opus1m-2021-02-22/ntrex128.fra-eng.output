Members of the Assembly of Wales worried about "going for puppets"
Welsh elected officials are confronted with a proposal to replace their title by the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal is the result of the proposed amendment of the name of the Assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, Members of the House believe that this could be the subject of riots.
One Labour Representative said that his group was concerned that the word “rhymes with Twp and Pwp”.
For non-Gallian readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means cross.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Parti du Pays de Galles) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulae.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (marionnette), the distance is close.
In this context, in Welsh, the w letter is pronounced as the u letter in English of the Yorkshire region.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the change of name, said that “the final decision on the name of the members of the Assembly is their responsibility”.
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 empowers the assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as a Welsh Parliament, which was largely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission is pro viding support for Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP) but a large majority of Gallois prefers MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could prove to be a real breakthrough for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a bill on the change of name in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include other amendments to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the name issue during discussions on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on changing the name of the country
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be named “the Republic of Northern Macedonia”.
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a dispute of several decades between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a very long time, Athens has insisted that Macedonia's name is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly called for the accession of its neighbouring country to the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said that he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem : churches in difficulty, bells of Saint Martin reduced to silence
"The elderly people I discussed with say that traditionally there was a bar and a church at every corner of the street," says Mr. Adams.
"There is no longer at all today."
According to him, it's normal for the bars to get tough.
Today, "we don't get used to the same way anymore," he explains.
"In the past, we went to the bar as we did to his neighbor, but that is no longer the case."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted well before what the officials imagine, and he is concerned about this: " sooner or later, they will return to the departure box".
He added that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who would not help maintain the last sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will largely be white people who will precipitate the closure of all churches, because it is unlikely that they will become members," he is concerned.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The original White Methodist congregation abandoned the site in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation, preaching nearby, took possession of the building.
St. Martin's church was taken over by a black community under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the 125th Street boutiques, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which the Blacks tried to get used or promoted.
In 1939 a fire ravaged the building, but the parishioners of Father Johnson prepared to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
That Father Johnson's son and successor to the Church of St. Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the bells of poor people.
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave him a completely different name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentioned that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the larger carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr Merriweather said that Saint Martin had not replaced him.
In recent months, much has been said about the housekeeping of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the secular elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body made up of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that it wished to impose the costs incurred, even if it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners deplored the diocesan's lack of transparency.
California: a 13-year-old boy injured by shark during a lobster fishery
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old last Saturday while fishing lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego's television channel, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting with help and started paging up to him to get out of the water.
In the first place, Chad thought that the young boy was pushing screams of joy to have had a catch, and then he realized that in reality he
had been bitten.
On arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the keyboard.
"I screamed for everyone to get out of the water: There's a shark!" explains Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in a critical state.
The shark species that caused the attack is unknown.
During a press conference, the rescue chief Larry Giles informed that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torch.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the British aesthetics market
Sainsbury's hands down on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and garnishes them with rays similar to those of supermarkets, full of aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by field specialists.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK aesthetics market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while the sales of fashion and home items are falling, more extensive beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves to be conclusive.
The supermarkets are investing in the beauty market today with the aim of reusing the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also revives its boutique makeup line to offer a majority of untested products on animals, an ever more important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume seller will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first one opened last week in Croydon, in the south of London, and a second one scheduled to open in the course of the year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to step up their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly inclined to make their online purchases and move to local shops for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, Director General of Sainsbury's, said that points of sale will increasingly look like large areas, as the supermarket chain is trying to counter Aldi and Lidl discount stores by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has established Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the two chains were purchased two years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed the sales of current consumer goods to be driven forward and the acquisitions to be profitable.
The previous attempts to restructure the pharmaceutical and cosmetic products of the British chain had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tried a partnership with Boots, but ended with a polemic concerning the distribution of profits from pharmacies located in supermarkets.
After three years of selling his 281 pharmacies for £125 million in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been changed to improve the customer environment.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can provide helpful advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet any need and, thanks to the embellishment of our rays and the ideal situation of our institutions, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now indisputable and changes purchasing habits," added Mills-Hicks.
Anger by Peter Jones after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal of an agreement of £11 million
Couroux of the star of the television program Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of the host Holly Willoughby from a £11 million contract related to his home decoration brand, to devote himself to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to take care of the interior decoration and accessories brand True.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
37 years old, this morning's host announced on Instagram that she would withdraw.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, furious by withdrawing from their successful textile and interior decoration activity in the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the dear child on TV revealed, at a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of the commercial empire of Dragon's Den star in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, worth £1.5 million, no longer allowed him to look after Truly, their brand of interior decoration and accessories.
The brand Truly was assimilated to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the host's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped into his private jet to join one of his secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities
and is in the process of ensuring its future for the next 2 decades.
Its decision left everyone without a voice.
Nobody could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
The Marlow headquarters is filled with ready-to-sell products."
Specialists believe that the departure of this morning's host, one of Britain's most "bankable" celebrities, could cause millions to be lost to society, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to clothing or interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
Moreover, this could put an end to long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, were friends close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52 years old, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
Couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones held 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and take the place of Ant McPartlin as the host of the I'm A Celebrity program of ITV.
A source near Jones said last night that he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was silly, but we finally love each other.
Trump made fun of the media that criticized him because of his comment that some people consider "a president's insignia," and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?"
he's been rocking, taking a voice as a TV journalist.
"I have not given up anything at all."
He indicated that Kim Jong-un had been in favour of holding a second meeting, after Trump qualified the first meeting, which took place in Singapore in June, as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on this denuclearisation are at a dead end.
More than 3 months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's head of diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, said on Saturday to world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the United States did not see a corresponding “response” to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his conference speech Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"It's all right with North Korea," says North American President.
We fought the armed conflict.
“ Millions of people were reportedly killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim resulted in positive results: the end of the missile fire tests, the release of hostages and the remains of North American soldiers returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get to this arena full of crackers, there's barely 200 standing in front of me," he criticized by pointing a finger to the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastating island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, the assistance of foreign NGOs was probably not necessary.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been scattered, but no national disaster has been decreed, a condition required to trigger international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it clear many times that they did not want international aid, which makes things a bit more complicated," said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children set up a team to go to Palu, she still does not know if work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite its constant shocks, the country is cruelly lacking the means to protect itself from the cavities of nature.
Refuges have been built in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no siren of alarms was heard in Palu, which may have contributed to human losses.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters make the use of transport more difficult.
A hospital ship that had been posted in Lombok to treat the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the new scene of the disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, placed the infrastructure reform delapped at the centre of his electoral campaign and spent considerable sums to restore roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has undermined Mr. Joko's government, which will be represented in front of the voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practise their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven out of their homes, on the basis of clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: The attacker of Liverpool Daniel Sturridge manages to equalize against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a defeat in Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea, marking the 89th minute, Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 metres from the Chelsea goals, and his team was run from 1 to 0.
He shot the balloon on his left, before escaping a shot at the second pole.
The balloon flew above the repair surface before heading towards the top right corner of the net.
The bullet ended up reaching Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended its road at the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to sit down, grab a ball, but players like Shaq always pull as far away as possible, so I tried to save as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante was approaching to control and without really much thought I decided to shoot."
Chelsea led 1 to 0 in mid-time after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard at the 25th minute.
The attacker of the Blues took a pass towards Mateo Kovavic, before moving to the middle of the field and sprint side of Liverpool.
Kovavic realized a quick go-and-come in the middle of the field,
Then made a beautiful deep shooting that threatened Hazard in the surface.
Hazard pushed the defense and finished his race in the second pole net, with a left foot shot behind the Liverpool porter, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitans in the phase of groups of the League of Champions, Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: the number of victims of the tsunami is 832
The Disaster Management Agency reported on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami record reported 832 deaths.
Many residents are stuck under the debris of the buildings destroyed by the earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5, which shook the country on Friday and triggered waves of 6 metres high, informed the spokesman of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
With more than 380 000 inhabitants, the town of Palu was covered with debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of having stabbed a woman
An investigation for murder was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 0755 hours, a 44-year-old woman with knife strokes was discovered in John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge the inhabitants of the neighborhood who would have seen or heard something to testify to.
The police captain, Brian O'Hagan, made the following statements: "The investigation just started, but I would like to ask anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who would have seen or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
In particular, I call on taxi drivers, who could have caught something on their Dashcam and asked them to provide us with all the crucial information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property in which she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman presented themselves at the crime scene and asked questions about where she was found.
The investigation is ongoing and the police reported that they were informing relatives near the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him without a voice.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
One police officer said that the whole sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene,
Repeating: "It's too horrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were placed inside the cord, and another outside.
Several officers were watching the building on the inside side of the cord.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101, or to contact the organization anonymously.
Parliament: Cromwell's statue, last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the right return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, countless religious and cultural property of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as fanatic Talibans.
However, the Cromwell Society found Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and described it as a "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that, "In view of the current debate around the withdrawal of statues, it was obvious that the one by Oliver Cromwell erected in front of the Westminster Palace was not going to be spared.
Cromwell has neither ordered nor led the conoclasm during the British Civil Wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, bears witness to the consideration given to him in the 19th century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith said the following to the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a advocate of parliament against external pressures, I mean monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is precise or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the future development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognisable figure that represents one side of the fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be emphasized and commemorated."
China: a pig kills a breeder
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeastern market in China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery cut and covered with blood near a marketplace in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs in a pig porchery, May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin since the surrounding province of Yunnan on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door in the nearby patio was open.
He claims that there was a huge male pig inside and that blood flowed from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg mutilated the herd to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the breeder's cousin, said that "his legs were crushed and covered with blood."
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan coming to the market at 04.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death was not owned by the farmer or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the animal was locked in order to avoid any other incidents and allow police to collect evidence.
The family of Mr. Yuan and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, attacks of pigs against individuals have already been reported.
In 2016 on a Massachusetts farm, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously hurting her.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg stuck a Welsh breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to get away from it.
In 2012, while an Oregon breeder had just been devoured by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that this is not, in principle, an aggressive animal, but that the taste of the blood can cause this kind of behavior.
"They're more like gamers,
very curious kids... they have no intention of doing harm.
Just show them the respect they need," he assures.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane are expected to cause heavy precipitation in the southeastern United States
According to forecasts, the Rosa hurricane is weakened as it moves above the colder waters of the north-eastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause rains in northeastern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Winds had been at 135 km/h (category 1) hurricane since 5 a.m., eastern Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane should move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is beginning to develop above the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastwards towards the west coast of the United States. As it approaches Monday the Lower California Peninsula in the form of a storm, the Rosa hurricane will result in intense tropical humidity northwards in the southwestern United States.
It will rain up to 25 cm in regions of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the southwest over the next few days.
At the local level, precipitations of between 2.5 and 10 cm will result in sudden dangerous floods, debris spills and potential landslides in the desert.
The vents will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in locations, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in southwestern regions, in particular a large part of Arizona.
Drained tropical rains are likely to cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly advised not to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical precipitation.
Intense rains could convert canyons into drained rivers and storms would produce windfalls and dust whirlwinds in locations.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rains in some southern parts of the country, on the Californian coast.
The totals of rainfall can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flows and make the shoe sliding.
These could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
A scattered tropical rainstorm will reach Arizona Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, and will then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rainfall will befall all over the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Important changes in temperature are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the freshness of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
This sometimes causes a radical change in time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will suffer considerable temperature variations on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
A large part of the center and east of the United States is expected to experience a warm month of October, with temperatures turning around 26 degrees Celsius covering the plains of the south and other north-east regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
Multiple-day forecasts indicate that temperatures should be above average in the eastern United States during the first fifteen months of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Transmitted on 6 TV channels Thursday, the striking hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of having sexually assaulted her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political stalemate persists, the broadcasting services interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a blow to the theatre: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured herself 100% that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had performed torturing her person and had tried to remove her clothes during an evening between high school.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate draw, said that it was also 100% certain that it had never happened.
According to Nielsen's report, the trial is likely to have reached an audience of over 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures for other channels, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Furthermore, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV in the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football match or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose facilitators largely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most watched channel during the hearing day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with a hearing reaching the 3.26 million.
Following CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
Interest did not fail once the hearing was completed.
Flake was in the middle of the drama that was playing on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN's and CBS' cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was taken part by protesters while attempting to take the elevator to the court hearing.
Flake lay her eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of the live inquiry.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," launches one of the women.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are deprived."
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and that it would do more at the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast network channels covered the meeting live a few hours later, while the Judicial Commission was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh throughout the Senate.
Flake, however, indicated that a week's investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on the accusations made against the candidate, as the minority democrats demanded.
Flake was partly persuaded by talking to his friend, Senator Democratic Chris Coons.
He took his decision after having met with Coons and several other senators later.
His choice was heavy in the balance, as Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's appointment without a prior inquiry.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault charges.
Great Britain: May accuses opponents of Brexit of doing "small policy"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project to leave the European Union, to make "small policy" at the expense of the future of Britain and the national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photograph of Theresa May on cover, his former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "purely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police stop Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the death of LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU sneaker.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, was shot and charged with second-degree murder, reported the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities posted a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
The glasses were found at the scene of the crime and carried Simpson's DNA, according to the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police to be responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the office of the Baton-Rouge parish medical examiner published a preliminary report that determined that death was caused by a bullet that crossed the head and settled in the neck.
The Police Department recognizes the assistance received by the Fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the State Police Medical Laboratory, the Southern University Police, and citizens in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the law enforcement for their "engagement and quest for justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, it scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game during the last season.
Friday morning, Will Wade, the LSU basketball coach said that the team was "damaged and shocked" after the news of Wayde's death.
"We're always afraid of this kind of event," said Wade.
Mexico: a volcano cracking ashes
From the ash escape from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Reduction Centre recommended Mexicans to move away from the volcano, having recorded a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The centre monitored several earthquakes and tremors from the Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed fine layers of ash covering car windshields in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 shook the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: Police-Separatist clashes on the anniversary of the vote for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and the riot police, while thousands of opponents joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being returned by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder into them, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not disperse tourists.
Heating also broke out later in the day, while the police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence that were scandalizing "neither forgotten nor forgiven", faced unionist supporters shouting "long life in Spain".
14 protesters who had minor injuries were treated, according to the local press.
One year after the referendum on 1 October, judged illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain strong in the independent region.
A overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low participation rate, with the opponents of secession largely boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped the night of Friday to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
It was still there, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the Separatist demonstration, said that he no longer had any hope of Catalonia's independence.
"We witnessed a great time last year.
My parents were crying out for the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in a deadlock," he regrets.
Despite their capital victory, however, in the regional elections last December, the independent Catalan parties had difficulty maintaining momentum this year, many popular leaders being exiled or detained waiting to be judged for having organized the referendum and declared Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, 42-year-old mechanic, filming the police support demonstration on his phone, found politicians responsible for blocking the situation, both on the one hand and on the other.
"The tension is only rising," he regrets.
On Saturday, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison awaiting a ruling since last year, Oriol Junqueras announced his intention to apply for the European Parliament elections next year.
"For me, it is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government," he adds.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men impact a house by car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after having fallen several times over a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Police captain Bob Blemmings reported that the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would also have received arrow shots.
Livingston wins the game 1 to 0 against the Rangers with Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal ensures Livingston's victory
The Livingston team recently won the Rangers in 18 games with a second win at Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to be placed in second position in the ranking, in the same way as Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside this season's Premiership league, and have to face the Hearts team on Sunday, which leads 8 points.
But before that, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europa League this Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, she has been extending her unsuspected career in the division by six games, and her senior coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, can blame herself for not losing the least match yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity faced with embroidered opponents
Holt's team could have taken the lead well before marking it, as their direct approach made the Rangers difficult.
Scott Robinson tried to break through but remained trapped in front of the opposing goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team allowed the Rangers to own the ball, knowing that they could be embarrassed by working tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came into being.
The Rangers gave a free blow and the Livingston tried an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined forces to tangle Menga, who took a touch and set a goal in the middle of the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but found themselves faced with an impenetrable defense and the Liam Kelly goaltender was rarely worried.
The second half had the same rhythm, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
The Rangers Guard Allan McGregor stopped a hit by Scott Pittman from the foot, while Lithgow managed to defeat one of the Livingston plans.
Livingston's guard repelled all attempts and protected his cage, while two penaltyys were denied by the arbitrator, one for the provocation of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a fault of hand.
Livingston's « phenomenon» - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and composition of the team have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the merit goes to Holt for having since his arrival motivated a team.
which has many great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was grand and beautifully organized, and Menga managed to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in hold throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level reached with Gerrard, they did not match their past talent.
They missed a final opportunity and only managed to break through the opposite side once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of a tableau.
Mixed reception of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues have been raised, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Speaking of security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from meeting in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him to his country.
The cleavage that emerges from the protests reflects Erdogan's double vision: a visitor welcomed by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as an autocrat by others.
Accident from the road to Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10:15 local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescue arrived on site, but the man died on the scene of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place Saturday. The car driver had escaped.
The London police said that the officers were doing everything they could to identify the individual and prevent his or her loved ones.
Roads have been closed and bus detours have been put in place. Motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured in a riot
The head of the High Security Men's Prison stated that six prison officers had been injured in a riot.
The riot started in the HMP Long Lartin Prison, located in Worcestershire, around 09:30 local time this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Specialised anti-sluggish officers were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On site, the officers were treated for minor face injuries.
A spokesman for the prison management said: "Specially trained personnel were deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six agents were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. Those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and will be able to see their prolonged sentences."
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered the country's most dangerous, are imprisoned in the HM Long Lartin Prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot officers were sent to the prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners attacked the personnel with pool balls.
Ouragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden floods (which could be beneficial for areas affected by drought)
It is rare for tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week. Rosa hurricane is heading towards the southwest desert with what remains of energy. This area could be affected by sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued floods alerts for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, on Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa should head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain announcements as early as Monday evening.
Phoenix-based national weather service stated in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the tropical depression or storm stage within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stopped 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center are 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm in places in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rocky Zone and the Great Basin, are expected to record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measurements up to 10 cm.
The Rosa rains could be salvaging for areas affected by drought that are not exposed to the risk of sudden flood.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rain could be beneficial for the southwestern region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, just over 40% of Arizona had at least one extreme drought, the second most serious one," reports weather.com.
The Rosa hurricane begins its path on the coasts on the Lower California Peninsula.
Still with great power on Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and lead to flooding.
"A total of between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico to the north, with the power of a tropical storm, and will reach the Arizona border on Tuesday, early in the morning, as tropical depression. It will cross Arizona and the south of Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
"Rural rains are expected in Lower California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert and constitute the main danger," explained the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially fatal sudden floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted homicide, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 4 a.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital, and his condition is now stable.
The Avon and Sommerset police reported that they arrested the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20) at night on the side of Radstock.
Officers called people who might have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump states that Kavanaugh was the victim of the wickedness and anger of the Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a gathering in Wheeling in Western Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh was the victim of the wickedness and anger of the Democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress on Thursday, rejecting with energy and emotion Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she was sexually assaulted several decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" today.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in the public service," he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in Western Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he referred to the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting on all fronts for great candidates."
Trump stated that the Democrats were in charge of "resistance and obstruction".
The first decisive procedural vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, according to the statement of a Republican Party employee in CNN.
Indonesia: an earthquake and a tsunami make hundreds of victims, the record continues to grow
On Saturday, the authorities stated that at least 384 people had died, most of them carried by huge waves that fell on the beaches, while an earthquake followed by a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Celebs.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves of six metres above sea level submerged the beach at nightfall. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their way.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake preceded the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People didn't run away immediately, it cost them their lives," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (NPBA) at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't happen alone. He drove cars, pieces of wood, houses, he took everything with him," Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved in the sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing the trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 palu centres.
The aerial images published by the Disaster Management Agency show destroyed buildings and stores, distorted and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geographic location of the city, which would have had a long narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Body was found trapped under debris of ruins, he added, indicating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho stated that human and material losses could be greater on the 300 km coast north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the earthquake epicentre.
The communications were "fully paralyzed" since Dongglala, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," said La Croix Rouge in a press release, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could get worse," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not disseminating the information that a tsunami had touched Palu, although agents stated that waves had arrived the time for the alert to be published.
An amateur video shared on social networks shows a man on the floor of a building shouting frenetically to passersby in the street as a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall sat down on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power failure that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to transport aid by cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated people always need much food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened as part of the relief operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesia: There are more than 800 deaths in the assessment of the victims of the tsunami.
It's a tragedy.
The Dongglaa World Vision staff arrived healthy and out of Palu, where they found shelter in shelters established in the courtyard of their offices. On the way, they discovered the scene of the devastation, explains Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When relief groups began to provide relief to the disaster victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
"This disaster is always considered a regional one," explains Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and Friday tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing persons were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
Sunday, the rescuers released a woman buried under the debris for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students found themselves trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, added Mr. Mandagi.
"As an elder in paragliding discipline, I have experienced my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon said that he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
His messages remained unanswered.
"I think they never received my messages."
At Newport on the Levee, thieves subtly charge $26,750 when loading an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 to a Brink's agent who reloaded an automatic distributor in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The vehicle driver drained a distributor in the entertainment complex and prepared to feed it," said Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leave the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information about their identities is requested to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
Kanye West rapper is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Forefather known as Kanye West."
41-year-old West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album, Yanghi.
Its participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled his arrival for "emotional reasons," explained the program creator.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional pseudonym, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
"I think "Ye" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you," West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us.
I have passed from Kanye, which means "the only one," to Ye - the reflection of the good, the evil, the confusion, and everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West in the past, has also played on the feature of union and the majors.
In Mexico, AMLO states that it will never resort to military force against civilians.
The Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloody reprisals of the law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco's square that he would "never use military force to punish the Mexican people."
On 2 October 1968, the troops opened fire at a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the area of artificial intelligence
As China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding dedicated to research in this sector, according to the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several US government actors have made announcements about AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in innovation IA by 2030.
"double funding for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries have a lead on the US, and we're looking for the next big IA discovery," Lee says.
Double funds could double the chances that the next key step in AI will come from the United States," said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sanovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an AI system that beat American Othello's best ranking player. He then integrated the management team of Microsoft Reasearch and became president of the Chinese Google industry.
Lee has already participated in technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when would the next competition take place, in order to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, U.S. researchers often have to work hard to obtain government funding.
"It's not China that owns university leaders, it's companies," Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited major university names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes in immigration policies could also support the efforts of the United States in AI.
"I think green cards should be granted automatically to researchers in IA," he says.
The China Council of State Affairs unveiled its new generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which should involve partners from industry and academia. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, for its part, currently invests more than $100 million a year for research in AI.
At the same time, the American legislation that works to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voices heard in a referendum on the change of the name of their country for the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right on its territory and has opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents claim that change would affect the ethical identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote during the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts as to whether a minimum of 50% would be required to validate the referendum.
The referendum question was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to the supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which were destroyed by the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, which means a safer life for each of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of the parliament said they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But participation was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 that had mobilized 66% of voters at the end of the vote.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted in favour of the change of name, in order to open the vote for NATO and EU membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In the parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who boycott the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will enable Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments.
"I think a large majority will be favourable, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr Zaev after filing his newsletter.
He added that a "yes" would be a "affirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian Telma chain, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of the participants intending to vote said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, 50 per cent of the votes plus one vote are required.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office last May.
Key Action: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, runs a path through Brighton’s defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 match on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
The goal of Aguero, at 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine scorer received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before diving on the ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed a defender before evading others near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the balloon to Sterling, on his left.
The English front took advantage of it to send the balloon back to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton's guard, Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, the team coach, to journalists.
"We said he'd be playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have marked him at that time."
But Sterling had given the initial advantage to the Skyblues during the Premier League match,
from the 29th minute.
Aguero received the balloon directly on Brighton's field.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few keys before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before sliding outside the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play party troubles against the Rockies
As the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to start in a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of an elimination match for the Rockies, real legends facing the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West League Division.
The Rockies took it 5-2 in front of the Nationals Friday night, but they are always trying to secure their first division title.
"Even if this game doesn't have a stake, we want to climb the field in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level I'll have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce a launcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave the room in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be in training Thursday and will launch on his usual day of rest, Sunday.
Washington's right-hand side is at 18-7 with an average of 2.53 points and 300 withdrawals over 220 steps and two thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in Western Virginia
The President referred to the situation in which his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court was generated by the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is a major issue. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I fight on all fronts for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued "You see this horrific, really horrific radical group of democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to take over power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats are in charge of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it on the last four days," he added, before calling the democrats "wrong, wicked and lying."
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was the best way for him to be heard by the public.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you release the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it was.
It is not tolerant to those who express their ideas
When momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians from the Labour Party considered not to be welcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I am concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday said: "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
That's exactly what the general assemblies of Friday night during my eight years as a Labour Party parliamentarian were.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many gatherings and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if it has never been taken into account.
It became clear that the opposite views were no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion was judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party leaders.
It began shortly after Jeremy took over, and colleagues with whom I thought I had shared the same political vision began to wait for me to return to my jacket and take positions against my convictions, whether it concerns national security or the EU internal market.
Whenever I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an undue draw on social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were made to me were of a political nature.
I am admiring the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a glimmer of genderist or racist speech every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most disappointing things about current politics is the normalization of the various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this great community and that the party is restricted through defiance motions and changes to the selection rules.
I have been given a lot of advice in the last two years: to lower my eyes, not to express my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But it is not to act as I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a booster, because the negligence of thatcher government had caused my classroom to collapse. Since then, I have been eager to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East was able to be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with the party's current leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion Friday is that the country is going to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I think it's not really time to lose time and energy by discussing my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether they are workers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the reasons I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is Parliamentary for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr remains unsuspected
Two late trials may have faked the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense game day of the Scotland Rugby Championship at XV.
The team now ranks high and becomes the only unconvinced team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defence and the way in which they are seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can welcome this match.
"Until now, we have been tested, but we remain inconceivable, so I must be happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, congratulated Ayr: "Good to them, they have been more effective than us and have been able to grasp the opportunities."
The trial of Grant Anderson, at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in good position, but a yellow cardboard for the Scottish Wing Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers. Jason Baggot took an untransformed trial.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in mid-time. It scored and transformed a solo test to climb the score to 17-5 for Ayr on break.
Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
It followed a long wait for it because of a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a civière. During the recovery, Ayr took the lead with a test of Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow cardboard and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an untransformed attempt by Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the home team recovered in their hands and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow cardboard for tagging Climo while he didn't have the balloon, from the touch of the penalty, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's mouth, which was progressing.
Climo has transformed the trial, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kick box and sent the winger Gregor Henry far for the fifth trial of the home team.
The star of Still Game starts in the restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in the restaurant. The actor was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old incarnate Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, which he writes and co-hosts with his long-time partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series coming will be the final of the show. And Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is director of Abetriebsmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to become involved in the "flowering environment of restoration" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol an armoured boat in the La Paz naval headquarters.
The public buildings have a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazonia, the naval bases show the following motorcycle: "The sea returns from our right.
"Recovery is a duty."
Throughout the blocked Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a conflict of bloody resources in the 19th century is always well present, just like the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice, which will be issued on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course awaits a positive outcome," explains Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will vote in favour of Bolivia's request. Bolivia hopes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate a sovereign ocean crossing agreement in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for the re-election next year), also has a lot to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think that there is little chance that the court will vote in favour of Chile, and that little will change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands does not have the authority to grant a territory in Chile, and stated that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case was “not complicated”, explains Paz Zárate, an expert Chilean in international law.
And far from favouring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may even have hurt him.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined all the good Chilean will that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange views, but after that it will be very complicated to hold talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and "a chance to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - which to date remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
" Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we have to get rid of the past."
North Korea asserts that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can build confidence in the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that his country would not end up with nuclear weapons until he trusted Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when the Secretary of State of the United States Mike Pompeo seems to be about to revive nuclear diplomacy in the deadlock more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri states that it is "chemical" to think that maintaining sanctions and the US opposition to a statement that will put an end to Korea's war will turn the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of any significant prior disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's seriousness with regard to the waiver of an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month, in order to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the latest trends in head cover, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun at 100%, don't look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their oversized collection of delectable hats at a PE19 show that was a tribute to the Paris Fashion Week style.
All the more extravagant hats than the others invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their crazy pieces into the parades.
Valentino's flagship room was an eccentric beige hat decorated with a broad edge reminiscent of a pen, which swallowed up the mannequins' head.
The other oversized accessories included pasteks of jewelry, a witch hat and even an pineapple. But these pieces were not imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had sewn lips and evoked Hannibal Lecter more than Upper Couture.
One creation looked like a diving equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another was thinking of a melted ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
According to style observers, imposing hats could come to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the sillage of the "Bomba", the straw hat on wide board that the stars are pulling, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hard-to-hand hat that flooded social networks presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the swimsuit model that carried it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, decorated with rafia fringes and a white leather handle, was the master piece of the PE19 La Riviera de Jacquemus show at the Fashion Week in Paris.
The celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in the shops for next summer. The creator has so marked the minds that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the people of the world
The independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent review results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are working to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools are working to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and to replace them as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart."
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and a relationship of trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the excellent results at this year's exams, it is noted that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade, A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of the students obtained the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Languages as subjects are now organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that among the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates, 17% are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of career choices, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this long-term competence.
Power to communicate directly with foreigners automatically places the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not have sufficient foreign language to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
That is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will be better able to find rewarding employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on conventional contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important to the United Kingdom for 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's preference, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialized staff.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need for their success, regardless of what the future holds for them.
It is clear that languages in a world-wide trading environment are still of vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be regarded as "competences of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with Lakers Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are watching LeBron James's beginnings at the Lakers in Los Angeles.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James would play Sunday, in pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll be playing yet.
"More than one, less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers site.
The Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked for his pre-season program projects, which included six games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready."
Trump Campaign in Western Virginia ( YouTube channel)
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stops, including in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
As the election confirmed the vacancy at the Supreme Court was postponed, Trump sought support for the upcoming mid-term elections and avoided the Republicans losing control of Congress during the November vote.
At what time is the Trump meeting in Western Virginia taking place tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling meeting in Western Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. (East time) this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the issue of candidates' hearings in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed to one week during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help Republicans gain ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American President stated in his campaign that the five meetings were intended to "encourage volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congress control is such an essential element of the President's programme that he will be visiting as many states as possible at the start of the responsible election campaign," said Reuters, a spokesman for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media."
On Saturday, it will be the second visit in a month of Trump in Western Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the Western Virginia Senate, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come here to try to revive him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political science specialist at West Virginia University, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hope on the approach of Sunday's singles
After three simples, the ovens of Saturday afternoon could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The swing movement of the momentum is a sporty concept invented by all plays but in which the players sincerely believe, and more than ever at tournaments such as this one.
So where would they find the momentum now?
"They were six points ahead and now four, so it gives us some wings," said Jordan Spieth as he left for the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of playing with four points of advance and twelve others.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having a bit of a doll wind and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and can blame themselves for having won each three out of four points.
Spieth proved to be terribly effective from tea to green and gives the example.
The screams of energetic joy intensified as his game advanced. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize in the fourth part while Thomas and he were led down two after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game in the 15th hole, aroused a similar cry, from those who tell you that he still believes the American team in lice.
"We really need to stay determined and focus on our game," Spieth said.
That's all there is to each of these players now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as evidenced by the history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely European pair won four games out of four and is not entitled to the mistake.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones who didn't realize a bugey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped there Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and during the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate among them and the crowds deluding in it call them the players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to whom to delight a potential European victory while the sun lies on the National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time at different holes.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, hero of the morning football team, while teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bugey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one is here to help you.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and those they don't give, and the way a strategy can turn into a blink of the eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made a considerable advance during the last day, but this session of antsomas has also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, some of which doubted, especially in the country.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 on the United States during the matches and forks of Saturday.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead with two victories on a Tiger Woods in distress, allowing them to score four points so far.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn made a difference in the fact that it lost its title two years ago in Hazeltine, with 3-1 in the morning forks, faced with an disordered American team.
The U.S. showed greater resistance in the furnaces and won two victories, but they failed to remove the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must pick up eight points on the 12th Sunday during the simples to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to pick up four points in a row, while Mollinari and him, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a chilly weekend, are only the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to get four points at their first four matches.
After crashing Woods and Patrick Reed during the four-balls, they beat flat-seated the pair composed of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by a 5 and a 4 even more categoric.
Woods, who took off during the two matches on Saturday, broke a few times, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in an oven and an oven, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, well-rested for the morning ovens, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the ovens, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively numbers one and three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared at the tournament that took place in the south-west of Paris, during a time of fresh weather.
The three winning Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas have established the reference for the Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, who lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a gap of four points in simples, although the Furyk team, who held the crown, had nothing more than to do to keep its trophy.
After having been second for two days, however, they might not recover from a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea states that disarmament will in no case be unilateral without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions would strengthen his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
At the World Organization's Annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had taken “important measures of goodwill” last year, such as putting an end to nuclear tests and missiles, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he regretted.
In the absence of trust in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to unarm ourselves unilaterally."
While reiterating North Korea's well-known accusations of Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made in Singapore on June 12 at the very first summit between a US President and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed to working for a "corean peninsula denuclearization" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean war (1950-1953), but the United States stated that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused requests to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea first pursue denuclearization and increase pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing "the declaration of end of war".
"Those who believe that these sanctions can make us plead do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our distrust."
There was no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted in front of the United Nations by the American leader earlier this week.
Rather, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: "If the part concerned by the denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a deadlock."
In spite of everything, the tone of the Ri speech was radically different from last year, when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles on North American territory after the “malefic” President Trump qualified Kim as “missile man” as suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened last year in front of the United Nations to "extremely destroy" North Korea, did not praise this year's courage with which Kim applied disarmament measures, but added that much remains to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday Trump stated that no time limit had been set. "It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn't matter," he said.
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council last Thursday that "the application of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until the complete, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already travelled to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang, claiming that progress had been made, but within hours North Korea denounced its "gangster methods".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to South Korean President Kim demands the security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest classes
This year, Harvard University has put in place a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fight against the growing machinist tendency of studying eating caffeine all night long.
One professor noted that most students in the world's best university don't know how to take care of them
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is according to him the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a conference on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him
At the end, a student approached me and said, "Why are they telling me only in the last year?"
She said that no one ever talked to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
Published for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their well-being in general.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of the university's health services, stated that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that the students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of various interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing various objects (coffee cups, curtains, basketball, books...) on which students click to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how the lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change students' behaviour instantly.
However, in our view, they have the right to know this information - in the same way as you have the right to know what the health effects of smoking are," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride in " spending a white night" still exists, and he adds that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students make sleeping a growing problem.
Having enough sleep and good quality should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because the lack of sleep puts the brain in a mode of inanition, making them permanently hungry.
Raymond So, a Californian student in chemistry and physical biology aged 19, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year in Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and forced him to insist that he be offered at all campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to propose to all undergraduate students to follow a similar curriculum before joining the recognized institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students predict an alarm for both bedtime and wake-up hours, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Menga's goal makes Gerrard's men fall
The Rangers suffered another hard blow outside, as Dolly Menga's attack led the disjointed team from Steven Gerrard to Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's team had hoped to record its first win on the move since its 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team to the chase, eight points behind the Hearts, leader of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers are now sixth, Livingston is third, just behind Hibernian on the difference in goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, as Arbitrator Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury following the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which scored Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, chose the same Livi 11 who pulled a point at the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see that his well-trained team was suffocating his opponents every turn.
The Rangers may have controlled the possession of the balloon, but Livingston has done more.
They should have scored at two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on the goal of Allan McGregor, but the middle of the field left his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a powerful shot towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his team-mate, defenceman Alan Lithgow, could only reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he should have benefited from a penalty after the free blow when Steven Lawless and he came into a collision but Umpire Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers took advantage of only two shots in the first period, but the former guard of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a strike by Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute registered against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed against Jacobs' arrest.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball back to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool blood to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard responded in mid-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost almost had an immediate impact when the winger appeared in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly hurryed to block it.
Livingston has nevertheless continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett swinging long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the advantage in the last few moments, but McGregor did well to kick Jacobs off before Lithgow passed the goal.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was in contact with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page of our Almanach "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNE COMPTEUR... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm " Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention which subsequently gave birth to the device known as the Geiger meter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unprobable scientists:
A man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, we use it to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
Through these listeners, one can really hear the effects of the atoms released into the minerals by radioactivity."
Evans: "Say, it's sure it's jumping, there!"
" Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells and kill them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognise cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them to a laboratory
They can then "detect" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose goal is to learn to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can detect HER2 protein in common with many cancers, and finally re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 "induced a number of types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, involving taking immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has been proven in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
With a MAGA helmet, Kanye West started in a Pro-Trump diatribe after moving to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West got hooveded on the stage after a goofy performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump on a Saturday Night Live and announced he was going to be in the elections in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he sang by wearing a Make America Great Again helmet, West took over from the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL program started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star is mocking Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although he was not broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by actor Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind him because of his helmet.
"They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that cap on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And after they say I'm in a gouffer," he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see him, the gouffer?" and said he would wear his superman cape, because no one can dictate his actions to him. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted at least twice from the public, and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, says Variety. One person on the spot told the magazine: "A death silence fell on the whole plateau."
West had been called to replace the last minute singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West disarranged a lot of people by singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of the leader of the Conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: MERCI TO KNOW WHAT TO DO."
But Karen Hunter, the host of the show, tweeted that West was simply "true to himself, and it's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward anyone (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out a negative ideology for my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the traces of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the legendary Prince fire, which changed his name to a symbol, and then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: attempted murder charge after a white-armed assault in a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to the police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Trial Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes over the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its fine blade role, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, the violent medieval series of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor took on the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that this kind of role on the screen often leads young boys to get passed for hard cooking to be respected.
In an interview given to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he said something is wrong and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, covedette of Game of Thrones, also 31 years old, admitted that he was " firm" in addressing this issue.
" personally, I think deeply that we have misguided masculinity."
"What lessons have we given to young men who become adults, compared to the problem that now arises?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: "What behaviour is inborn, what behaviour was instilled?
What does television and street teach young boys to think they must behave like this to be a man?
I think this is really one of the fundamental issues of our time - how can we change this?
Obviously, there's something wrong."
In the interview, he also confessed that he would not do prologues or follow-ups when the series will end next summer, claiming to have ended with "the battlefields and horses".
From November onwards, Kit will be the star of a replay by True West, by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the encounter with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that came to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life now," he says.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in Leslie's family estate.
HIV/Sida: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China reported an increase of 14 per cent in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the sick have been infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some parts of the country due to contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was almost zero, claimed the Chinese health authorities at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, the transmission of HIV by sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was degenerate in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies suggest that 70 to 90 per cent of homosexual men eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese Government has since 2003 promised universal access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters says that a GOP employee has disclosed data to senators, and denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages devoted to legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by "extremely right-wing" experts and websites.
"Literally lies, lies, and still false indignants" Waters responded in a Twitter statement.
It would appear that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of the U.S. Senators. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the Senate sitting on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed the information of a member of the Waters staff.
According to Waters, "this unfounded allegation is completely false and absolute lie."
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information."
"This false allegation is completely false and a true lie."
Waters' statement quickly triggered online criticism, including by Ari Fleischer, the former press officer of the White House.
"This denial is anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that it does not possess the necessary temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something that he or she did not do, he or she must not be angry.
She must not be provocative.
She must not question the accused's reasons.
She must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the Democrats' criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during the mid-term elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office had alerted “the authorities and agencies responsible for the enforcement of the laws concerned” about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all the members of my team."
Johnny Français has hit again. Rowan Atkinson's parody, an under-daughter spy
It has become a tradition to search for the reach of Brexit in any new British film and it seems to apply to this resumption of the Johnny Français action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny Français and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny Français, the return.
Will ironic self-satisfaction on the question of the evidentness of our insignificance represent our country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Français, with his throated eyes and rubber face, saw his licence renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his questionable attempts at glamour, owns a bit of Clouseau, a suspect of Mr. Bean and a good dose of the type that performs a small note in Les Chariots de fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Originally, he is also inspired by the international traveller and mystery man Atkinson once played in the television commercials Barclaycard, now forgotten, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny Français has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny Français approaching a helicopter when he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor blades hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is enhanced, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses like 007 and Mission impossible make up themselves in confidence with the comedy.
Humor seems to be more directed towards children than towards adults and, for me, the crazy misadventures of Johnny Français are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's silent movie gigs in Bean's character.
The perpetuity of the matter is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer hacker infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great disarray of agents in service - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the drop that gets the vase spilled for a prime minister who is a pumpy character at the edge of the crisis and who already suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there's not much to put under the tooth in the scenario.
His intelligence advisors informed him that every active spy who had been compromised would have to take someone out of his retirement.
This means that Johnny Français himself needs to be disturbed, which is now employed in a chic institution as a school teacher, but which secretly teaches about how to become a secret agent: a few great jokes here, because Français proposes a spy academy like Rock Academy.
Français returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and found Bough, his former long-term partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who create great trouble with Her Majesty's secret services, come to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the control of the technological charismatic billionaire who says he is able to solve the computer problems of Britain: the disaster of Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
Français and Bough launch their odysse of crazy jokes: under the disguise of servers, they set fire to a bright French restaurant; they create a chaos by faking on Volta's luxurious sailor; and Français triggers a real anarchy when he tries, with a helmet of virtual reality, to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
All stops are secured for this last sequence, but despite all that, there's not a lot of stuff for kids in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't stop thinking, as with other films by Johnny Français: Can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will truly value his talent?
The Labour Party has not drawn up a plan to allow British workers to work four days but to be paid for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to make use of the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an additional day of leave.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while continuing to receive the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic programme and the plans to direct the country towards workers.
The move to a four-day week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party stated in the Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not happen in one night, but a four-day working week is an objective that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not at the moment supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party."
The alternate Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to give details of his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was committed to re-establishing power in the hands of "anonym administrators" and " profiteers" in public utilities.
The alternative chancellor's plans also provide that the current shareholders of the water companies may not be able to recover all of their stakes, as the labour government could operate "deductions" due to alleged conduct deviations.
It has also confirmed its plan for the integration of workers into the boards of directors of companies and the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, which will hold up to £500 of dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy give "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed for at least one week after the FBI investigation into the charges against him and raised the question of whether the Bureau's findings could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, the 60 Minutes correspondent, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy says.
"By going to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was resolved, determined, unequivocal."
However, Graham's vote seems engraved in the stone.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and you'd need an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied him categorically," said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she named couldn't check it out.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I see nothing new that changes."
What has the Global Citizen Festival done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive number of stars and an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now at its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people moving to Central Park's Great Lawn in order not only to benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, the first of which was held in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively combat it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a global leader, calling or making any other useful effort to raise public awareness of the fight against poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people through a free concert really convince them to call for action, or is it just another example of "clictivism" - a situation in which people really think they make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped to encourage global leaders to take on commitments and to adopt policies of over $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, including a portion of at least $10 billion that has already been disbursed or lifted.
The Group believes that the funds secured have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and performers who have committed themselves to "help children develop their full potential", while promising Rwanda a 35 million pounds grant to help put an end to malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving over 4,700 Global Citizens messages.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador to The Power of Nutrition at a concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, as a result of the undertaking of more than 5,000 actions aimed at requesting the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "what makes you think it is possible to put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to achieve this will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, as the great civil rights and apartheid defence movements before us, we will do so, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will be performing this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
The United States could use the Navy to create a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary Internal
In order to avoid Russian energy coming into the markets, including the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the American Navy, revealed Ryan Zinke, the American Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that the presence of Russia in Syria - in particular, where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext for it to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they are in the Middle East with the aim of negotiating energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
"The United States, along with our Navy, can ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed participants at the consumer energy alliance event, a not-for-profit organization that defined itself as the "speaker of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in reality identical.
"As regards Iran and Russia, the economic option is more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia, saying that Russia has "more than one rope to its arc" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has undertaken to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration representatives, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the "inappropriate" project from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, is making the city of Berlin "incarnate" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech delivered in Moscow in September following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary, the Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said, "I believe we share this view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The United States position has generated negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to be involved in European energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of attending the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider the possibility of attending the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider presenting herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that to happen, a woman will have to be at the top," she says, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider submitting my candidature to the presidential."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public gathering, saying that he "led this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and of the candidate for the Supreme Court of the latter, Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday, in a Twitter message, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not think it should be in 2020.
According to the Political Research Centre survey of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey found that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other very well-known names of democrats for a potential campaign in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin recalls Track Palin PTSD during Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
Monday evening, he was arrested and accused in the course of an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son is experiencing right now, what he feels when he comes home, I can connect him to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some injuries with which our soldiers return," she said to the public at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as a "Tabou subject" and said about his son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if one respects what their comrades and members of the air forces, and every other member of the military, have given to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a relationship of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of feud.
18 States and the Columbia District are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the Columbia District are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new American policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a memorandum in favour of an asylum seeker who challenged this policy, said NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Freedoms Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs," had assaulted her, but the U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generated a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy cancelled a decision issued in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy “is unaware of decades of state, federal and international law”.
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," the amicus curiae stated in his memorandum.
Counsel also argued in the memo that the policy of refusing immigrants to enter the U.S. economy is harmful, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
" Asylum is granted to persons who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political belief," said Sessions on 11 June in their announcement of that policy.
" Asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious ones -- that people face every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while double death in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dramatic.
"I feel very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her young, fiendly boy in Palu, in an empty city evacuation centre.
“In every moment, an ambulance comes back from the bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents have been seen travelling to their destroyed homes, picking up unbridled property, and trying to save what they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in front of the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated externally due to persistent strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes when he told him how he felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris told Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
United States Ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" by means of "promotion advertising"
One week after a Chinese official newspaper posted a four-page advertisement of the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China in an American daily, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the supplement paid by China Daily in the De Moines Register - the most popular newspaper sold in Iowa - after accused China of trying to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary elections on November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
In accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in the U.S. elections, Trump noted what U.S. officials said in Reuters was a new phase in a growing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at hitting State exporters such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, United States ambassador to China and former long-time Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had done harm to U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion article published in the De Moines Register of Sunday, "is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom by inserting an advertising fee into the Des Moines Register," says Branstad.
"On the other hand, at the Beijing press desk, you will find little protesting voices and will not see the real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have on the disturbing Chinese economic path, for the media are firmly in line with the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers avoided publishing" his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn that Republicans alienate voters from mid-term elections because of the debacle of Kavanaugh
While many high-ranking Republicans are defending Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court in a context of sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the next mid-term elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already publicly demonstrated that they want the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse stated "that we cannot go back".
Reeher added that he doubted that the last minute efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) in support of an FBI investigation were sufficient to calm the voters' anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Advisor and National Spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said on September 28 according to the Washington newspaper.
Friday morning, Mic reported, the protesters sang "The month of November arrives!" in the corridor of the Senate while the Republicans governing the Judicial Committee chose to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be exaggerated," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially among suburbs voters and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, even if they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominate, analysts suggested that the reaction might be lively if the Republicans made progress with the confirmation.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, former Chairman of the National Republican Committee, said at the beginning of last week that "This has become a confused disorder for the GOP."
"It's not just the vote of the committee or the final vote, or the appointment of Kavanaugh. It's also how the Republicans managed the situation and how they handled it," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps the elected Democrats in the television newspaper.
However, following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, the Americans appear to be divided about the credibility of both parties, a small majority leaning on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of the people consulted believed in or believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed in or believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates allegations made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, after Senator Flake's pressure.
Ford sworn to the Senate Judicial Committee last week that she had been attacked by Kavanaugh when he was in a state of frenzy at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they studied in Yale in the 1980s, the candidate in the Supreme Court would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is considering launching a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee's Solid Free Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is saved, as well as those allowed to access such information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said it was a joke that Inrupt aimed to "dominant the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The particular feature of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through the data".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers working on the project and a community of voluntary coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team and he are not yet in discussion with "Facebook and Google" in order to know whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely jammed in a moment.
"We do not ask them permission."
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that "the mission [of Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although he has launched Inruptible, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Ceremony of a Church of the First World War Decorated by the Victoria Cross
The only ecclesiastical Church in England to have received the Victorian Cross during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in its hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and did not know that he had won the highest British military distinction.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, claimed that he was "brightly symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploit.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under violent gunfire."
Later, he rushed on the shooting line and, with the "greatest bravery", guided the line before jumping a country gun on his own and sleeping three soldiers from the squadron.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant-Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, claimed that his grandfather's actions were "one thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann commissioned that he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people".
Mixed martial arts fans stayed awake all night watching Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent the night watching a full Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event had 13 fights, six of which were on the main record, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, UK viewers were screened when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were dissatisfied with being awake until early morning especially for the fight.
A Twitter supporter described the transition to children's cartoon as "a kind of bad joke."
With respect to transmission, Bellator's Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communications, Dave Schwartz, stated that "the government's regulations provide that at 6 o'clock in the morning, this content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children's programming."
"Peppa the Pig", yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about redistributing, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
“However, it’s six o’clock in the morning a Sunday and we won’t be able to find a solution before Sunday our hour, or Monday their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program crashed, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you this won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we have tried to give more for fans and we have ruined everything.
This is a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" in terms of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this has given him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "everyone was not like me."
As part of the first show of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the issue of homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The usual presenter of the program, Kirsty Young, took a several-month leave because of her illness.
Seems nauseous in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" all other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength necessary for my success."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something," he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medallist is now a renowned LGBT activist and took advantage of his participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed himself because he felt he was fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications, and that he wanted to restore "hope" to others.
The triple world champion claimed that he "did not wait" to fall in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Dale married Oscar's 20-year-old winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When we see so many things at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who knew the same highs and lows.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley stated that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you interviewed me last year, I was just thinking of winning a gold medal," he says.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale told him that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him to do was whether they already had their tickets to London in 2012, because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "Daddy, you won't be here anymore to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and he died so that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"That was all I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of a crowd at the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, this inspired him with his first choice of song - Proud of Heather Small - which had accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and always gave him the chicken flesh.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15, BST.
An Out of shape Mickelson on the bench of the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to recover to avoid it being a unfortunate stage.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was eliminated by Captain Jim Furyk from the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the fifth big champion shared his day between the role of supporting and the skin finishing of his stand game with the aim of remedying his evils.
He has never been the greatest leader, even at the top of his career. At age 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where long rough systematically punishes the miscarriages.
And as if the race route wasn't scary enough in itself, Mickelson, at the ninth Sunday match, faced Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood this week to win their four games.
If the Americans, at four downs at the beginning of the 12 singles games, take a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a tape in my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in him.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so much to those teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the largest number of encounters at the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup which has never quite reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven defeats in his assets, although Furyk has stated that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to laugh at people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players had a great time meeting him this week, which was fun to see.
He's doing much more than playing."
European selection captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that a significant advance before the simple last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be transformed into a painful journey.
The Danes fought his first game in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team with the captain Seve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but finally got to the top of the ranking with the lowest possible gap on the finish line, taking him 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop remembering that we were going largely to Valderrama; we had a big advance in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but rightly," said Bjorn, after observing the 2018 Ranking win 5-3 at both Friday and yesterday in the National Golf to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go deep tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, to try to win this trophy, and that is where we have to stay focused.
I've always said I'm focused on the 12 players in our camp, but we're very aware of what's going on on the other side - they're the best players in the world."
Ravi of the performances of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never make any progress on this point.
Tomorrow, it's a whole different pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow it will be the individual performances that will be presented and everything else.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you're there in solitary, you're being put to the test for your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message to get players to get the best of yourself tomorrow.
When one leaves his partner behind, he must go and shoot the best of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of the last day's turnarounds, after being part of the winning team at Brookline before losing at the end of the "Medinah Miracle", where Europe broke off the victory.
"I remember every word," he explains in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this fast start as you saw at Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We have established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we had to do, we are trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of carrying out the counter-attack and will face Rory McIllroy in the first class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I have accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire course," Bjorn said on his selections in simple terms.
The new warship of Germany still postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to defective systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the launch of the "Rhineland-Pfalz" was postponed in the first half of 2019.
The ship should have integrated the Navy in 2014, but the problems of concern after delivery have compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Bade-Wurtemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful canon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-native missiles, as well as certain furtive technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frigates for a period of up to two years outside the home ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the continuing delays mean that the avant-garde warships - which should allow Germany to project its force overseas - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a naval manufacturer after delivery.
The reasons for this return were not well known, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and hardware defects” that made the warship unnecessary in the event of deployment on a combat mission.
The faults of the software were particularly important because the ships of the class Bade-Württemberg will be operated by a crew composed of about 120 sailors, corresponding to half of the crews of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the vessel is significantly overcharged, which reduces its performance and reduces the Marine's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000 tons “Rhineland-Pfalz” weighs twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the project price as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said that it has reached the astronomical sum of EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), compared with the original amount of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent alerts that Germany's naval force is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Commission of the German Parliament, earlier this year recognised that the Navy is in fact "in fact short of ships capable of deploying".
The manager stated that the situation had had a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were designated.
He regretted that none of the Bade-Wurtemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research in an area of the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these single flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland's research will be followed by community and sopranos pipistrels as well as brown long-eared bats and Daubenton at Inverewe's garden in Wester Ross.
Special registration devices will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of bat cry and the activities of different species.
A habitat map and report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on a territorial basis.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as prairie creation and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the perch and causes habitat loss.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as attacks of company cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated school-leaving technique to identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS is responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, and takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perch inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization also established the first and only reserve of Scottish bats at the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
David Thompson, domain manager, says the site is the ideal site for them.
"Here in Threave, we have an ideal place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there is still much to learn about bats, so that the work we do here and in other places will help us better understand what bats need to prosper."
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of bats before maintaining the properties, because by destroying the property without the desire of a single maternity nest, 400 females and small and even the disappearance of a whole local population could be killed.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or destroy their perchors.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help her.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and about many of our species, we don't know what's happening in their populations right now."
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape while his lawyers are preparing to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the charges of rape against him as "false information," and claimed that people "want to make themselves known" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to continue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would then have paid him $375,000 to keep silent about this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
Speaking to its 142 million fans in a live video posted on Instagram, a few hours after the broadcast of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, described this information as "false information".
"No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information," said the camera to the fifth winner of the Gold Balloon.
“They want to do the pub by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel about these allegations, which they have described as "an unacceptable denunciation of suspicions in the area of privacy."
Counsel Christian Schertz stated that the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in proportion to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a follow-up to the Hotel-casino le Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would occur, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a "boy" to "99%" but that he did not know what he was going to do with the remaining "1 percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that they were consented.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly settlement because she felt "frightened by reprisals" and feared "to be subjected to public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman states that she is now seeking to cancel this settlement as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve under a EUR 100 million contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will forever regret" the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the United Kingdom "will forever regret it" if it lost its status as the world leader in automotive construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production in its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border in the event of Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures the Auris and Avensis vehicles in Toyota - built nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I believe that if Great Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini plant at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what automotive manufacturers regard as risk to the supply chain in the event of Brexit failure to agree.
The Toyota production line is operated in "spanned flows" and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the EU for vehicles manufactured on-demand.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom left the EU unacceptably, there could be border disturbances that, according to industry, could lead to delays and coin shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU "is precisely calibrated in order to avoid these border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to take advantage of the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in the BBC's Radio 4's Today program.
"The obvious thing, not only Toyota but also other manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to maintain what has proved to be an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term the additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the Unite union at the factory and who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members were increasingly worried: "In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back."
A spokesman for the government said, "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The White House announces that Trump and Rosenstein could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "refused by a week", while the struggle for the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser to investigate Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's collaborators and Russia, and the possible obstacles to justice exercised by the President.
The question of whether Trump will meet with the Deputy Attorney General or not, and so will endanger Mueller's independence, has been fuelling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a micro to record the Trump conversations and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday he came to the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump indicated that he "would not" refer Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission in front of which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, still delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press officer Sarah Sanders made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "No date has been set for that, it could be this week, I could see if we are again being pushed back from a week in view of all the other things that are going on at the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I like to keep the press informed."
The claim would be challenged by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conferences at the White House.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of the lectures was not due to an aversion for "demagogic" television reporters, although she stated: "I have nothing against the fact that they are stifling the gallery."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without any evidence, she added that "the President participates in more questions-answer sessions than any other President before him": "We checked the numbers."
Press conferences will always take place, says Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to question the President of the United States directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this frequently, you have seen it well in recent weeks, and it will take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
There are rarely press conferences there on the solo.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, by making a casual appearance and at times a strange appearance in front of the gathered journalists.
Concerning the concerns about Brexit, the Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in the NHS Scotland
The Secretary for Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
The Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for status for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer negotiations on withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to lead to decisions this fall.
But the British Government has also intensified its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate the extent to which I consider the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is quite your home and we really want you to stay here."
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, from Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the second of the Tennessee Tigers, was an emergency operation after a head injury on Saturday during the Vanderbilt Commodores defeat 31-27.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the Tennessee State, told journalists that the injury occurred just before mid-time.
"He arrived on the touch line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a cage and taking another test.
A Tennessee State Representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris stated that there was "no information yet about the type or extent of the injury" and that the Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an athlete student in the second year, is in his first season with the State of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five coats in total Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his total of the season to 18 coats.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp fees if they buy property in the United Kingdom and the extra money will be used to help homeless people in the new Conservative regimes.
This measure will cancel Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp rate if they buy property in the United Kingdom - the extra money will help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to strengthen the government's efforts to help homeless people.
This surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on secondary residences and rental rentals - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to £120 million a year.
About 13% of new London buildings are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which increases prices and prevents first-accessors from entering the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
This new policy occurs only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a reduction in stamping rights to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing large construction companies to keep real estate prices at a high level by gaining land without using it, he invited May to waive quotas on affordable housing in order to settle the "real estate discount" in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including the monitoring of rents and the abolition of "no fault" expulsions.
It would also like to give advice on how to build new housing.
May said: "Last year, I said that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies to buy a house as for British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of access to the property has become far away and the poverty of homeless people remains too real."
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland's technician, Jack Ross, explains that his "ultimate ambition" is to become the Scottish selectionist at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is pleased to meet the challenge of reborn the North East Club, which currently ranks third in the League 1 at three points in the leader.
He won the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I used to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," said Ross at the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But I grew up following Scotland's matches in Hampden with my father, and that's one thing I've never forgotten.
This opportunity, on the other hand, would only be presented if I succeeded in the management of the club."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's selectors are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Technician of Alloa Athletic states that he did not hesitate to rank behind such emblematic names in such a big club, having already declined the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in light of the question "can I bring this club back to the Premier League?"
Because of the structure and infrastructure of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he added.
"It's not easy to do that, but I'd probably think of myself as a success here only if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa up from a third division legation and transformed St Mirren, who was on the edge of the legation, into a major winner of the championship the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Alloa's support "probably was a real crossroads," he recalls.
"I really thought being a coach was better than playing.
This seems strange because I have gone out well, I have earned my life well, and I have benefited from some remarkable peaks.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There's a lot of details to settle every week.
I continue to live this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is fine with me.
I always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I have been in my entire adult life."

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer canicle raised the revenue of the British pubs in difficulty, but increased pressure on the restaurant chains.
The figures show that the bar and pub groups recorded an increase of 2.7% in their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consulting firm, which compiled the data, said: "The permanent sunshine and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup made July follow the model of June, where the bars had increased by 2.8%, except for restaurants, which suffered even more shock.
The 1.8% decrease in the catering sector in June only increased in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most popular, with more points of resemblance than the restaurants that go down.
Food pubs have also been affected by the effects of the sun, but not as much as the restorers.
Looks like people just want to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, a specialist leisure analyst and RSM hospitality, said: "These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in domestic sales.
Not surprisingly, restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, although a 4.8% annual average drop in sales is particularly painful, in addition to continuing cost pressures.
Long and hot weather could not have been less suitable for food business operators and time will tell us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give us a well-deserved discount."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the location.
The sales of the industry are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyses the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds sterling and constitutes the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that he hides from his parents
According to a survey, one in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - have secret accounts on the social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in the "false Insta" pages
The news highlighted concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "main" account to show to their parents
One in five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - open an account on the social media he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news highlighted concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students said they managed a clean "main" account to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to "violate me."
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 have a double profile, with half of students accepting private accounts.
CSM Chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will represent athletes on the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described this as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of his extensive experience at the international level these ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys tremendous respect within the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from its participation in the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre events in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympic Games, where he won four gold medals and is now a regular commentator of the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a PCN.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would say if I recovered or to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I recovered completely, I started to walk again and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Online, an advertisement on the milk-making that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a company offering a sucker compares nursing mothers to cows when trading.
In order to mark the launch of what is called the "first silent draw in the world", Elvie, a public technology company, launched a bold ad inspired by a musical video to show the freedom that its new silent draw offers to breastfeeding women.
In a hay-filled cow barn, four true mothers dance at the pace of a song whose words are: "Yes, I do, but you don't see a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, it's my breasts, not the mothers."
The chorus continues: "Pump it,pump it, feed the babies,pump it,pump it,pump it,pump it,I help women who carry milk."
However, advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has led to online polemics.
With 77,000 sightings and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"A poor decision than the decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days following their birth," wrote one of them.
The Elvie laureate adapts discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "This is understandable trauma to both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why don't you use them to advertise a gunfire for the mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone else added, "An ad so disconnected."
Others defended advertising, for example, a woman admitting that she found the song "sounding".
"I think it's an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I was still swimming.
Pumper made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a fun ad for moms who pull their milk (often at work or in the toilets) and feel like cows."
It is not advertising that praises the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show that they danced with the discreet pulleys hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the gun say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie laureate is completely silent, with no wires or pipes, and quietly inserts itself into a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even get out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and DPE at Mother commented: "Elvie's laureate is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By paralleling breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk-kit will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's play is one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the stage of her designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children settled silently in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly due to the fact that the severe speeches and policies of the Trump administration have made the placements of children more difficult for respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they were afraid of compromising their own ability to stay in the country by taking a child's rescue.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their homes should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no judicial record.
"Almost 80% of those who are respondents or family members are illegal here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people," said Albence.
According to shelterers, in order to speed up the treatment of children, the authorities introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear before the court within the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to plead their case with regard to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons found to be non-eligible will be expelled quickly.
According to the stakeholders and reports presented in recent months by the network of shelters, the longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to bursts of violence or escape attempts.
In a large facility such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to the defenders of the child's rights.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate trauma that many have difficulty managing.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they "will be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem argued that the "war on terrorism is almost complete" in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to carry out this sacred battle until all Syrian territories were purged" both of the two terrorist groups and of any "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom form and advise both the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moualem stated regarding refugees, that the conditions were favourable for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “promote irrational concerns” that have deterred refugees from returning.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier,” he said.
"They are politicalizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have indicated that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war is concluded.
The United Nations diplomats state that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for the establishment of a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress in Idlib has allowed for progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement provided for "specific deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military measures would target the jihadists, in particular the Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who will be "eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, representing the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second mandate
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many Liberal viewers probably hope, the dismissal and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
Which would probably be "the most spectacular finale of a presidency!"
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, top-time ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have virtually tripled, to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at great listening hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million viewers in big evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a matter that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC's "Designated Survivor" drama series, which speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scout, a seasoned comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about sliding into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory for her.
She recalls having taken a taxi to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr Trump.
Why? Did she ask him.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovel.
Chaos has a fun value.
Clearly, unlike anything on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if immigrant families can meet and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most wealthy viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when we find ourselves looking at a panel of experts for six hours to discuss how Bob Woodward used a "deep know-how" for his book "Fear," on the leather jacket at $15,000 Paul Manafort ("a dress of pride" according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered from, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
For my part, I will never again see Super Mario the same way.
"If part of what he's doing gives the impression of seeing a tele-reality show, it's because he swallows you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Director General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's changing teams and daily situation turns (to fight with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode or we're on the trail.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was doing 26 degrees at home on the north bank of Kauai, but he would get inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not resign, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was preparing to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at issue.
"I remember the time when we were hosting all these crazy programs and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money invades the tightest mid-term elections
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania was flooded with money, thanks to a re-adjustment of Congress electoral districts, which allowed two licensees to fight for the same seat.
This district of the Pittsburgh suburb, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of the Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who took up his seat in another constituency during the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured by another holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps the new 17th district.
The cards were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district has given the impetus to a confrontation with regard to the financing of electoral campaigns between the major branches of party financing, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory won in fairness last March during a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing Salvador for its support for China, and then declining.
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington had not opposed.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with the Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the State Department decided to convene the heads of United States diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesman for the Department, at the beginning of the month in a communiqué.
However, sanctions have been imposed only against Salvador, which received US$140 million in 2017, particularly to control drugs and provide development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings continued, representatives of North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting held last year, perceived as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from travelling to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue and thus put an end to any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence would now like to speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in order to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats indicated.
And the three U.S. emissaries are quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any further severe messages or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the cover of anonymity.
Their statements were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying History
The next tile could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation to the question of a connivance of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be required to report to that body as he prepares to represent himself before the voters and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
There are many of them "if", and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - or that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, the German officers were about to organise a coup against Hitler, if only the West had held his head and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these cracks and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
The Americans are currently facing a number of these cracks.
What will we do if Mr Trump refers the deputy to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the newspaper reported that last year he proposed to keep the president in secret and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the report of the Times is inaccurate.
"What will we do if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confided in the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in mid-term elections for a Congress that will ask Mr Trump to account?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will pass through a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, immigrants to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles on the Sabbath on the swastika table.
With this heritage in heritage, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans des Rangers, confiding against the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, while being aware that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive Spanish match against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, placed them in a solid position to qualify as Group G in the League of Europe.
A knee injury took the middle of the ground Graham Dorrans from his first participation of the season to the zero match 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the best of such a result to achieve exploitations.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a high-quality team," commented the 31-year-old attacker.
"We entered the game thinking about getting something, and we left with a point.
We might have been able to win it at the end, but overall, a blank match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they have done a good result at their last match, nevertheless I am sure that we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is of quality.
Let's hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear about their retirement savings
Although the survey participants knew clearly how they wanted to deal with them, few people raised the issue with their families.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study stated that they spoke with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent reported having spoken to their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do the necessary to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Branch.
Here's where to start.
Tell your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't communicate your wishes well in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost of care.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you determine how to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a buy-in hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover these expenses or another insurance on your heritage - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the crossing.
Provide health care provision that will allow you to identify a trusted person who will verify your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a provision concerning your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure payment of your invoices if you are disabled.
Think of the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be prepared well.

A man was wounded several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several bullets fired with a compressed air gun as he returned on foot from an evening.
The victim, aged about 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2:30 a.m. TSB, as a "adequate act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries do not threaten his life, and the police have called for witnesses.
Seisms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, announced the authorities, and the balance is expected to increase.
Since communications were paralyzed, the relief services were unable to receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the peak of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, whose population was estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquakes and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coasts to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The population of Regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, and particularly of the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times since a century, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Reduction.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of residences in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, making 226 000 victims on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias off Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 magnitude reached southern Java, Indonesia's most inhabited island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and made nearly 700 victims.
2009: An earthquake of a magnitude of 7.6 shook the city of Padang, capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude devastated one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake shook the Regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastating earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes shook the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake has destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, 29-year-old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, in violation of a report of domestic violence and resistant to arrest, according to a press release published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he reportedly took the phone from a female woman who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin was placed in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su Pre-Trial Detention Centre and was held under unsecured bail of $500, reported KTUUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, claiming "no guilty, it's safe" when his plea was sought from him, announced the network.
Palin is facing three class A offences, which means that he may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a Class B minor offence, punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is pending before the Alaskan veterans' court.
In January 2016, he was charged with spousal violence, interference in the report of a crime of spousal violence and possession of a weapon in a state of ebrity in connection with the incident.
His partner claimed he hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour with PTSD from her service in Iraq.
Seism in Indonesia: Hundreds of Deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake that shook Indonesia's island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of houses.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are failing and the victims' balance sheet is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the centre of Sulawesi, northeastern Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami broke out on the coast.
Federal Prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are asking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged assassin in New York who has made eight victims - a rare sentence that has not been applied in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, would have used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a bicycle track on the West Side Highway road in Lower Manhattan, collapsing on his pedestrian road and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" murdered the eight victims and "intentionally" imposed serious body damage, according to the statement of intent to seek the capital punishment filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after this attack, a large federal jury sentenced Saipov to 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for misappropriation of funds, generally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a careful preparation and premeditation," the prosecutors claimed, calling the method used by Saipov "dious, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," states the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The South District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in prosecution for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years following the cold war.
The two Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed the tragedy, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was content with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he was encouraged to commit the attack after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to post Daesh's flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal public defenders, said he was "of course disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than to accept his plea of guilt and to condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the People's Army" at a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former UK Independence Party said that politicians should feel the pressure of Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested, it should be charged with negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom "has already been released" had Mr. Farage been secretary in Brexit.
But the dilemma that Mrs May faces to reconcile her deeply divided troops was highlighted by the Conservatives in favour of staying in the Union, which joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulty in maintaining his Chequers compromise plan despite the threats posed by those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as by the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and the workers to choose between its programme and the "sacrifice".
Mr. Bone told the meeting of the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted "to get rid of Chequers".
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have gone out already," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We are not engaged in global wars to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our own homeland."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people turned the page and wanted to stay is completely wrong."
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, in favour of the release, was also present at the march to tell journalists: "I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chessers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is also the case of our party and our activists who are on the streets and make us elect first and foremost.
Abandon Chequers and start listening."
In a message directed towards May, she added: The Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they honour their promises."
"Mr. Farage told the meeting that politicians should be "stake pressure" if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the context of the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They try to deceive Brexit and we tell them today: "We will not let you out of it like this."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: "I wish you felt the pressure on our political class to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that has allowed us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, pro-European followers walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists branded Conservative banners against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives because of the security issues regarding the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"They are the ones that assure us that they are in a position to put in place the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, more, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real joke.
A good Brexit doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of presenting himself to the presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren states that she will seriously consider the possibility of attending the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future Saturday at a public assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, presented for the November re-election against Geoff Diehl, representative of the GOP in the States, who was co-chair in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She found herself in the center of speculation that Trump might face by 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at a public meeting since Trump took office.
One participant asked if she intended to introduce herself to the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means having a woman head of state."
Arrest during Sims' death by bullet from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, Baton Rouge's police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by bullet of the basketball player Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Service participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
Friday, they had posted a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying a man who was on the pictures.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and killed in his injuries," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, on Saturday, at 247 sports.
Wayde took the defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Asked, Simpson admitted to being in the scene, in possession of a gun, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a 2 m boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, fought 32 games, 10 of them as last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is heading for the world title after the team's guidelines allowed him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became obvious from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified by challenging Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the instructions of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas took a good start and frowned Hamilton on the side as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to enter the torment at the tail of the peloton, which should have been a decisive element.
Mercedes went through the stands one later and found itself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took advantage after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari pilot leaving the interior at the risk of resisting a double defense attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated a large part of the race while maintaining his tires to aim for a speed finish and advanced Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived in the booths in the 44th turn, but was not able to accelerate the rhythm in the remaining eight laps, Raikkonen ranked fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did an exceptional job to get a two," said Hamilton.
It was a very bad body language
During a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein, who pointed out that she had not unveiled Christine Blasey Ford's letter that accuses the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in Western Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission, but argued that the events outside the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"By seeing the disclosures and the leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you disclosed any information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose any information - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we disclose any information... No, we did not disclose any information," he added, thinking about the honourable senator's impression.
Feinstein received last July from Ford the letter describing in detail the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place early in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," said Feinstein to the committee, saying The Hill.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me."
But his negation does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday evening at the gathering: "I'll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take over power by all means.
You see wickedness, messery, they don't know who they're hurting, who they have to crush to get power and control," said the President to Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars eliminated their Friday defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by setting off the 5-3 game back to Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought equality back home before Dwyer gave the Giants an advantage.
François Bouchard equalled Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen entered two goals, ensuring victory for them.
It was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast, after being caught.
It was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants having triumphed in the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage to the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During the first busy period, Sullivan re-launched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt joined Cownie at 15:16 with an equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team met and Bouchard again equalized with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen put Dundee in the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, thus ensuring victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal in the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will welcome Milton Keynes during their next game Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on a plane to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died, ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many others disappeared after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to ravage the region and many people are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to abandon his position in the tower that was violently shaken at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could take off safely.
He then jumped off the control tower when he felt she was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the ABC News Australian.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn that," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths will reach thousands, the country's disaster prevention agency indicating that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to grow, as many bodies were still under the debris and many could not be saved," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves measuring up to six metres have ravaged Palu, which will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings bodies back.
Clean water is rare.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help survivors, but we are unaware of what they will find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the military in the country: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man has disappeared after the crash of an aircraft in the lagoon.
The airline operating the flight crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now states that a man is missing, after the 47 passengers and crew have safely evacuated the plane that was flowing.
Air Niugini stated in a press release that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to trace a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to more specific passenger information requests, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels took part in the rescue of the other passengers and the crew after the aircraft hit the water trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
On Saturday, the airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft landed in the lagoon near the landing runway.
Witnesses estimated that the aircraft had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes indicated that the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes stated that he and the others were able to slide into the water until the aircraft's rescue exits were running.
He claimed that the officers panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a minor injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy stated that the sailors who were working nearby to improve a dock had also participated in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people on land before the aircraft flows in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
The Air Safety Network data indicate that 111 people died in accidents involving air carriers registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them related to Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned his case on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records of phone calls made from a cell phone to track the 29-year-old, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night the accused died.
Rowlett indicated that he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis e found with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, told The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford showed up at the bar on Saturday and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replied that he "was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another incoherence lies in the fact that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Telephone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis removed the SMS, calls and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," said Hale.
The defense must begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be before the jury during the day.
The High Breed: What is the political hip hop?
A trio hip hop wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by imbuing its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip hop has been alienated from its origins from political messages and social issues.
The group wants to re-engage with its roots and make the hip hop political again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York-born boy pursues a couple in court for dismissing him after a "racist" texto
A New York-born boy is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message mistakenly transmitted by the mother who complained that she was "another black."
The couple refuses to be racist, and assimilates prosecution to an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed her disappointment by finding in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanou, was Black when she arrived for her first day of work.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE A NORTH", writes Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her gaffe, "unfortunately comfortable," Plasco-Flaxman returned Ms. Maurice, explaining to her that their former nephew, who was an African American, had done a bad job and that she was waiting for a Philippine.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day, then returned home by a Uber.
Mauritius now pursues the couple in court to obtain compensation for their return and seeks compensation of $350 per day for the six-month home service for which it was initially hired, but without a contract.
"I want them to understand, listen, we don't do these things," she explained to Post Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to put an end to Maurice's employment, fearing that he would not be trusted after he had done wrong.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco at Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone with whom you were rude, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Assimilating the trial to a "extortion", Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months old to have a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"You'd go after someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do," added the business banker.
While the case is still ongoing, the public opinion court did not hesitate to denounce the couple on the social media, blaming them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not identify themselves with a bear who spoke, unveiling a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It is difficult to replace someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun, knowing what we know about Paddington's enormous success."
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a little pudding bear, would have remained optimistic about the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had had a sweet-mother taste after her death last year.
She described Paddington as a "very important member of our family," adding that her father was very proud of her final success.
"It was a calm man, and it was not a pretentious man," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who does something: we're proud of him, even if it's not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her goodbye to the phone.
At the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect her to get away with it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given him to maintain heart rate were slowly exhausting and leaving his system.
She died some time before and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold onto it."
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, in the grief of her daughter, went on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight that I felt that immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Women in mourning lay postcards to prevent suicide on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide try to prevent others from taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted postcards on a Welsh bridge containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm forced to feel on a daily basis," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and residing in Lydney, said that her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room."
However, he abandoned his job before dying, since he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11-year-old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid there's a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know there are people you can go to and to who you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Do not be silent, you must speak.”
Ms. Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Mrs. Davis's, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt shot down, depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we saw his change of attitude.
He was at his lowest Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She said that her death had represented a huge trauma to them, but they have to get out of it: "It's tearing for the family.
It destroys us.
But we must all move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for - a limited investigation in time, limited in its scope - we could perhaps bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee "will not collapse" in a partisan deadlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will only take place in five weeks, on 6 November. If, as planned, Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr.Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and met with his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI has presented its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to resign the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of "fall" deserters under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has declined since the rise in the power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago, declared a South Korean legislature.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Southern Unity, stated that 1,127 deserts had taken place last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing tariffs claimed by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of North deserters will ultimately be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them flee from China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them forcefully.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in talks focused on denuclearization negotiations that had so far been pending.
This happened after the historic June meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho imputed the US sanctions to the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to operate unilateral disarmament,” said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and claims that he is unfit to sit at the Supreme Court
Pelosi, a leader of the parliamentary minority, qualified the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and stated that he was unfit to sit in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman had behaved in this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with emotion, denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost shouted and suffocated by talking about his family and years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting on the committee, calling it allegations of " grotesque and coordinated murder" organized by disappointed Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to sit at the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he's discriminating himself with these statements and the way he's done with Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to dismiss Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he does not say the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but he is also unfit to sit in the court where he is at the moment," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi also added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh rejected the question of the possible reversal of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect us to say, "Isn't that wonderful," said Pelosi.
And women need to use it.
It is a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that overflows, and it cannot bring it out without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was standing somewhere, who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was angry and crying: "You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found that brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an excuse to anger, partly because they are fundamentally incomprehensible.
One of my most remarkable memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where I one day found myself crying with an inexpressible rage, was having been seized by the skin of the neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always terrified me a little - who led me into a stairway.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They believe you sad and are glad because they have had you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic MP of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair on board a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of introducing herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a tough decision," she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates already, and the last thing he missed was one more person.
Someone called it "Blanche-Neige and the Seven Nains."
As the campaign was very advanced, it had been delayed in the fund-raising process, and therefore swore that it would not participate unless it raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - the gratitude for the people who had supported her, the frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that she felt that she was so dizzy.
"You would have thought I was having a nervous depression," said Mrs. Schroeder about the press response to her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
"She cried?"
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first rounds of the trade war between the United States and China have been drowsy, and although the battle is far from over, a country disagreement could benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest increase occurred this week with new customs duties affecting items worth US$200 billion (£150 billion), thus taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing responded in kind, most recently affecting customs duties of 5 to 10 per cent of US$60 billion.
China has undertaken to equalize the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest global economy will soon shake.
To reverse Washington is to yield to the demands, but to surrender publicly to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, the experts believe that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to economic slowdown in either country is in fact much more dangerous than the observers have previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia, at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria declares its readiness to return voluntarily to the refugees and requests assistance to rebuild Syria, which has been devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country would improve.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions have now been met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six other millions of people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance for the reconstruction of that devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional or insurrection aid from those countries that sponsored the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the 14.5 point bar needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who found himself in difficulty during most of the tournament, plunged his start into the water in the 16th hole in par-3, transferring his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of four players to have ever reached 5-0-0 since the current tournament format, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated from the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark by the least well-placed player 5-4.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, turned 2 and 1 against the English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the European champion of all times with a total of 25.5 points of career.
"In general, I don't cry, but today it's stronger than I am.
It was a year enlivened.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help it," said Garcia with emotion after the European victory.
He takes the torch to his compatriot John Ram who won the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in simples last Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride, I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said Rahm, age 23.
Woods lost his four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistics for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who picked up 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance concerning his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain time when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Its 12 players have all played very well.
We're going to unite, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going forward.
I love those 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We have to tilt.
We've been overtaken."
