The Valian extra deputies are concerned about what they look like marionets.
Some deputies do not understand why their deputation status should change to the status of "member of Parliament of Wales".
The deputies erupted because of the plans to rename the local meeting at the name of "Parliment Wales".
The deputations of all political views suggest that it's some kind of gratitude.
A deputy Leibar said his colleagues are concerned that it is rhymoned with the words "bullshit" and "fucking."
For readers outside Wales: In the Walsh twp, it means "bullshit" and pwp means "fuzzy".
The deputy said that her group was completely dissatisfied and offered alternatives.
The Valian Conservators said their group was ready to discuss the change of the name of the meeting, but noted that it was a short wording transition from a member of the Valian parliament to the "marians".
In this context, the Valian letter w is pronounced as the Yorkshire English phrase of u.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting a draft law on amendments to the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the assembly deputies call will, of course, be the question of the members themselves."
The Wales government law since 2017 gives the Vale East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the national consultation on proposals that showed wide support for calling the meeting Parliament of Wales.
As for the title of the additional deputy, the Commission has preferred members of the Parliament of Wales or the CHP, but the CHUP option has received the greatest support during public consultations.
The additional deputies are apparently offering alternative options, but the way to reach consensus can become the main pain for the presidency, Ellen Jones, who is supposed to present the change law for several weeks.
Reform regulations will include other changes in the associations, such as the rules for disqualification of additional deputies and changes in the structure of the Bureau.
Additional deputies will make a final vote on what they should be called when they're doing their final work.
Macedonians vote at a referendum on the country's name
On Sunday, the voters vote for changing their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia or against that.
The national voting was organized to solve a long-term issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens, they long insisted that the name of their northern neighbour is a claim to their territory, which prevented the involvement and friendship of Macedonia in the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
President of Macedonia George Ivanov, a referendum for a change of name, said that he would not vote.
But the referendum's followers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is just a cost to pay for the entry into the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
The names of St. Martin's temple are silent, the churches in Harleme fight for existence
"As the old people I spoke to, there were bars and church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"The Day here, neither the other."
He said the extinction of the bars was understandable.
"People have different communications and relations at present," he said.
"The bars are no longer comfortable local living rooms where people walk constantly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that money from sale activated did not stop for such a long period as this waits for leaders, and sooner or later they will return where they began.
The churches, he added, can be replaced by housing houses with condoms filled with people who will not help the temples remaining in the neighborhood.
"The largest majority of the inhabitants who buy condoms in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that will speed up the day when these churches close together, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these condoms will be attended by these churches."
Both churches were built by a group of whites before Harlem became a black district -- the Church of the Steel Society in 1870, the Church of St. Martin -- in a decade.
The original white methodistic community left in the 1930s.
The black communities who prayed around, received the right property to the building.
The Church of St. Martin was captured by a black-core public under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who was headed by the bike of traders at the main trade in Harleme 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote the blackcore.
The fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but the believers under the leadership of the Father Johnson planned a reconstruction: they have introduced corals.
Similar David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the Karilion "the poor people."
The expert who played coullion in July called it "Cultural Treasure" and "the unreplaceable historical tool."
The expert of Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that this was the first carilion in the world that played a blackcore musician Dianisio A. Lind, who was 18 years ago, moved to a larger carilion in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriver said he was not replaced in St. Martin's Church.
What happened in St. Martin's Church in the past few months was a complex story between the architects and the subducers, some of whom were attracted by the false leaders of the church, others by the Eparchian.
The eastern of the believers, the leadership of the arrival body, consisting of the chaplain associates, said in July, with warning that the eryphia “treats to convey expenses” to a meeting of believers, although the meeting was not participating in the hiring of architects and subsequents sent by the erphology.
Some arrival complained of the absence of transparency by the Eparchian.
The shark wounded a 13-year-old boy during the duning to catch lobsters in California.
Saturday the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was hunting lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the season of the lobsters' catch.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. at the Beach of Bacon Beach in Encinites.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV to San Diego that Saturday morning he was working on a duning with his friends for half an hour when he heard the boy screaming, asking for help, and then sailed with the rest to help pull him out of the water.
At first, Hamel thought that it was just an excitement for the lobsters, but then he realized that something wrong happened, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"All of his key was ripped," said Hamel, adding that he noticed it when he approached the boy.
I shouted everyone to go out of the water, "The water is near the shark!", said Hamel.
The boy was transported by air to Raidi's child hospital to San Diego, where he's in critical state.
The diversity of the shark that attacked is unknown.
The Savior Captain Larry Giles said to the media briefing that the shark was noticed in this place a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that it was a safe variety.
Giles added that the victims had been injured by the top of the party.
The reasons have closed the beach approaches from Ponta Beach in Cassablad to Swama in Esinitas for 48 hours to investigate and for security.
Giles said that there are more than 135 shark species in this area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to advance to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's going to work with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams, opening up the divisions with beauty products in universities where specialists will work.
In the context of a considerable promotion of the British beauty market of 2,8 billion pounds of sterling, which continues to grow, while the volumes of sale of fashion clothing and household products are declined, more major beauty houses will be presented in 11 salons around the country and also in other new salons in the next year, showing success.
Beautiful investments come because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill a place on the police that were previously busy with television, microwave caves and house stores.
Sainsbury's said that it would double the amount of beauty goods, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Paw, which would appear for the first time.
The existing award from L'Oreal, Mordalline and Burt's Bees will also be given more room in firm departments like that that you can find in stores like boots.
Big shops also restart their Boutique cosmetics line, so most of the products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is getting more demanded among young buyers.
Besides, the Fragrance Shop shop will test the concesion in the two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croiden in southern London, and the second will be opened in Sali Oak (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Shopping online and going to buy small foods every day in local shops around the house leads to the supermarkets have to make more effort to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Cooper, the Executive Director of Sainsbury's, said that trade points would be more like university because the network of supermarkets is trying to compete with Aldi, Lidl, using a large number of services and retail goods.
Sainsbury's placed the trading points of Argos in hundreds of shops, as well as placed several points of Habitats since two years ago acquired both networks, which, he said, contributed to the growth of sale of food and made acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt of supermarkets to reconstruct their beauty and appointments failed successfully.
Sainsbury's protested a joint company from Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to divide income from the medication stores ended after a series of seizures in supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after three years ago Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business together with 281 shop Celesio owner of Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds of sterlings.
It was declared that Lloyds played his role in this plan, extending the luxurious brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Heeks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said, "We have changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our clients.
We also invested in training our employees who can offer our recommendations.
Our brands are designed with any need, and the attractive environment and the comfortable place make us a better beauty home that resists the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones went off after Holly Willowby gave up a deal for 11 million pounds of sterlings.
The star of Dragons Den Peter Jones was scattered after Holly Wheelovby's television broken down for 11 million pounds of sterlings from his brand, which specializes in the image of life to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
There's no time for a brand of goods for the house and accelerators True.
Business pairs became like a brand of Guinea Paulter Goop.
This morning, the 37-year-old leader announced to Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby left the star of Dragon's Den Peter Jones, who is now breaking up with her profit business on making brand clothes to focus on its new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources report that Jones was agitated when the golden girl of television confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow (Bakingemshire), that her new transactions were up to 1.5 million pounds of sterlings means that she would no longer have enough time to deal with household goods and accessors of the Truly brand.
Business was like a brand of Guinea Paulter Goop, and it was double-increased to double the prosperity of Willowby in 11 million pounds of sterlings.
When 37-year-old Willowbi announced to Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones flew out of Britain and went to one of his homes rest.
The source said, "Truly was Holly's main priority."
It appeared her long-term future, which she saw in a few decades.
Her decision to refuse left all the participants absolutely shocked.
Nobody wanted to believe what was going on Tuesday, and it was very soon to have dinner started.
Marlow headquarters have a warehouse full of goods ready to sell.
Experts suggest that the care of the leading this Morning, which includes the most significant British stars, could cost millions of companies because of enormous investments in different goods -- from pillows and candles to clothes and households, and because of possible further delays with their implementation.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of Trich Willowby and husband Dan Boldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Cape for ten years.
Willowbi founded True & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the Chairman's post in March.
A couple rest together, and Jones owns a 40-percent part in the Boldwin TV firm.
Willowbi will be a representative of the M&S Brand and replace Aunt McPartlin as the leading ITV.
Last night, a source near Jones said, "We won't comment on his case."
Honest conversation, "after we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism that he received from the media for his comments that were considered "nepresidency" because he was positive about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump deny a lot of things?
Tramp said in his so-called "dictor" voice.
"I do not deny anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Tramp as a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations came to an end.
Three months after the June Summit in Singapore, the North Korea Diplomat Lee Anne Ho announced the world leader at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North was not expected by the “suitable Wests” of the United States in response to the previous steps of North Korea in the area of disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to use sanctions to maintain pressure.
The tramp took a much more optimistic position in his speech.
"We are very successful in building relationships with North Korea," he said.
"Everything could end with North Korea's war.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have good bonds."
He said that his efforts to improve their relationship with Kim had brought positive results: completion of missile trials, helping to release hostages and returning the remains of American troops home.
And he defended his unusual approach in the conversation of Kim.
"By the president's side is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this overwhelmed arena, we're already going to have about 200 people," Tramp said, pointing the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and Indonesia's earthquake have destroyed the islands, hundreds of people killed.
For example, after the w. Lambhock earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations said they were unnecessary.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lamboc population were moved, no national disaster was announced, which is an essential condition to provide international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not looking for international assistance, so it was a little difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although the "Save the Children" Foundation and collects a team to go to Palo until it understands whether foreign employees can work in place.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the National Agency for Stuff Disaster, said that Indonesian officials assess the situation in Palo to find out whether international agencies would be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite earthquakes that always experienced Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for the surprises of nature.
While the Oceas had built shelters, in other coastal settlements they were almost none.
The apparent lack of siren to warn the tsunami in Paul led to a larger number of victims, although the warning was.
Even in the best times, the movement between Indonesian many islands was a difficult challenge.
And the spiritual disasters complicated the movement logistics.
The hospital ship, which was located on the w. Lamblock to treat the victims of the earthquake, is approaching Palo, but the way to the new place of disaster will take at least three days.
President Jocques Widoda focused his pre-electoral company on improving Indonesia's destroyed infrastructure and spent money on car roads and railways.
But the lack of finance has been persecuted by Jocques' administration because next year there will be new choices.
Mr. Jocca also faces the pressure of long inter-religion tension in Indonesia, where Muslims are taking more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes when the Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting on the streets, using catettes, ports and shots and other cold weapons.
Look, Daniel Starige from Liverpool pushes a ball far against Chelsea
Daniel Starig saved Liverpool from Chelsea's Play in Premier Liza, comparing the number for 89th minute on Saturday in Stemford Bridge in London.
The old man got a transfer from Gerdan Shakira when they were about 30 meters from the Chair of Chelsea, which led to number 1-0.
He made a sword left of himself before to make a shot in a distant stack.
The attempt ended by killing high under the top bar when the ball flyed to the top right corner of the net.
So the ball flyed over the head of the Arisabalago Cape, which jumped directly into the network.
"He was just trying to get into this position to push the ball, and players like Shak were always trying to push as far as possible forward, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible," said the Stariage at the Liverpool FC.com website.
"I saw that the Cante run, made a light pass, without thinking too much about it, and just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1:0 at the beginning of the second time after Belgian star Eden Azar killed at the 25th minute.
Attacking "Blue" in this game made a post of Mattea Kovačić before returning to the semi-defense zone and running half the Liverpool field.
The cowboy quickly found himself in the center of the field.
Then he did an effective stroke by handing the ball to the Azar on the gate.
Azar circled the defenseman and stuck into the bottom left corner at the bottom of the stangi by the Liverpool warrant.

The police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after they slaughtered a woman.
The murder investigation was launched after this morning in Birkenhed (Mersiside) was found by a woman's body.
44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with a massive injury in the neighborhood of Grayson-Muise on the street of John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police called for their people from this area who saw or heard anything.

I also invite everyone, especially cabs, video recorders who may have taken some videos, to contact us, because they may have information that is very important to our investigation."
The police rapporteur confirmed that a woman whose body was found lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own house.
Today, a woman's friend came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigations are continuing, and the police said it's in the process of informing the nearest victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Muse was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police told him no one was allowed to enter or get out of the building.
He lost his tongue when he found out what happened.
The inhabitants now say it'll take a few hours before they get back.

The parliamentary statue of Cromwell became the last centuries' stroke in the "Rewrite of History".
His removal would be a poetical justice for his similar to Taliban's destruction of many cultural and religious artificials of England, made by his fanatical puritanian followers.
"But the Cromwell Company described Mr. Creek's proposal as "bullshit" and "Try to overwrite history."
John Goldsmith, the chairman of Cromwell's Company, said, "In the course of the current debate on the demonstration of the statue was inevitable that the monument of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace will be the subject of these actions.
The Iconship of English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the poor Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The bright presentation of Mr. William Ham Thornicroft about Cromwell is a testimony of the 19th century's thought and part of the history of the act, which, as many believe, must be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: "Mnogy people know Cromwell from the end of the 19th century better than today as a parliament defender against external pressure, in his case it was monarchy.
Is this a completely precise presentation, a subject of long-term historical debates.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually distinguished figure that represents one of the sides of this struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to note and respect them."
The pig-slayer disappointed a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in the southwest of China.
"The man known only by the name -- Juan, was found dead with a broken arterial and surplus bleeding, next to the beach in the Lupańshi market in the province of Gujjjjov," reported the South China Post Sunday.
The pig was prepared to introduce a vaccine with pig into the pig on 30 May 2005 in Sinin in the Chinese province of Cynghai.
It is reported that he and his cousin on Wednesday came from the neighbouring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door of the neighbouring pig was open.
He said that in the pig there was a great bowl with blood on his nose.
According to the report, the Court's Medical Expert confirmed that a farmer was detained by a 550-kilogram bench.
"My cousin's legs were covered and damaged," said a cousin named Wu (as quoted by Guiyang Evening News).
The video recording from the observation camera showed that Juan went to the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man wasn't belonging to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager reported the Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent an attack on anyone else, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
According to messages, Juan's family and the market administration are talking about compensation for his death.
Although when pigs attack people, they're rare, but they've been before.
Yes, in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, which resulted in serious traumas.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 650 pounds of weight pressed the Valian farmer to its tractor and kept it until his wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoby said CBC News that pigs weren't usually aggressive but the taste of blood could act as a desert.
"They're just playing.
They're cruel and very questionable... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You should just give them the right amount of respect," he said.
The remains of the rose enemy will bring strong rains to the southwest of the United States.
According to the forecast, the rose hurricane is weaker because it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the next days Rosa will bring floods in northern Mexico and south-west of the United States.
Rosa's speed, the hurricane 1 category, was 85 miles/hour at 5 o'clock in the eastern time on Sunday, and it was fixed 385 miles south-west of Punta Euchenia in Mexico.
"Rose" is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific is beginning to form a low pressure area moving east to the west coast of the United States. If Monday Rosa approaches the Single California as a tropical storm, it will start pushing a deep tropical moisture to the north, southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring in some parts of Mexico to 10 inches of falls.
Then the tropical moisture, which interacts with the invading area of low pressure, in the nearest days, will cause strong lions in the southwest.
In places from 1 to 4 inches of falls, the dangerous sudden floods, land flows, and the possibly hollows in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to the number of spots that will reach two or three inches per hour, especially in some areas of Southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially in the largest part of Arizona, it is expected from 2 to 4 inches of fall.
Because of the disgrouped tropical rain parts, a sudden flood is possible when conditions are rapidly deteriorated.
It would be very unwanted to go to the desert walk because of the possibility of a threat of tropical falls.
A strong rain can lead to the storms of horses to raining rivers, and the rain will be followed by a spectacular wind and dust.
The arriving area of low pressure will bring a strong rain on the coast of South California.
Possible surprising falls more than half inch can lead to a small flow of trash and make slippery roads.
It'll be the first swim in the rain season.
Some dissolved tropical rains will start to come close to Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday before the rain goes everywhere at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rain will be spreading in the neighborhood of four corners on Tuesday and going on to Wednesday.
In October, there can be strong temperatures in the U.S. because the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropicals remain pretty warm.
Sometimes it leads to a drastic temperature change soon.
There's a good example of sudden temperature changes in the U.S. center in Sunday.
Among Kansas City, Missouri, and Amahai, Nebraska, St. Luisam and DeMoinem, Ayowa, the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
For the next few days long summer warmth will try to increase and expand again.
In many central and eastern states, the U.S. is expected to start a warm October with 80 degrees temperature -- from the South East to the part of the North East.
Temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates the high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern part of the United States by October 1:30.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cawan's hearing.
More than 20 million people on six television networks looked at interesting witnesses on Thursday in the Supreme Court on the case between Brett Cavan and Christine Blacey Ford, who accused him of sexual violence, which was supposed to have happened in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continues, the boarders interrupted their regular programs for emergency news on Friday: an agreement designed by Arizonan Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it was a weekly investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senatic Court Bureau that she was 100 percent confident that the drunk Cavanah caught her and tried to get her clothes off at the high school party.
In his hot testimony, Qovana said that 100% was sure that it wasn't.
More than 20.4 million people who Nelsen reported on Friday were looking at him.
The company calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data were not available immediately for other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And the Nelsen company usually has a problem with the evaluation of people who look at television in office.
For comparison: the public size is the same as when playing playoff or Oscar's prize.
"The Fox News Canal, whose experts strongly supported the appointment of Cavan, managed all networks of 5,69 million viewers throughout the day," said Nelsen.
ABC took a second seat with 3.26 million audiences.
"CBS had 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.2 million," said Nelsen.
The interest remained high and after the hearing.
Flake was the main figure of the Drama Friday.
After the cabinet of the moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote in support of Cavan, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when the protesters screamed at his address and if he was trying to rise up on the elevator at a hearing in the Court Bureau.
He was standing with his eyes scratched for a few minutes when he was beaten, and it was transmitted in the direct air on the CNN channel.
"I stand right here before you," said one woman.
'Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?'
He was told, "You have power, but many women are free of it."
Flake said that his office published the statement, and told him before the elevator closed that he had something to say at the hearing in the bureau.
All cable and satellite networks have been running a broadcast for a few hours when the Court's Bureau had to vote on the issue of the selection of Quanne's candidature at the Senate Quarter.
But Flake said that he would do that, just knowing that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, which the democrats call on the minority.
Flake was convinced by a partial conversation with his friend, Senator Democrat Chris Kuns.
After a conversation with Kuns and a few Senators, Flake made a decision.
The choice of Flake had power because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Cavanaugh without investigation.
President Tramp started an investigation against Cwana in the FBI.
Mae Prime Minister of Great Britain accuses the criticism of the "Game in Policy" because of the Brexit
During the interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused the criticism that she planned to leave the European Union, that they were "going to politics" with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain, Teresa May, arrived at the Conference of the Conservative Party in British Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In one of the interviews next to her on the first page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, who spoke against her as the so-called "idiotic" plan on the bexcite, saying that the suggestion was that Britain and the EC had the only tariffs, was "usually absurd".
The police arrested the suspect of the LSU Dayteon Simpson's death.
The police arrested a suspect of a fatal shooting at Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketballist from the Louisian University team.
"The 20-year-old Daytaon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison for second-step murder," said the Baton Rouge Police Guide.
The reasons showed a shooting video between Simm and Simpson, and the police said that Simms lost his glasses during the shooting.
"The police took the glasses from the scene and said they found the DNA of Simpson," WAFB, CBS branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said that he confessed to a death shot at Wade.
"The bet cost is set at $350,000," says Advocate.
The latter office of Eastern Botton Rose published a previous report on Friday, saying that the cause of death was a firewound in the head and neck.
The Department of the Operational Police Department of Louisiana, the Criminal Police Lab, the Southern University Police Prosecutors of the District of Investigation, which would contribute to arrest.
The sports director of the Louisian University, Joe Aleva, thanked the law enforcement authorities of the area for “authority and striving for justice”.
Sims was only 20 years old.
As he grew up, he grew 6 feet in Baton Rose, where his father Wayne was also playing basketball for the Louisian University team.
In the middle of the past season, he's got 5.6 points, 2.6 game sets.
On Friday morning, a basketball team trainer at the Louisian University, Will Wade said that the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" from Wade's death.
"That's what I'm always worried about," Wade said.
Vulcan explodes ashes in Mexico
The ashes exposed by the Papacathepetle volcano has reached the south of Mexico capital.
The National Centre for Stuff Disaster Warning on Saturday offered the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and for 24 hours 183 cases of gas and ashes were registered.
In the center there was a hearing loudness and felt a shock.
The pictures in social networks have shown that in Mexico's circles, such as Secimila, there are thin layers of pope covering on a car wind glass.
Geophics noticed the increase in volcano activity, located 45 miles (72 miles) from the south-east capital after the magnetous earthquake of 7.1 in the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Confronting the police with catalan separatists on the day of the voting anniversary for independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested after the advocates of independence encountered the police in public order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration in notifying the first polarizing voting anniversary in Catalonia.
A group of separatists in masks, which were restrained by the police in public order, bashed them with eggs and blossed with powder paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, the fights exploded when the police used their oaks to sustain the demonstrators.
During a few hours of fighting independence groups that scanned "Don't forget, don't forgive," they encountered the present trade union actors who screamed: "Live Spain."
According to the local press, fourteen people have been treated with small injuries received during the protest action.
The tension in the region that strikes to independence remains high a year after October 1's referendum, which Madrid recognized as illegal but noted by the Catalonic Separatists.
The voters preferred independence, though the voters were low, which was largely explained by the voting motion.
According to the Catalan authorities, in the summer, nearly 1,000 people were injured after the police tried to stop voting in the electoral stations around the region as a result of the action of angry demonstrators.
Independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations from supporting Spanish national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters had to go in another way.
68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electrician who is present at a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for the prospects of achieving Catalonia's independence.
"We've been through one of the best moments this summer.
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we're tired," he said.
Despite the vital, but slight victory in the regional elections in December last year, the catalan parties who act for independence have tried to keep the impulse this year with many of their most famous leaders and have ended up either in a voluntary exile or in prison, waiting for a court for a referendum and the next announcement of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanist, Joan Pooch, who recorded a protest in support of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by politics on both sides.
"It's going to be more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junkeros, one of the nine Catholic leaders, who are in CISA since the end of the last year, announced that they would participate in the European Parliament's elections next year.
"Electing as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic preciousness and repressions that we have seen by the government of Spain," he said.
Londoners: The men are arrested after they scattered the house on the car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39 years, were arrested after their car interrupted in a house in London.
The incident took place in Belinogard Crescent's neighborhood on Thursday around 7:30 by British.
Detective inspector Bob Blammings said it was damaged by the gate and the building itself.
Perhaps at some point the car had a bullet.
As a result of the blow of Meng Levingston, he wins Rangers with number 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Mangi for Levingstan has provided them with victory
Success of Levingston shocked Rangers, and it was enough to appoint Steven Gerard after him several losses in 18 games at the Ibrox club manager's position.
The blow of Dolly Mangy was great because Gary Holt rised up to one level with Hibernian in the second division.
Gerard's team won't win this season and next Sunday meet the leaders, the Harts team, which stands at eight points.
By this time, Rangers takes the Rapid Vienna on Thursday in Europe.
Levingston, meanwhile, continued his playless series in the division to six games, and the chief coach Holt still defeated after Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Levingstan misss the chance because of rough visitors
Holt's team was supposed to be in front of a long time before they killed, but that's the direction of Rangers' calls.
Scott Robinson broke out, but he lost his chance to kill at the gate, and then Alan Litg only managed to guide his efforts wider to meet Craig Hulkett.
The hosts were pleased to allow Rangers to play before them, knowing that they can disturb the guests at some point.
And that's how the main goal was achieved.
The Rangers had been released, and Levingston sent a debate, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined in to overcome Menga, which was posted and killed from the center of the field.
Until that moment "Rangers" was dominated, but it turned out that the protection of the team was inappropriate, and Liam Kaley's locker was practically not activated
The same thing was going on in the afternoon, although Alfred Morrelas really saved Kali.
The ball from Scott Pittman was reflected by the Reingers Recorder Alan McGregor, and Lithuanian was far away from the second Livingstan network.
The balls were constantly caught at the Levingston Gate and were stabbed, while two toolbar requirements, after Halketa was called to replace Glen Middleton, and the penalty for the game with the hand, were rejected.
“Fenomen” of Levingstan — Analysis
Journalist BBC Scotland Alessday Lamont at Arena Tony Macaroni
Fenomenal productivity and results for Levingstan.
For men they were wonderful, continuing excellent expectations on this outgoing trajectory.
Their style of game and storage almost changed since their return to the highest eschelon, but we should give the appropriate Holt for how he stimulated the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halckett was great, exploding well organized protection, while Mengo kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall everywhere in the field.
Rangers didn't get an inspiration.
Whatever good they were at Gerard, they disagreed with that standard.
In the last ball they didn't own, but once killed at the gate, which was something like anxious call for Rangers, which was found in the middle of the list.
Mixed Treatment to Erdogan in Kölne
Saturday, on September 29, smiles were seen, and there were irregular flies when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdagan to Germany, which is directed to renew the relationship between NATO allies.
They argued with human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EC.
Erdagan went to Kölne to open a new giant ball.
This town has the largest number of Turkish populations outside Turkey.
The police were rescued to a security assurance so as to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the ball, but a lot of advocates gathered around here to see their president.
A hundreds of protesting against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both the politics of Erdogan and the decision of the Government of Germany to welcome him in the country.
The protests for and against reflect the disputes of a guest, whom some German Turks declared a hero, and others were convicted as a author.
DTZ in Deptford: A bike died when he struggled with a car
A bikeman died as a result of a car encounter in London.
The accident occurred about the crossing of the streets of Bestud and Evelyn Street, the highway in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about at 10:15 in British times.
The driver stopped, the medicinalists arrived, but the man died still.
The accident occurred a few months after another bikeman died as a result of a struggle at Chilenders Street, about a mile from the Saturday crash site.
The steady police stated that their employees are working on identifying a man and reporting about his nearest relatives.
In addition to that, road gardens and bus stops were located, and the car driver was recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: Six employees were injured during a mess
"Six prison officials have been injured as a result of a strict regime in prison," reports the Penitencial Administration.
The riots exploded in the Long Lartin prison in Woostershire around 9:30 by British time on Sunday and continues before.
In order to combat the mess that are involved in the same wing of eight prisoners, a Tornado special group was attracted.
At the scene, workers were treated with minor traumas.
The representative of the Penitencial Service said: "The specially trained prison personnel was directed to combat those who had committed a mess in the Long Lartin prison.
Six employees were treated after getting a trauma.
We will not endure violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the guilty will be transferred to the police and can spend more time outside the retina."
The Royal Long Lartin prison contains more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, a prison chief was being treated in a hospital after the prisoner was attacked.
And in October last year, the police officers were called to prison to deal with serious mess, during which the workers were attacked with balls for the waterpool.
Rosa's hurricane threatens the city of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong floods (which may be useful for dry regions)
Trapical enemy rarely occurs in Arizona, but this is exactly what can happen in the beginning of the next week, because there are traces of the Roose enemy in the south-western part of the desert, which forms a risk of sudden floods.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Meteorological Service published information on sudden floods in West Arizona and south and eastern Nevada, South Eastern California and Ute, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Los Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will go through Phoenix on Tuesday, near the rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “the only ten tropical cyclones brought a tropical storm or a down pressure within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
"Catrina" (1967) was an enemy of 40 miles from the border with the state of Arizona."
The last model of the National Centre of enemy is the decline of two to four inches, and in separate places, the level can reach six inches in the area of Magalon in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basein, it is likely to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with individual results can reach 4 inches.
For those outside the limits of the sudden flood, the rose hurricane could be long-expected, because their region suffers from drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, some of these falls are likely to be useful, because the drought is now observed in the southwest.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Agency, at least a slightly more than 40 percent of the Arizona Territory experienced an extreme drought of another category," weather.com reported.
First of all, the way of the hurricane Rosa leads to accommodation on the Mexican half of California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of the hurricane with the maximum wind 85 miles per hour in 385 miles south of Punta Euchenia in Mexico, and moving north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm faces colder waters in the Pacific and then it's quiet.
So it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm comes, a river exits from the shore of the day or the evening on Monday.
Falls in various parts of Mexico can be strong, which will create a significant risk of diving.
"The total number of falls from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to north-western Sanlara, where possible falls up to 10 inches," said the weather.com.
Then the rose will move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the borders of Arizona early in Tuesday morning as a tropical turmoil, which will then continue through Arizona and the south of the Utah state to Tuesday night.
"The main danger is expected from the "Rose" or its remains, it is very strong rain in the Lower California and the northwest of Sanori and the Southwestern Desert of the United States," reported the National Centre of Urban.
These rains are expected to lead to dangerous lives and sudden floods and rural streams and crawls in the mountains.
Attack to Midsomer Norton: Four attempts to arrest murderers
Three teenager boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested under suspicion of attempting to kill after a 16-year-old body with a lot of injuries to Summerset.
Three teenager boys were found injured in the area of Terrace Excelsier in Midsomer Norton about 4 hours Saturday.
He was delivered to a hospital where he remains in a stable state.
"A 17-year-old boy and both others, 18 and 20 years old, were arrested at night in the area of Redstock, Avon and Summerset," police said.
The police contacted anyone who could have any evidence on the mobile phone what happened to move forward to their searches.
"Cavono occupies from anger and anger of the Democratic Party," said Tramp.
"The voting for Judge Cavano is a vote for the abolition of the vulnerable and ruthless tactic of the Democratic Party," said Tramp at the Wiling, East Virginia.
Tramp stated that Cavano is "patient from anger and anger" of the Democratic Party in the course of his selection process.
Cavanaugh gave indications before Congress on Thursday, intense and emotionally denying Cristina Blacey Ford's accusations that he sexually violated her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave a testimony during the hearing of her accusation.
On Saturday, the President said that "the Americans saw a brilliant, quality and courageous nature" Cavano.
"The voice in support of Judge Cavano is a voice for one of the most perfect experts in the field of the right of our time, a lawyer with a great story of state service," he said, "the crowd of Western Virginia's followers.
The president directed the selection of Cavano, talking about the importance of the Republicans during the period of interim elections.
"Five weeks left to one of the most important choices of our time.
I'm not just late, but I'm really late," he replied.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
The tramp is disagreeable that the Democrats intend to "confront and prevent."
"The first key-processing vote at the senate level of the selection of Kavano is expected to take place not later than Friday," said CNN senior parliamentary assistant.
Hundreds of people were killed as a result of earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims grows
"A least 384 people were killed, many disappeared as a result of a giant wave in the beach when the Indonesian island of Sulavesa began a major earthquake and tsunami," stated the authorities on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered together at the beach Festival in the town of Palo on Friday, when waves were 6 meters high (18 feet) fighting about the shore in the darkness, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
Following the magnitude earthquake, 7.5 happened to tsunami.
"When a tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't immediately escape, and they became victims," said the Briefing in Jackarta, a press secretary of the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of Disasters, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
"The tsunami dragged cars, dried, houses, hitting everything about the ground," Nugroho said, adding that tsunami passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (to 497 km/h) before the shore line struck.
He said that some people survived only because they climbed the trees to escape from tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in the 24 Paul center.
The aerofotografies published by the Stuff Disaster Agency showed that many buildings and stores were destroyed, the bridges were rotating and laying down, and the ball was surrounded by water.
The next strikes continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes took place in the area of 2,4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Technology Use (BPPT) stated that the energy generated by a strong earthquake on Friday is approximately 200 times higher than the power of the nuclear bomb that was thrown on Hiroshim in World War II.
According to his data, the geographic of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of tsunami.
Nugroch called the damage "wide" and reported that thousands of houses, hospitals, trade centres and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found under fractures of ruined buildings, adding that 540 people had been wounded, and 29 were lost without news.
"The arrogance and pity can be greater along the coast line of 300 miles (190 miles) north of Palo, the area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake," Nugroha said.
The relationship with Dongal was "completely damaged," said Nugroch.
"There are more than 300 000 people," says the Red Cross statement, adding that his employees and volunteers were sent to the injured neighborhoods.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been a lot worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting tsunamis in Paul, but the officials stated that the waves were coming while a warning was made.
In amateur photos published in social networks, you can hear a man on the top of the building desperately screaming people on the street of warning about coming tsunami.
In a few minutes the wall of water fell on the coast, dragging buildings and cars behind them.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the validity of the removed material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power shutdown that violated communications around Paul, so the government was difficult to remember rescue.
According to the authorities, the soldiers began to run cargo planes using Jackarta and other cities, but the evacuated one still really needed food and other elements of the first need.
The city's airport was opened only to provide assistance and would be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Jocques Video planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palo.
As a result of tsunami in Indonesia, more than 800 people lost
It's very bad.
"While World Vision staff from Dungala successfully reached the city of Paul, where the workers hide in the brizent hiding places installed at the court of their office, on the road they saw the scene of desolation," said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when a group of help has started a dark launch of disaster help mechanisms, some have complained that foreign workers who have deep notices are preventing them from going to Palo.
According to the Indonesian rule, financing, delivery, and personnel outside the borders can only begin if the disaster site is announced by a national disaster zone.
That's not what happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we will be able to open for international assistance, but this status is not yet.
On the second night in Palo, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of missing without news hoped that their close miracles would be among those who would leave the unreasonable story lines of the stiff disasters.
Saturday the little boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue officers released a woman who was two days under ruins, and next to her, the body of her child.
Hendon Subandon, coach of the Indonesian National Team on Paraplanerism, prepared two of the missing paraplans for Asian games that were completed at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped in Roa Roa Roa's hotel, were his disciples.
"It is the senior in a paraplanerism branch I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told you as a few hours after the news of the destruction of Roa Roa Roa Roa was spread among the communities of paraplanetists, he was desperately sending messages to the WhatsApp participants of the Palu, who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with one gray slipper instead of two blue.
"This means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole 26,750 dollars while filling banks in Newport on Levi
"The thieves stolen 26,750 dollars in Friday morning from a Brink employee, who was building banknotes in Newport in Libya," reports the Newport Police Department's press release.
"The car driver dropped a bankmat in a fun complex and prepared to deliver more money," wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the program.
As long as he was busy, another man " ran out of Brink's employee," and stole a fur with money intended for delivery.
According to the message, witnesses noticed several suspects who left the scene, but the police did not specify the number of incidents.
Anyone who has information about them should contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Caney West: Repper changes its name to Ye ("y").
Reper Kaney West changes its name to Ye.
When he announced a name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, I'm officially known as Kaney West.
West, 41-year-old Ye, used this name as a name for his eighth album, which came out in June.
Changes happen before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he expected to run his new album Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande's singing by a show that has changed for "emotional reasons," said the author of the show.
As a result of reducing his current professional name West earlier said that this word was religious to him.
I believe that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is "ye," West said early this year, discussing the name of the Big Boy Radio.
So I am you, I am us, all this is us
This came from Kaney, which means "one" to just Ye" -- the reflection of our good, our bad, our destruction, the whole.
Album is more reflective of who we are.
He's one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was in a different way known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he was inclined to the names of Love and Brother Love.
Former West's employee, Jay-Ze, also did no connection or head letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use the army against peaceful residents
The election president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Abrador never uses military force against civilian population because the country is approaching the 50s of the day of bloody reppressions against students.
On Saturday at the Square Tlatelolco Plaza Lopez Abrador's "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration on the Square, resulting from about 300 deaths, while the left student movements were scattered throughout Latin America.
Lopez Abrador went through to support young Mexicans, issueing monthly grants to students, opening more free places at state universities.
"Young people are attracted to criminal groups, and the lack of educational opportunities," he said.
U.S. must double the engine-intelligence finance
"As China becomes increasingly active in the field of machine intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend for research in this area," says the investor and engineer intelligence specialist Kai-Fu Lee who worked in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came up after various parts of the US government made statements about MI, even if there is no U.S.'s official M.M. Strategy.
In the meantime, last year, China presented its plan: by 2030, it's trying to be the first innovation in the MI.
"The combining of the budget for research in the area of MY would be a good start, given that all other countries are standing away from the United States, and we expect the next breakthrough in the MI area," Lee said.
"The coupling of funding may double the probability that the next major achievement of the MI will be achieved in the United States," stated Lee at the CNBC in this week's interview.
Lee, whose book The Power of Machine Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month in Hotton Mifflin Harcurt, is the chief Executive Director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most famous MI companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, he was working on a machine intelligence system at the University of Carnegie-Melan, which won the most highly emitted American Athelle player, and later he was the chief of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Department of Google in China.
Lee acknowledged the previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency's Robote Technology for a Good Research Project in the field of defence, and asked if the next would be to help identify the following viewers.
"The U.S. researcher often has a lot of work to get government grants," said Lee.
"It's not China that takes away academic leaders; it's corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have recently hired lights from the Universitys for M.I.
Lee said that change in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"In my opinion, green cards should be automatically offered by the candidate in the MI branch," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued an engineering plan for the next generation.
"The National Fund for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people in educational institutions, just as the National Scientific Fund and other state organisations allocate money to US researchers, but the quality of the academic work in China below," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry created an U.S. Centre of Machine Intelligence, in which partners from industrial and scientific wheels should be involved, and the White House announced the creation of the Machine Intelligence Special Bureau.
And this month, the Agency for Final Research Project in the Defense Area announced investments of $2 billion, called AI Next.
As to the National Scientific Organization (NSF), it is currently investing more than 100 million dollars a year in the MI study.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that was trying to create the National Intelligence Commission has not been observed for months.
Macedonians vote at a referendum about the country's name change
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum to change their name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, allowing us to resolve a ten-year argument with Greece, which blocked the European Union's requests for participation.
Greece, who has Macedonian province, claims that her northern neighbour's name is a claim to her territory, and put a veto to the NATO and EC.
In June, both governments made a deal with the proposed new name, but nationalists argue that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slovenian population.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in a referendum, and the baycott company questioned whether the voters would meet the minimum of 50 percent necessary to conduct a referendum.
The voting question on the referendum suggests: "You are for membership in NATO and EC with a agreement with Greece."
A change of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claims that this is a cost worth paying for acceptance to bodies like the EC and NATA of Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared in the sub-Saturn of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the countries, for young people in Macedonia, so they could live freely under the European Union's egoide, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievski, 79, Skopje.
Although this is not an obligatory legal force, the number of members of Parliament said that they would take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
Rename requires more than two thirds of the parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that there were no violations from 1 hour of the day.
However, the emission was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to voting for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old elector at the capital of Skopje Jose Tanewski.
The premier of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zariza and his son Dush voted for a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to a change in the name of the country, which opens the way for her entry into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Cavardark, 54, prepared a small scene and layed chairs in front of tents set by those who would play a referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to merger with the heads raised instead of through the official door," said the Kawadarks.
"We are a poor country, but we have the honour.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can contact others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that the NATA friendship would bring necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment level was more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the large number will be "for" because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATA," said Zayov after the vote.
He said that the result of "yes" would be "the confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Surveys, a referendum says that 30 to 43 percent of the voters are involved in the elections, which is below the necessary emission.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's television showed 57 percent of the surveys planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they voted "yes".
In order to make a successful referendum, the efficiency must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure in the referendum will be the first serious strike in the past government's policy since its arrival in May last year.
See Sergeya Aguera from Manchester City goes to the gate through all the protection of Bryton
On Saturday, Sergio Aguera and Rahim Sterling solved the problem with protection against Bryton by the winning of Manchester City, number 2:0 at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
And at the 65th minute, Aguera easily did it.
The Argentine attacker got a post in the center of the field.
He raced between the three Brayton defenders before hitting the open field.
Then Aguera turned out to be among the four green shirts.
He walked around one defender and pipped a few more on the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed a pass on the left flank by finding Sterling.
The English attacked the first touch in the fined ball of Aguer, who used his right stroke to cross the Brian's locker Matthew Ryan in the right side of the network.
"Aguera has some problems with her feet," said the journalists, head of Pep Guardiolo's city.
"We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky that he killed the goal at the same moment."
But it's the Serling gave Sky Blue the initial advantage of fighting at the Primeer Lisa.
This goal took place for the 29th minute.
Aguera got this ball deep in the Bryton territory.
He sent the beautiful ball through the left flang to Lerrow Sune.
Sain made a few touches before Sterling could reach the farer stank.
The Sky Bluz attacked the ball before he jumped outside.

Shercer wants to play the role of "selecting points" against Rocky
After the Nationals were excluded from competitions in the playoff, there was no special reason to make a new start.
But constantly the contestant Shercer hopes to take a hit on Sunday against the Colorade of Rocky, but only when there will still be consequences of the playoff for Rocky, who remain in the leaders after one game with Los Angeles Dodgers in the Northwest.
The years conquered at least a single place with 5-2 over the nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their first title in the division.
"If we play just so, at least we can deal with the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team, will be so that the game will probably be at the highest level of all I've encountered this year.
Why don't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday, but reportedly they are inclined to give Shercer the ball in such a situation.
Sherther, who was going to do his 34st start, had a session on Thursday and would be on a regular leave on Sunday.

Tramp speaks in Western Virginia
The president directed the situation around his choice of the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, saying the importance of the Republicans in the interim elections.
"All we have done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the great, big -- I'm not late, I'm really late, so I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Tramp went on, "You see this horrible, horrible Democratic radical group, you see what's going on right now.
And they are determined to restore their powers, using any necessary means, you see, is the devil, the cruelty.
They don't care who they offend, whom they have to interrupt in order to get power and control, that's what they want, that's the power and control we're not going to give them."
He said that the democrats intend to “confront and prevent”.
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "wretched, vulnerable, contrary and liar."
He resurrected to the Senate Court Bureau on the still recognition of Senator of the Democratic Group of Diana Feinstein, who received a loud assessment from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you miss the passage of the document?
Uh-uh, what.
No, I don't expect it -- it was a very bad non-verbal language -- the worst language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer the core church.
It's anxiety to those who express their opinion
If the Momentum activists in my local party voted for injuring me, it was hardly a surprise.
Finally, I'm the last member of the parliament from the Lebarian Party who's said we're not welcomed -- everything to express my opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar reverse because she was decisively opposed to anti-semitism.
In my case, the censorship criticized me for disagreing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, is ironic about fate, like questions that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The meeting, held on Friday by the Nottingham East Lebarian Party, states that "we want these meetings to be placeable and productive."
During most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Lebarian Party exactly such meetings were on Friday
Unfortunately, today, most of the meetings are not the tone and the promise of the politics to be "worst, more soft" forgotten for a long time when it was ever.
It's getting more obvious that in the Lebarian party, different views are not accepted, and every opinion is estimated from that perspective, is it acceptable for the party leadership or not.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, because my colleagues, with whom I used to think I was dividing the same political views, began to expect me to take a step back, and they took positions that I wouldn't agree with -- on the issues of national security or on the single EU market.
Every time I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- in social networks, there's a tide of images that call for cancellation, condemning the centre policy, saying that I'm no longer in the Leibar Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I'm lucky more than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed to me are generally political.
I'm delighted in the professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who daily face the stream of sexual or racism but never avoid.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Leiborists Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, we're no longer an organization that has different views, and with every movement of "insecurity" or changing the rules of selection, the party is getting more narrow.
For the last two years, I was given a lot of advice that called me not to fall down, not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Leiborists 32 years ago as a school student, caused by precepting the government of Tatcher, for whom my school school student failed, I tried to support the best public services for those who needed them most -- let it be a local resident or government minister.
I never hid my political views, including in the past elections.
No one in Eastern Notingham could get involved in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who have struggled for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is heading towards Brexit, which is causing damage to the household, business and our state service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and strength to my loyalty to the Leiborist Lebarian Party.
But in fact the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my voters, whether they will be members of the Lebarians, or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to the cancellation of elections will be, and political consensus will prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Ire-Melrows 38-17: Invincible Ire on top
Two later attempts might have somewhat ended up, but, no doubt, Ayr earned a triumph in this remarkably interesting game of the Premier League of Tenant.
Now they're starting a tour table, one side of ten.
Finally, it was their highest protection, just as their best chances that made their masters, coach Peter Murphy had the right to be satisfied.
"We were still testing our games so far, and we are still invincible; so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christy from Melrows said, Give the proper Aira; he dared more than us.
The 14-minute attempt of Grant Anderson, converted by Fraiser Clime, put Ira in front, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, given for the Warriors game, allowed Melrowz to get a bunch of digits, and Jason Baggott grabbed for an unrealized attempt.
The climate stretched Ayra's leadership with the toolbar before, right at a break, he killed, and then made a solo attempt by making 17-5 Ayra break.
But Melrows well began the second half, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, converted by the Bogott, reduced departure to five points.
Then there was a long delay because of a serious trauma of Roorid Not, which was stretched up, and after the restart of Ayre progressed further through the attempt of Stafford McDowell, implemented by Climates.
Air, performing Captain Blair McFerson's duties, got a yellow card, and again Melrows made another man pay by using an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of February.
However, the landlords returned, and when Struan Hatchinson got a yellow card for the fact that he killed the Climate without the ball from the fine line, McFerson landed behind Ayra.
The climate implemented its attempt that had done again almost after the restart, after Kyle Row received a hit of David Armstrong in the fine and sent Gregor's flanger Henry to the fifth attempt of the masters of the field.
The Star Still Game seems ready for a new career in a restaurant business
Nevertheless, the star of the Ford Kieran game is going to enter a guest business industry after it turns out he was designed by the director of the licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show he writes and takes off with a long comedian partner Greg Hamfield.
Duet announced that the next ninth series would be the last in a series of show, and it seems that Kernan is planning to move on after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The acter refused to comment on the story, although the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kernan was hoping to participate in the "blooming trade in Glasgo".
"The sea of ours": Bolivia, who has no way to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The seamen are patroling the sea headquarters in La Pas.
Civil buildings are under the blue flag.
In the military-sea bases from the lake of Titicac to Amazon, the motto "More is our right."
Renewing is our duty.
In all Bolivia, who has no way to the sea, the memory of the coastal line lost Chile's bloody conflict because of the resources of the 19th century, is still alive -- like the effort to swim again across the Pacific.
These hopes may have reached the maximum top in the past decades, since Bolivia is expecting an international court's decision on October 1, after five years of discussion.
"Balivia has the impulse, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course she expects a positive result," said the Bolivian diplomat Robert Calsadillia.
Many of the Bolivians will be watching the MS decision on large screens around the country, hoping that the Tribunal in Gaaza after decades of tense conversions will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is obliged to discuss the provision of the sovereign exit of Bolivia to the sea.
Eva Morales is the charismatic president of Bolivia, who faces the opposite struggle for reelection next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he bothed at the end of August.
But some analysts think the court can hardly decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and that's little to change, even if it does.
The U.N., which is based in the Netherlands, has no right to decide on Chile's territory and said that it would not determine the origin of possible negotiations.
The conclusion of the International Court of Justice expires only six months after the final arguments have been considered, indicates that the issue was not "complicated", said the Chinese expert in the area of international law, Poz Zarate.
And far without promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have threw her back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Sarat said.
She said that the marales warrior lost the remaining chile's goodness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but then the debate will be very difficult.
Since 1962, two countries have not shared the messengers.
Former President of Edward Radrigues Welte, Bolivia's representative in Gaaza, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "exclusive opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "the ability to end 139 years of differences with mutual imagination," he said.
Calsadilla also denyed that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the marine problem as a political opposition.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The event is the opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not come until they can trust the U.S.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho says his country will never stop using his nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called upon the United States to carry out promises reached during the summit in Singapore between leaders.
His comments come as the United States, and the Secretary-General Mike Pampea seems to be on the border of the renewal of the nuclear tup diplomatic with North Korean Kim Chen Yen more than three months after Singapur.
Ri says that this is a "independent dream" that long sanctions and opposition to the United States against the declaration of the completion of the war in Korea have ever put North on their knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration when Phenyan first starts a significant disarmament step.
And Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, are looking for the second summit.
But there's a great scepticism about Phenyan being seriously rejected by the arsenal, which the country is likely to consider as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pampea plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tump Summit.
In Paris' fashion shows we saw the most new line in the massive main clothes on the way to the store in your cities
If you want to increase your hat collection or close the sun completely, you can no longer be searched.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a number of unusual main clothings for their SS19 collection, which exceeded the expectation of Paris Fashion Week.
This summer in Instagram, the popularity of non-practical hats, the designers sent their creatures to the floor.
The famous Valentino character was a luxury bench hat, decorated with wide fields like feathers filling the heads of the models.
Other accessors unusually large size included decorationed with precious stones of the café, the wizard hat, and even an ananas, but they were not intended to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also showed the collection of fake masks -- just to Halloween.
Many of the different colored masks were shaved with lips and more reminded of Hannibal Lecter than a high fashion.
One of them was like a swimming swimming swimming with a pipe and a protective shoe, and the other was like a swimmed ice cream.
And if you keep sticking to the huge fashion attributes, you're lucky.
Those watching the style predicts that enormous hats can break into our everyday life.
The enormous hats go to the fifths to the La Bomba, a slammed hat with a field wide, which can be seen in all, from Romana to Emily Rataikovski.
A kult label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was dissolved in social networks, contributed to another great creature on the floor -- a slammed beach bag, almost as large as a model with this bag dressed in a buyer.
The dark orange bag of the raphia, decorated by the raphia and covered with a white skin handle, became an excellent part of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection of the week of fashion in Paris.
The famous stylelist Luke Armitage said F.Š.A.: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, since the designer had a great influence, and it would be difficult to ignore demand for uncomfortable accessories."
John Edward: language learning is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
Independent schools of Scotland keep their achievements in the academic success, which is going on since 2018 with another excellent result of the examinations that are strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other communities.
Over 30,000 students across Scotland, schools presented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to ensure a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for the higher education they have chosen their career and their places as civilians of the world.
As a educational sector that can develop and evolve a individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandella said, "If you talk to a man in the language he understands, it remains in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
It's a bright reminder that we can't only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of the recent exams this year, we see the languages take first place in the league tables with the highest rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who were studying foreign languages received the A higher score.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of the students had reached a higher class A in the study of Chinese, while 72 percent were those who study German, 69 percent French, and 63 percent -- Spanish -- also reached level A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will certainly need children and youths in the future.
Now the languages as a subject are chosen as well as the subjects of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
An inquiry conducted by the Commission on Employment and British skills in 2014 showed that among the reasons that employers had caused difficulties in filling vacancies, 17 percent were linked to lack of language skills.
So more and more language skills become necessary to prepare young people for future career.
Given more prospective jobs that require language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter who chooses the profession when you learn a different language, it will become a real advantage in the future when you have these skills for your whole life.
The possibility of contacting people from other countries automatically put a multilingual person first among competitions.
According to YouGov's survey, in which more than 4,000 adult British were engaged in 2013, 75 percent have failed to speak in a foreign language enough to talk, and the French was the only language in which two-value interests were spoken -- 15 percent.
That's why investments in language learning are now important for modern children.
The presence of several languages, especially in developing countries, gives children more chances to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be different from the languages it teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for Britain in view of the future by 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with a teaching warehouse that is a specialist in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are trying to provide an environment that will cook children and arm them with skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of what will happen in the future.
Now you can't deny that in the global business environment the languages still have vital importance for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and preference for youths of Scotland.
It must be done
John Edward, director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron debuts on Sunday in San Diego
Starting waiting for followers who want to see Lebron James make his first start at Los Angeles Lakers.
Trainer Lekers Luke Walton announced that James was going to play a pre-season opening on Sundays against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes he'll play, yet to determine.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the Official Lakers website.
Correspondent Mike Trudell wrote that James would probably play in limited minutes.
According to this week's practice, James asked about his plans on the six pre-season graphs.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of career to prepare," he said.
Tramp's time in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight in Wiling, West Virginia, President Donald Tramp starts a lot of campaign stocks.
That's the first one of the five planned Tramps next week, including the stops in friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
In confirmation of the arrival arrival to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Tramp is trying to strengthen the support of the existing interim elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control over Congress when the votes are given in November.
When is Tramp's speech starting tonight in West Virginia, and how do you see it online?
Tramp's performance in Wiling (West Virginia), scheduled for 7 a.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Tramp's talk in West Virginia on the Internet below on YouTube.
Tramp is probably this week to consider hearing on the candidature to the Supreme Court of Breta Cavano, who has problems with the charges of sexual harassment with the expected confirmation in the Senate of votes for a week during the FBI investigation.
But the main goal of these speakers is to assist the Republicans, who stand before the election in November.
Thus, the President's company Tramp announced that these five were speaking next week to "activate volunteers and followers, since the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," reports Reuters.
"Control for Congress is so important for his order of day that the president will go to the maximum possible number of states, since we are entering a tense season of the pre-electoral company," said Rather's agency as a representative of Tramp's company.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wiling, today's action can attract followers from Agajo and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media of Pitzburg," reports the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Tramp visited West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help the candidate from the Western Virginia Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the surveys.
"It is not a very good sign for Morris that the president must come to try to give him a push in the surveys," said Simon Hedar, a colleague from the West Virginia University, reports Reuters.
The U.S. cup of Ryder in 2018: The team is moving forward to the fight to keep hopes for a Sunday.
After the three one-sided sessions of the four Saturday Day, maybe it was just what it needed for this Rider Cube.
The pulse that's floating is a completely invented sports concept in which the players sincerely believe, and nothing more than competitive competition.
So where would they say the impulse now?
"They had the advantage of six points, and now four, so I think we're going through it with a little impulse," said Jordan sleeping, walking over the day.
Europe's advantage is, of course, at four points forward and in the game another twelve.
The Americans, as Spith says, feel that they have a light wind, and they have anything to hope not at all, because of the forms of Spith and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each can praise three points of four.
Spith was a mortal from the shirts to the green and is an example.
These throat screams of celebration were getting louder as long as his round duned, and he stabbed a decisive strike to play in a match in four fields when they and Thomas had declined two to two.
His strike, which let them win in the 15th match, was met with a similar cry, kind of the one that tells you that he believes that the American team is not excluded.
"We just need to deepen and worry about your own match," said Spita.
Every one of these players has gone.
18 holes to make a score.
In the last two days, the only players who got more points than Spith and Thomas are Francesco Malinara and Tommy Fleetwood, the rumorless story of the Ryder Cube.
It's strange but charming couples in Europe four of four and they can't do anything wrong.
"Maliwood" were the only pair that did not make a godgi on Saturday, the afternoon, but they also escaped the godgies on Saturday morning, Friday and Friday afternoon Friday.
This happens, and as their energy seems to flow to this violent crowd and from it, and it confirms that they are players who win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to close the potential victory in Europe when the sun comes in Le Golf National than Flitwood or Malinara.
You want them both in different holes at the same time.
The talk about European glory remains pre-range.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short work on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's furchet, when he was pair with Alex Norren.
Godgy and two twins on the front nine took out the Spanish and swed him, which they were never able to get out of.
In Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
Four ball matches and fours are so interesting to watch closely because of the interaction between couples, the paradise they give, the parade they don't perform, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe has become a better team before and has taken a significant role on the last day, but this fourth meeting also indicates that the US team is trying to fight, which some have doubted, especially in the States.
Europe comes to the final Cube Ryder with number 10-6
Europe will get a good advantage on the last day of the Rider Cube after the Saturday matches of four balls and four over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Malinari launched two victories over Tiger Woods to summarize the results in Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, trying to save the trophies they lost in Hazeltin two years ago, ruled in the American dissatisfaction agency in the morning, getting a series of 3-1.
The United States offered greater resistance in the match four balls, winning two matches, but they couldn't do more.
To save the trophy, Jim Furrick's side requires eight points from 12 single matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European starter who won four points in a row, and he and Malinari, who got the name Mollywood after the sensible weekends, is only the second pair that won four points for his first four matches in the history of the Rider Cube.
By breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they were greatly stuck to win the deployed Woods and the American colleague of Bryson Decomb still 5 and 4.
Woods, who spent himself in two matches on Saturday, showed a random flash of shiny, but now he lost 19 of 29 times in the matches of four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rowes, resting at the x matches of four balls, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in four ball matches before losing 2 & 1 Dustina Johnson and Brooks Copkey, is taking the same place in the world.
Europe had no way, though it was a pleasant, fresh day south of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, the three-fold Jordan Spith winner and Justin Thomas set the control point for the Americans two points.
They earned 2 and 1 on John Ram and John Dalter from Spain in matches of four balls and returned later to conquer Puller and Rory Macilroy 4 and 3 in fours, losing two holes.
Only twice in history, the Rider Cube team came back from a deficit of four points that goes alone, although the owners of Furiq only need to be drawn to keep the trophy.
But after the next two days, which were the best, the contratact on Sunday looks like they're gonna make it.
North Korea says "no way" won't be armed in one side without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated that on Saturday, the United Nations organization continues to sanctions that strengthen the lack of confidence in the United States, and in such conditions the country cannot give up nuclear weapons in a unilateral manner.
Rie Yoon Ho stated at the annual General Assembly of the world that last year, North Korea has taken “significant measures of goodwill”, such as the cessation of trials at nuclear and missile stations, the demonstration of the nuclear testing zone and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the answer by the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there will be no way first to disarma yourself."
Despite the fact that Ri was re-published by the usual North Korean complaints against Washington's opposition to the "Potapple" approach to the dinucleorisation, in which North Korea was rewarded, since she had taken progressive steps, his statement turned out to be significant that he did not deny a unilateral deuclearisation notice that was done by Pyñan in the past.
Ri rescued a joint statement by Kim Yen and Donald Tramp at the first in history of the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim was working on the road to the “denuclearization of the Korean Similar Island”, while Tramp promised to provide security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea is trying to officially end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States stated that Phenyan should give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resisted an appeal to abolish the cruel international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States of America first insists on "denuclearing" and increasing pressure levels by sanctions to achieve their goal in a forced way, and even speak against "the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an incredib dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans on the second summit between Kim and Tramp, which the U.S. chief noted earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kima and South Korea Leader Moon Jean in the past five months and added: "If the participant in this issue of denucleoisation was South Korea, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Pool would not be such a dumb one."
Nevertheless, the tone of the Ri speech was sharply different from the last year when he spoke at the United Nations General Assembly argued that the targeting to the United States Continent with North Korea's missile was unavoidable after Mr. Zlo's President Tramp called Kim a "racketman" suicide.
This year, in the United Nations Tramp, who threatened the "integrity to destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that there would be much more to do, and sanctions must remain in force until that pair until North Korea is denuclearised.
On Wednesday, Tramp reported that he had no time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three or five months, it doesn't matter."
The Security Council said it was worth rewarding Phenyan for the measures taken.
However, the Secretary of the United States. Mike Pampea told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that "The execution of the Security Council sanctions must continue actively and necessarily until we are sure of the full, final and valid dinucleorism."
The Security Council strengthened sanctions against North Korea in 2006, trying to stop financing the Phenyan nuclear and balistic missile programs.
Pompea met with Ri in the Safety Council Halls, and the General Assembly then said that next month he would visit Phenyan again to prepare for the next summit.
Pompea visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Phenyan, saying that progress made with North Korea for a few hours of talks, ended up with a visa statement that he performed the requirements "like gangsters".
At a meeting with Moon this month, the North Korea has gone through to eliminate the missile installation and the nuclear complex when the United States will take "suitable measures".
Tramp said that by Kim's words "suitable measures" he was expecting is a security guarantee and aim to normalize relations with Washington, which Tramp promised in Singapore.
Harvard's students are doing their course for their right rest.
The new course of the Harvard University this year should teach students more to sleep, and it has a purpose to fight culture to learn coffee at night in his hand.
The scientist concluded that students at one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to look after themselves and their health.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of the sleep of the Harvard Medical School and a hospital specialist named Brigam and a woman's hospital, developed a course that he thought was the first of his own in the United States.
Inspired of the influence of the lack of sleep on the teaching, he began the course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, "Why did they tell me this just now, at the last school?"
"She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep -- it surprised me," he said, "The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course given by the students explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports achievement and improve the general mood.
Paul Barrayra, a psychiatrist at the Harvard Medical School and the Executive Director of Health Services at the University, said that the university decided to make a course after discovering that the students were often free of sleep for a week.
The hour-long course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's a picture of a room in the internet where students press on cups of coffee, curtains and books that tell about the influence of cafeteria and light and how lack of sleep affects sports indicators, and the importance of habits before sleep.
In the next stage, participants tell how long-term deprivation of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive images, encourages participants to think about their everyday life.
"We know that this will not instantly change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they must know it as they all know about the effects of smoking for health," said Professor Chasler.
He said that the culture of night nights still exists, adding that modern technologies and constantly growing pressure on students leads to a deprivation of sleep, which is a growing problem.
"The sufficient sleep of good quality must be a "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety," he said, "and even to avoid excessive weight, as the deprivation of sleep makes the brain constantly hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped professor Chassler to develop a course.
He said that course opened his eyes and inspired to teach everyone at the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask us to finish the same learning program before you get to the university.
Professor Chassler recommended that students can set a clock to know if to go to sleep and when they wake up, realizing the harmful effects of the blue light, which are radiated from screens of screens and light light lights that can change the daily mode, which leads to a problem with sleeping.
Livingstan 1:0 Rangers: Menga is killing Gerard's goal.
The Rangers had another defeat when the goal of Dolly Mangy assured that Stephen Gerard would not be defeated at 1,0 at the Levingston stadium.
Ibrax wants to write his first victory on the triumph with the number 4-1 in February, but Gary Holton's team has already lost Gerard as a manager from 18 games to leave on his side eight points, standing away from the Leaders of the Ladbrokes Hearts.
Mengo hit seven minutes before a break, and the Rangers team, inspired by naked, didn't seem to suffer defeat.
At the same time, as the Rangers is falling to the sixth place, Levingstan rose to the third place, and the Hiberniani are behind with a difference in the balls.
For the Rangers, there may be additional problems after the Forward Colum Spence should be treated with a head trauma after he got a subject, thrown out of the tribune.
Gerard made eight changes in players, so Ira didn't play half-final Batford Cube.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Liva under the 11th room that allowed to pick up the item from Hearts last week, and was delighted at how well they walked around their opponents every step.
The Rangers were more possessed by the ball, but Livigstan made more attempts to kill the ball.
They were supposed to be killed in two minutes when the first time Mengi sent the ball through Scott Pittman to the gate of Alan McGregor, and then the semi-protector used this chance.
Successful punishment of Jacobs Caygan singed the Craig Hulkett suddenly, but his partner for the protection of Alan Litgs was able to hit the back.
The Rangers took control, but the last third of the games were more likely to kill than a good game.
Alphredo Marellas was certainly to be punished by a fine for a quarter of an hour before the end, when he and Stephen Loules encountered in the field, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not accept the complaint of Colombia.
"Rangers" managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but the former Ibrox Liam Kali had almost given the goal to Lassan Coolibali and the effective attack of this Echaria.
While killing the first goal in the 34th minute, Livi might have been opposed to the next active game, but no one denies that they must demonstrate a good game.
And again, the Rangers couldn't break Jacobs' gate.
Scott Arfield didn't answer when Declan Gallagher gave a pass to Scott Robinson who blocked Menga to get the opportunity to kill at the gate.
Gerard replaced the Culibals' break with Ryan Kent, and it turned out to be an effective effect when attacking strike to Morrelas, but the impressive Cali raided and blocked the blow.
But Levingston continued to satisfy the visitors, playing that game, which it was them who liked, while Lithuans and Halket continued to share the ball after a long opposition.
The side of Holt was able to prevail only for the last few minutes, but McGregor played well to resist Jacobs before Lithuanias went to the reservation club.
The replacement of Rangers Glennham Midlton happened again once after the punishment of a fine, when he met Jacobs, but Tomson managed to avoid.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger Counter.
A page from our almanache "the Sunday morning": on September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PAPLICY... the day of the future physics John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of determining and measuring radioactiveness, which resulted in a device known as Geiger's number.
Geiger's numberer became part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film called Koranad, which seemed to be the familiar scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers, "This is Geiger's number, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your earrings, you really have the possibility to hear the sounds of atoms that are given by radiation in minerals."
Evans: "Say, is that really smashing now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before the 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to use.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system "see" cancer cells.
A new anti-anti-carbon vaccine can help the immune system "see" the bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine is how to teach the immune system to recognise the bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method provides for getting immune cells from the patient and changing them into the lab.
Then cells can see a protein spread in many cancer cells and then reinsert the help cells.
The test vaccine shows successful results for patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who was introduced in a vaccine that helped the immune system to identify the cancer cells saw that the cancer of the liquor disappeared for 18 months.
The method includes getting immune cells in the patient, changing them in the lab so that they can "see" HER2 protein, common for many cancer cells, and then reinstated.
This is what Professor Jay Berzoffski of the U.S. National Institute of River in Bethes of Maryland said, and our results show that there is a very perspective vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-care cells fighting the race of milk iron, creamers, light and fat pockets," said Professor Berozofski.
Similar approach to the detection of immune cells in patients and the "science" to achieve their cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leucose.
Canye West started a discussion in support of Tramp, wearing the Maga title, after it appeared at the CNN.
That didn't turn out good.
In the studio during the Saturday Saturday evening, the Canye West was convicted after the talk where he waved the United States. President Donald Tramp said that he would speak for the second time in 2020.
After performing his third song at the evening called the City of Privid, when he was in the hat "Let's make America a big again," he spoke against the democrats and confirmed his support for Tramp.
"How many times am I talking to the white, and they said, "How can you support Tramp, he's racist?"
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL started the show with the main role of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood Star was praying for the testimony of Breta Cavanaugh in front of the senate court office during the consideration of the sexual violence of Christine Blacey Ford.
Despite the fact that the speech was not transmitted, the words of West fell into a frame and were loaded into social media by Chris Year.
I don't understand if Rock tried to deal with West.
Furthermore, West complained to the audience that he had a difficult time behind the clubs.
They thanked me for the bullets.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat.
They thanked me.
"And then they say I'm in a fatal place," he said, as the newspaper the Washington Examiner reported.
West continued: Do you want to see the fatal place? "Saying that he's wearing my Squareman's hat, which meant that he couldn't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try to love.
Because of his statements, at least twice the hearings were removed, and the SNS representatives were confused by Veroita's message. "The entire studio shut up."
West was taken as a replacement of Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, Reper McMiller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many of the execution of the song I love it, dressed in a bottle of water Perrier.
West received support from the TPSA Conservative Party manager, Kendes Turner, who wrote on the Twitter, "Some of the bravest spirit thank you for your support."
But the leading show Karen Hunter wrote that West was just who he is, and it's always great.
"But I've decided not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes, or by supporting the "art" that I think, covers and distorts the ideology that hurts my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
In front of the show, the reper announced on Twitter that changed his name, saying that he's now "the official name of Cainey West."
He wasn't the first artist who changed his name, and went after the Deaddie's tracks, also known as Puff Didi.
His colleague reper Snoop Dogg called the collapse of Snoop Lion and of course a legend of music, who changed his name as a symbol, and then still he and an artist known earlier as Prince.

The Sound throne star of Keith Harrington captured the idealized brutality.
Kit Harrington is familiar with his sword and role John Snow in the "Game Snow" series in the Mediterranean Syrial HBO
But 31-year-old actor got a stereotype of the maco hero, which means that young boys often feel harder to respect.
Speaking at the Sunday Times Cultural Division, Keith said that he thought something happened and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the year #MeToo.
The whale, who recently married his neighbour on the Sound Throne, Rows Leslie, who was also 31, admitted that he was in power to solve this problem.
"Do I feel personally a strong guy - if we were wrong with courage?" he said.
"Why do we teach men when they grow up from the point of view that we see now?"
The whale believes that television must be responsible for being brutal because of very men's personality.
And he said, "What's lying at the beginning and why are they teaching it?
Why are they teaching on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they must be so sure to be a real man?
I think this is really one of the biggest questions in our day -- how do we change it?
Because obviously something happens to young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that next summer the series will be over, and he will come out of the battle field of the series and will not do docveles or sikwells to the "Game thrones".
Since November, the Whale will rebuild the true West Sam Shepherd, who is a historic director with his brother, who is a slave.
Recently, the actor told me that he considered a meeting with his wife Rows the best reminder to finish the throne game.
"I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life here," he said.
The rose played Igrit (Ygritte), a person who was in love with a hero of Keith John Snow in this fantasy series rewarded by Amy.
A couple promised in June 2018 at Leslie's headquarters in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
According to healthcare workers, more than 820 000 people have been infected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
Most of the new cases were passed through sex, as it was in the past.
The traditional HIV infection is spread in some areas of China as a result of transfusions of blood.
"But the number of people who have been infected by HIV through transfusions of blood has decreased almost to zero," said Chinese officials at the Yunnan Conference.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000 people.
Sex-infecting HIV is a sharp problem of the Chinese LGBT group.
Homosexualism has been decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still.
Because of conservative preciousness in the country, about 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men, they eventually marry women.
Many diseases are spreading from insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the government of China has gone through universal access to HIV medicinal products in its efforts to solve this global problem.
Maxine Watters denies the inflammation of data, danger and theory of conspiracy by her parliament staff
The U.S. Congresswoman, Maxine Watters, was accused on Saturday that her employee had given personal information about three Republican Senators on the Wikipedia pages.
Democratic Los Angeles argued that there were claims to the participants on the right wing and their sites.
"False, lie, and a lot of disgusting lies," says the statement of Waters in Twitter.
The information published is reported to include home addresses and phone numbers in the United States. Sense: Lindsey Graham from South Caroline and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of Utah.
Information placed by an unknown man on the Capitalian Hill during the hearing of the Senate Commission on Sexual Distress against a member of the Supreme Court, Breta Cavano, appeared on the Internet on Thursday.
The escape took place a while after the three senators questioned Cavano.
"Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, report that the IP address of the sources was linked to the Waters office and provided information from the Watters team," said Hill.
"This unreasonable claim is completely false and absolutely false," Wothers continued.
"Article of my team, whose data, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraud and false accusations, he has never been responsible for the escape of this information.
This unreasonable claim is completely false and absolutely false."
The Statement of Waters quickly criticized the Internet, including the former press secretary of the White House of Ary Flaysher.
"This denies anger," wrote Flaisher.
This means that she has no courage to be a member of Congress.
If anyone's accused of what they didn't do, they shouldn't be mad.
They shouldn't behave themselves disgusting.
They should not put in doubt the motives of their accusations.
They must be calm and generous.
Flaysher compared Waters' response to the criticism of democrats to Judge Cavano when they were accused of being too angry during hearing on Thursday.
Amar Navara, a candidate from the Republican Party, who was talking and participating in interim election meetings, also said on Twitter.
"It's a resannance when it turns out to be true," he wrote.
In her statement, Watters said that her office warned the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false statements.
"We guarantee that the guilty will be found," she continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are distructive and dangerous to any of my team's employees."
Johnny English Strikes Again's explosives on the invented spy of Rowen Atkinsan.
Now it's become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new British film, and this slope seems to be in the comedy and an Exchn-French Johnny Ingles, which started in 2003 with Johnny Inglish and extended in 2011 entitled "Johnnie Englez Reunion".
Can the satyr be well expressed about how obviously ill we look when we talk about the new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, incompetent Johnny English got the opportunity to laugh over things--his name was more loud than all the comic creatures that he did for not English watchers in the movies.
Of course, he's a secret agent, who, despite his fabulous claims to glamour, got a little similar to Clouseau with Mr. Bino's rises and a bit of such a guy who brought a single note to the Hor of fire at the ceremony of the opening of the Allied in London in 2012.
Originally his personnel was based on the traveller and international mysteries of Atkinson, who once played in forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
There are a few nice moments that weren't before.
I loved Johnny Inglish, who approached the helicopter, dressed in the mid-term supplies, and the slopes of the rotor a little knocking on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for the theater comedy is brightly demonstrated, but humor feels weak, and that's why it's especially strange when serious movies such as "Agent 007: non-scientific mission" offer comedy as a major part.
Humor feels like it's not only for adults but also for children, and even the silly unfortunate unfortunate accidents of Johnny English is not as inventory as quietly as Atkinson movies in the Bean.
The many-year-old industries are the serious problems of Britain.
Cyber hacker broke into the super secret British spy community in Britain, opening the names of all British agents on the ground, unfortunately the small role of Kevin Eldon, before disappointing his employee.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a proud and mixed actor who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for this Tereza May Quaze, but there's nothing in the script.
Her intelligence advisors report that since each real spy will be discovered, she will have to engage one of those who are already retired.
And this means that for Johnny Inglish himself everything is complicated, he's now working as a sixth teacher in several special institutions, and he's giving lessons about being an uncovered operator: some good examples here, because Inglish offers the Academy of Music Lessons of Spying.
And Inglish returned to Whitehall for an extra briefing and joined his ex-year-old friend Bo, who was playing again Ben Miller.
At present, for my marriage is bound to the commander of the submarine boat, whose role Vicki Pepperdin performed a little in vain.
So Batman and Robin get horrible wrong things in the Queen's secret agency where they work again meeting a beautiful woman of the Wool Piece.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister receives a dangerous command of a charismaic technical billionaire who claims that he can solve the problem with British hackers: the vicious Jason Volt, who is playing with Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Bow start their escape from immediate things: masking under the officer, burning the French restaurant; creating a rush, fighting the trampers on the boat of the luxury yacht; and Inglish makes a clean anarchy, because he's trying to use a visual reality suite to get to know the inside of the Wallth's house.
All the moments are pulled out for the last event, but they're as pleasant and noisy, which have quite a lot of childhood in the TV.
Pretty good stuff.
And how about other movies about Johnny Inglish I couldn't think, can't the British movie industry give Rowan Atkinsan a role that really represents his talent?
The Leiborist Party denies that a plan is designed to pay the British for a four-day working week, paying for five days.
Jeremy Corbina's working party has to consider a radical plan when the British work only four days a week, but they're paid for five.
It is reported that the party wants business managers to deliver work results made as a result of artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra weekend.
It was apparent that employees would enjoy the three-day weekends, but they would still get the same earnings.
The source notes that the idea is consistent with the economic program of the Party and is going to direct the country to support workers.
The trade unions' meeting accepted the transition for a four-day week as a good way to use a change in the economy.
The oldest source in the Lebarian Party told for the Sunday Times: "The planned review of action will be announced by the end of the year.
This is not going to happen now, but the four-day working week is the idea that fits the view in the party and the overall industrial strategy to regulate the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Leiborist Party is not the first one who approves this idea, the Green Party promises to hold a four-day working week during a general election company in 2017.
However, the efforts of the Leiborist Party are not generally supported.
The representative of the Leiborist Party said, "The four-day working week is not a political goal, and it's not considered a party.
Chancellor John McDonalle used a working conference last week to express his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonalle said he decided to re-establish the government from "free directors" and "managers" into communities.
The plans of a shady cancer also assume that the current water resources shareholder can't get back the whole package of stocks, because the government of the Laibarists can do "post" on the basis of alleged violations.
He also confirmed that it was planned to bring workers into the company's councils and create a united property fund to transfer 10 per cent of their own funds to private employees who would hold annual dividends to 500 pounds of sterlings.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told for 60 minutes, that the FBI investigator who works with Cavano has to change his opinion.
The FBI's inquiry against the judge of Breta Cavano was put to the final vote on his election to the Supreme Court at least a week, and the question is whether the office of the Republican Senators would be able to provide support.
In the interview on Sunday, a correspondent of "60 minutes" Scott Paley asked the Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about Sense: can the FBI discover anything that could lead to changes.
Canadi turned out to be more open than his colleague from South Caroline.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
'I said, coming to the court meeting: I spoke to judge Cavano.'
And I called him after that, and I asked him why the accusation was charged by asking, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive and unanimous."
Graham's voting, however, seemed final.
"I think Brett Cavano decided that it would be a scandalous accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this, Brett denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
"And all whom she calls were unable to believe.
She's only 36 years old.
I can't see anything new."
What is the International Festival of Citizens, and what is it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is the International Festival, an annual musical event, which has a very impressive composition of speakers and performers and has a mission to stop poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Festival of Civility will take place at a large barn of Central Park, where tens of thousands will come to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, and learn about the real purpose of the event -- the cease of poverty and the nursery by 2030.
The International Civil Festival, which appeared in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Project against the Headquarters of the International Propaganda Group, which hopes to stop poverty by increasing numbers of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for activities (if you don't want to pay VIP tickets) the visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "to perform an action", to be a volunteer, to write an e-mail to the leader of the country, to call any other actors and to raise knowledge of the purpose of the ceasefire.
But how successful was the Civil Festival for 12 years and was he able to achieve his goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a worthless concert a real way to convince people that they need active action, or is it just a different case of so-calcvism -- people feel like they're doing a good job by signing online petition or by sending tweets?
Since 2011, Festival organizers have stated that more than 19 million "actions" have been fixed from their followers to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have helped incentive the influenced leaders to carry out their obligations on an account of more than $37 billion, which could affect more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group brought 390 comments on obligations and claimed at least 10 billion dollars that have already been allocated or collected.
A group estimated that the funds still have been directly affected by almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key obligations include food delivery, partnership with investors and executors based in Britain, "help for children to develop in full volume," the promise to ensure Rwanda 35 million dollars to help avoid malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 Twitters from citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of various countries, we can eradicate social injustice in history," said Ambassador Tracy Ulman in London in April 2018.
Furthermore, the group reported that after more than 5000 shares were carried out, the government announced the financing of the “food aid” project, which reaches five million women and children with food problems.
Answering one of the common questions on the website, "What makes you think we can end poverty?"
The global festival answered, "It will be a long and difficult way; sometimes we will suffer defeat and failure."
But, like the great civil rights and movements against apartheid, we're going to be successful, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Janel Monoe, are one of the series of personnel speaking this year in New York, which will lead Debra Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use MS to prevent Russian oil and gas exports
"Waszyngton may, if necessary, contact the Navy to prevent the exit of Russian energy in the EZ and the Middle East," said US Secretary Ryan Zink, Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, especially where it works on the invitation of the legal government, are a reason for studying new energy markets.
"I believe that the cause of their stay in the Middle East is that they want to acquire energy just as in Eastern Europe and south of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States are able to ensure the openness of the seaways by using the military fleet, and when necessary, to organise the block, so that their energy must not have reached the market," he said.
Zinke called on the participants of the event organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group, who is positioned as the “Voice of Energy Consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to the relationship with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same.
"The economic alternative for Iran and Russia equals more or less and replaces fuel," he said, named Russia "one-sided country" with a economy depending on digging fuels.
These statements appeared at the time when the Tramp Administration wishes to increase much the export of its stiff natural gas to Europe, replaceing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this, the workers of the Administration of Tramp, including the US President Donald Tramp, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the "wrong" project of the North Stream 2 gasway, which, according to Tramp, converted Berlin into "Flash" Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that the North Flood 2 gasway cost 11 billion dollars, which is created to double the power of existing gasway to 110 billion cubic metres, is an exclusive economic project.
Kreml claims that Washington's harsh opposition is starting in the economy and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we have the only view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting the US Energy Minister Rik Perry in September in Moscow.
The Americans were hit in response to Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
The chief German organization representing industry, the German Industrial Federation (BDI) urged the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state is interfering with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after the recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss very seriously her participation in the presidential elections of 2020, said Senator from the state Massachusetts
The Senator from the state Massachusett Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that it would be serious to consider its participation in the president's elections after the interim elections.
During the talk in Mayor Halioki, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her participation.
"There's time for women to go to Washington and order our wrong government, and I'm also talking about women in the highest positions," she said, "The Hill."
"After November 6, I'll take very serious consideration of the possibility of speaking to the president."
During the talk in Mayor Warren, she struck at President Donald Tramp, saying that "the country leads in the wrong direction."
"I am extremely concerned what Tramp does with our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Tramp and his candidate to the Supreme Court of Breta Cavano.
On Friday in her Twitter, Warren wrote "of course before the vote, the FBI should investigate."
However, the results of the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters don't think she should speak to the presidents in 2020.
According to the Centre for Political Studies of the University of Safallco/Bostan Globe, eight percent of the "potential" voters of Massachusetts said that the senator should not talk.
Twenty-two percent support her decision.
The survey showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick, where 38 percent were for and 48 percent against.
Other famous names among democrats that were discussed in relation to the potential chat in 2020 include the former Vice-President Joe Byden and the Senator of the State Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press Bayden, he's officially taking a decision until January.
When Donald Trampo's backup, Sarah Paulin mentioned the post-traumatic syndrome of Trec Polin
26-year-old Track Paulin spent a year in Iraq after his call for a September service.
Monday night he was arrested and he was charged with domestic violence
"What my son is going through after return, I can compare with the results of the post-traumatic syndrome and injuries that our soldiers are returning, in other families," she said to be gathered on an occasion in support of Donald Tramp in Tulsa, Achlahoma.
Pauline called this arrest a "free question" and said that her son along with other veterans of war "is returning a little bit different, argued, returning with question whether there is respect for which soldiers, pilots, other wars, giving themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wassila, Alaska and he was accused of domestic violence against a woman, an obstacle to the attempt to report domestic violence, finding weapons in a drunk state, according to Dan Bennett's information, the press secretary of the police department, Wassilla.
18 states and district of Colombia support the condemnation of a new policy on the delivery of the harbor
Eighteen states and the Colombian district support the condemnation of the new U.S. policy that denies the victims of gang or domestic violence in the harbor.
The representatives of 18 states and county of Colombia filed analytical note on Friday in Washington to support the condemnation of the harbor policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the case of Grace against Seshns, which was opened in August by the American Union on Civil Rights against Federal Politics, was not discovered.
She stated that her partner "and his friends from a hard gang" raped her, but the US authorities of 20 July refused at the harbor.
She was detained in Texas.
Grace's supporting lawyers described El Salvador, Gonduras and Guatemala, who are making the most requests for a port in the U.S., like countries with serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American policy on the harbor changed the decision of 2014 of the Appeal Commission on Immigration, which allowed immigrants without documents who are victims of domestic violence to be sent to the port.
Colombian Attorney General Carl Racin said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of legal experience of states, countries and peace."
"Federal law requires that applications at the port be based on specific facts and circumstances of the case, and this change breaks this principle," says the analytical note.
The lawyers also said in the note that politics that denies immigrants would worsen the US economy, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and "create necessary jobs".
The Prosecutor General Jeff Seshns ordered in June the immigration judges to no longer harvest victims of domestic violence and violence by gangs.
"It is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or belonging to a social group or political views," said Seshns on 11 June, announceing this policy.
The accommodation never meant a solution to the problems, even all the serious problems people faced every day around the world.
The desperate saving work in Palo. During trying to find survivors, the number of lives has doubled.
The survivors are in a very difficult situation.
"It's all very tense," says 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusom, calming his little son with temperature in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Paul.
"Each minute a quick car brings bodies."
Clean water very little."
The inhabitants began to return to their ruined houses, retrieving the weaknesses, trying to save everything you can find.
Hundreds of people were wounded and hospitals damaged by the earthquake by 7.5 points were filled.
Some of the wounded, including the two Harris, who broke the spine and the shoulder, are outside the army hospital of Palo, where patients are treated on the street because of strong turkeys that are repeated.
In his eyes the tears appeared when he seemed to feel strong underground strikes in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to resist.
I was stuck under the ruins of the walls," said Harris Associated Press, and added that his family arrived in the city to marry.
"I heard the wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accuses China of "threats" using the "propaganda advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper printed a four-sided advertisement in the American daily, praising the mutual benefits of American and Chinese trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of the use of the US press to spread the propaganda.
The US President Donald Tramp mentioned last Wednesday a payment supplement in China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most selling newspaper of the state of Ayowa, after he accused China of attempting to engage in the US Congress on November 6th.
Tramp's accusation that China tried to interfere with the American elections indicated what American officials in the conversation with Reuters had called the new phase in Washington's company under pressure in China.
Although advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice for trade, now Beijing and Washington have solved a trade war, which resulted in mutual carriage imports.
The repressive tariffs, stated by American and Chinese experts, have been introduced to harm such an exporter as businesses from the state of Ayowa who support the Republican Party of Tramp.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States in China, and former Governor of Iowa, chief agricultural exporter in China, stated that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, wrote Branstad in a copy article of the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "now doubles its efforts, printing a propaganda advertising in our free press."
"Purposeing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, printing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," wrote Bransted.
"And if you look at the paper kits in Beijing, there you will find not so many votes against and you will not see the real reflection of other opinions that the Chinese may have about the dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking into account the fact that the press is under the iron-fifth communist party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers gave up the proposal" to print his article, even though he didn't even call that newspaper.
The Republicans are pushing women-electorals on the front of the interim elections from the Cavano Fiasco, warning analysts
While many well-known Republicans defend the candidate's position to the Supreme Judge, Breta Cavano, to face several sexual violence, the analysts warned that they would get a hit in response, especially from women, during future interim elections.
The emotions around this were very strong, and most republicans already indicate that they are ready to vote.
"These things can't be returned," said Grant Rihar, a professor of politics in the school of Maxwell of the Syracuse University of The Hill for the article.
Rihar said that he was not sure that the statements of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) on the investigation by the FBI would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow and November," said Corrine Jean-Pierre on Friday, the chief advisor and national press secretary of the MoveOn Progress Group from Washington, Colombia.
On Friday morning, the protesting protested "Least Quick!" during the demonstration in the Senate Hall, when the Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to make the Cavano candidature despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blacey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democrats will be extremely great," stated Stu Rotenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they're tall and that's true.
But they can be even higher, especially among women who are elected in cities and young voters between 18 and 29 years of age, who don't even like the president but often don't vote."
Even in the open statement of Ford, in which she detailed her charges to the Supreme Court of Sexual Violence, analysts suggest that if the Republicans insist on confirmations, there may be a strong hit in response.
"For the Republican Party it has become some mixture," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Bureau of the Republican Party at the beginning of the past week, according to NBC News.
"The talk is not about the voting of the Bureau or the final vote, or whether Cavano will be in position. Talk about how the Republicans dealt with it and how they made it," I noticed the news channel Guy Cecil, director Priorities of the United States, a group that helps choosing democrats.
But it looks like the Americans were divided in the matter of Ford or Cavano, and it's a little more speaking for the last one.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of the residents are probably or are not very trusted by Ford's statements, and 35 percent say they're probably not really trusting Cavano.
Furthermore, 38 percent said that they believe that Cavano was possible or probably lying in his statement, and 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's trigger, the FBI is investigating Ford's charges and at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under oath in front of the Legal Bureau of the Senate, that Cavano, when he was drunk, was screwing her at 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that the candidate at the Supreme Court showed her its genitalia at the party when they were studying in Ayla in the 1980s.
The world network inventor plans to start New Internet to compose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world's network, launchs a startup that will be made by Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built on the open platform of Berners Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where the data is stored and who has permission to access this information.
In an exclusive interview of the Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that, creating the intrusion, he meant "wing over the world."
"We must do it now," he said about startup.
"This is a historic moment."
Solid uses solid technology to allow people to create their own data storage on the Internet or the Pod.
This can contain contact lists, jobs, calendars, fanaches and other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available all at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal repository on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal reinforcement of the potential using data."
According to John Bruce's executive director, the idea of creating the Inrupt makes the company possible to build up resources, process and the necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is now composed of Berners Lee, Bruce, security platforms bought by IBM, several developers working on the contract and volunteers coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized programs using tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Brners Lee said that he and his team weren't talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to make changes or not fully when all their business models are being reviewed immediately.
"We do not ask for their permission."
The Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid."
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet by creating the Consortion of the World Network at the Massachusett Technology Institute.
In recent months, Berners Lee has been very influenced by the neutrality of the web.
Even starting the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortion, the Web Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the new era of the web," Berners Lee added.
Bernard Van: Reverend of the Priest Rewarded by the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only priest of the English Church, awarded by Victoria's cross during the First World War as a participant of the war, was marked in his city 100 years later.
Reverend Bernard Van was awarded on September 29, 1918 for the involvement of Belangliz and Leakur.
But four days later, he died from a sniper bullet and never found out that he had received the highest military reward of British.
On Saturday in Rashden, County Northgamptanshire, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone at the parade.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that it was "very symbolic" that the stone was opened 100 years after his grandfather was awarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the vice-in-lawman Van took his battalion through the San Quentin channel "with a thick fog and under the strong rosy and bulletfire of the employee."
Then he ran on the line of fire and "with great courage" led the soldier forward, captured his own gun and slashed three divisions.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions were "things that I would never be able to do, and also something worthy of respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also set up a vein after a paradise, which was headed by the Imperial youth archester of Brentwood.
Michael Van said that "to him a great honour to take part in the parade," and added that "the marriage of the real hero was demonstrated by the support that many have. "
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, they instead got pep's pig
Imagine you've been standing all night to see a packed transfer from Bellator 206, and then you're denying the main event.
The program with San Hasse had 13 fights, including six on the main map, and they showed up on the direct air all night on the British Channel 5.
And at 6 a.m., when Gerard Mussassi and Rory McDonald prepared for the fight, watching in Britain just freaked out when the program changed into Pep's pig.
Some were disappointed after they spent the nightless, especially waiting for this fight.
One of the Twitter Twitter's tweeters called switching to a child's painting as a "something a stupid joke."
In response to the issue of the broadcast of Dave Schwartz, the Senior Vice-President Bellator on Marketing and Communications said, "Well, according to the state order, and 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and it had to be switched to the child program."
"Yes, Pig Pep."
President of Bellator Scott Cocker said they'd be working on the program in the future to consider British audiences.
"I think we're discussing the possibility of repeating, I think, we can solve this issue," said Cocker.
"But now is 6 a.m. on Sunday, and we can't solve it until Sunday by our time, and this is Monday in their time.
But we're doing our best.
Now, believe me, when the programs changed, we got a lot of messages, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the question, considering it a technical error.
But it turned out to be a state order.
I can tell you, next time, that's not going to happen.
We're reducing the number of substances from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to advise fans, but we've overcome.
It's a disturbing situation."
"The Disk of the Inhuman Island": Tom Daily felt "significant" because of sexuality
The alpine jumping in the water, Tom Daley, said, he was growing up with a sense of insignificance for others because of his sexuality -- but that gave him motivation in his way of success.
24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not all like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking at the Radio 4 Disk of the Unnatural Island, Lauren Lavern, he said that he supports the rights of gays to give hope to others.
He also stated that if he had a child he began to think less about the winning on the olympics.
The traditional leading this pretty old program of Kirstie Young, took a rest for a few months due to sickness.
As a man who ended up on an unpublic island, at the first program of Lavern, Daley said that when he was a child, he felt "being smaller" than everyone else, because "the public didn't take those who liked both boys and girls."
He said, "I think it's a feeling that you're not like everyone and that you're insignificant, that's what gave me strength and inspiration to success."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said not to disappoint those who learned of his sexuality.
The two-fold bronze prize of the alimpics has become a significant activist of the LGBT movement and in Australian Communities games this year called for the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to live openly without persecution and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-fold world champion said that when he fell in love with a man -- an American script, directors, and predators, Dastine Lance Blacke, who met in 2013, "that was unexpected for me."
Daley married Oscar's owner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said the difference at age doesn't matter.
"When you walk through this in such a young age," he was at the first olympics of 14 years old, and three years later his father died of the cancer -- he said it was hard to find a peasant who would have survived such flights and falls.
In June, they became parents, their son's name is Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said his "the perspectives completely" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I should win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than a golden Olympic medal.
Robbie is my golden olympic medal."
His son was also called Robert, and his father died in 2011 at his 40-year-old age from the cancer of the brain.
Daily said that the father didn't accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they bought tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 -- he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him," you won't sit in the first row, dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died I finally realized that he was not immortal," he said.
Next year, Dalee competed at the Olympics 2012 and I won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I had dreamed about it all my life -- jumping into the water in front of my ballots in the Olympic games, that's the best sense," he said.
This also affected the choice of a song -- the Proud from Heather Smoll -- who found in it a reaction in preparing for the olympics and from which ants run from.
"The Disk of the Inhuman Island" can be listened to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 by British summer time.
Michelson, who is not in shape, remains on a reservation club in Ryder's cup on Saturday
The American Phil Michelson put a record on Sunday, playing his 47 matches in the Rider's cup, but he has to turn his shape back so that this event doesn't happen unhappy.
Michaelson, who's going to play this competition that is held once for two years, recorded the 12th time, Captain of Jim Furyk planted a reservation club on Saturday Force.
Instead of being in the center of the events, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-fold winner of the cup divided his days between the work of the parent and the training, hoping to return into shape.
Even at the top of his career he was not the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfist is not an ideal choice for the uneasy field of Le Golf National, where he was cruelly condemned by unauthorized strikes.
And if the field is not enough dark enough, Michelson's ninth match on Sunday will fight the exact British Open Francesco Malinara champion, who won all four matches this week with Tommy Flitwood.
If the Americans, who stand by four points at the beginning of 12 single matches, start with success, Michaelson's match might turn out to be extremely important.
Fürique expressed confidence in this player, but he couldn't say anything else.
"He fully understood his present role, flattered me on his back, drawn up, and said that he would be ready tomorrow," said Fürique.
"He's very sure of himself.
He was taken to the glory Hall and gave a lot of commands last week.
Maybe I didn't plan it for two matches.
I was planning more, but it worked just so we thought to play.
He wishes to be in the field as well as everyone else."
Michelson will beat Nick Fald's record by number of matches in Rider's cup played Sunday.
This could be the end of the career in the Rider's cup, which was never the same achievement as in individual games.
Michelson's 18 wins, 20 loses and seven fields, even though Fürick said that his presence was a good thing for the command.
"He is a ridiculous, sarkastic, with humor, loving to harass over people and just a very good man, who is good to have in the command," he explained.
"I believe that more young players pleasedly pared his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He gives the command a lot more than a simple game."
The Captain of the European Team Thomas Bjorn knows that a big break could disappear soon.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows with experience that a significant break before the individual games the last day on the Rider's cup can easily disappear.
The Danish player debited in Walderam in 1997, where the European team led by Sevo Balesteros had the advantage of five points above the Americans, but finished with a minimum advantage of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that in Walderham we had a great advantage and victory, but hardly we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost," said Bjorn after watching how the Class of 2018 team won 5-3 and Friday and yesterday, and had a number of 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"The story shows me and everyone else in the team that this isn't the end.
Tomorrow we have to play at all a hundred.
Go out in the field and do everything right.
Until the results appeared in the table, nothing is finished.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, that's what we're focusing on.
I keep saying this, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that the opposite side is the best players in the world."
And I'm pleased with how the players played it on a hard golf field, and Bjorn added, "I'll never overestimate myself.
There's going to be a different game tomorrow.
The games will be individual tomorrow, and this will be different.
It's just great when you're on the field with a partner and it's all right, but when you're playing alone, your real talents of the golf are checked out here.
That's what you need to bring to the players that they have to show the best thing tomorrow.
Now you have to leave a partner; the hole must go and also show all the best to the individual player."
Unlike Burn, his opponent, Jim Fürick, hopes for a better individual game of their sports than the one they showed in partnership, except for Jordan Speed and Justin Thomas, who took three points from four.
Füriq himself was on both sides of these matches the last day, playing a victory team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had "The Wonder in Medina."
"I remember every word of this," he said, answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 set up his players for the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we always want to have a quick start you've seen in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the speed grows, the largest pressure turns on those playing games in the middle.
We made the right layout and put the players on the way we liked it, and you know, tomorrow we're trying to get some magic."
Thomas got the task to start playing and speak against Rory Macilroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rows, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter will play against top golfists.
"I put my players in this order, because I think I'll close everything," Bjorn said about his choice for individual matches.
A drop of a new German warship has been relocated
The new BMF fregate of Germany had to enter in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold Wartimes, but it would appear not sooner in the next year because of incompatible systems and constantly increasing costs, according to local media messages.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the absolutely new class of the Baden-Wuerttemberg fregates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, as wrote Die Zeit, quoting a military representative.
The ship was supposed to be in 2014, but the problems that occurred after construction prevented this ambitious project.
Four military ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered in 2007, should replace the old Bremen fregates.
They will be armed with strong weapons, various anti-ship missiles and axle missiles, as well as some Stels technology, such as a reduced visibility for radars, infrared and acustical signatures.
Among other important characteristics -- longer periods between service -- more new fregates may not go into their ports for up to two years.
However, continuous deficiencies mean that modern battleships -- which can allow Germany to demonstrate its powers outside the country -- are aged until they finally enter the building, Die Zeit notes.
The unhappy fregate F125 got in heads last year when the German BMF officially refused to take the ship and returned it back to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
For the first time the Navy returned the ship to the port after the delivery.
About the reasons for return, it is very little, but the German media wrote about many "programm defects and hardware" that make the ship vain in the battle mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, because Baden-Wuerttemberg ships have only 120 sailors -- half the crew of the old Bremen fregates.
It also turned out that the ship has a very big weight, which reduces its productivity and limits the possibility of further updates.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs 7,000 tonnes, which doubles the weight of ships of the same class that Germany used in World War II.
Besides the lack of equipment, the price of the whole project -- including the training of the crew -- is also a problem.
The price reached the incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) but at first it was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that accumulate with new fregates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the sea powers of Germany are declined.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartells, head of the German Protection Bureau, stated that the IMF "mays less ships capable of military missions."
He said that the problem with time is growing, because the old ships are listing, and ships are not replaced.
He complained that none of the fregates of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the IMF.
The national company on the guard of monuments listened to the secret life of speakers
A new study in the Scotland Mountain is aimed at identifying how scratches use landscapes in hunting for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of the unique flying milk-feeders and help in future actions to protect these animals.
Study of scientists of the National Company of the Scotland's monuments is dealing with small sculptures and also with the storms of Dobanton's long-shooking sculptures in the gardens of Invere in Western Ross.
Special Writing Tools will be placed in the main places of this location to watch the speeches during the season.
Company workers and volunteers will conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
The expert analysis of the sounds of all records determines the frequency of calls of speakers and what they're saying what they're doing.
The map of living and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Duar, the National Company Adviser for Nature Conservation, hopes that the results will show which areas are most important and how each species uses them.
This information will help you identify the advantages of creating a place of living like the lungs, and how to maintain forests to live with fogs and other animals associated with them.
The number of speakers in Scotland and Britain has decreased significantly over the last century.
They're threatened by building and developing work that affects and destroys them.
The wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as sticky fly feeds and some chemicals for building materials, and they are threatened by cats.
Speaked at all not blind.
But because of their nightlife, the ears speak more sensitive than the eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use a complex escalation technique to identify bugs and obstacles on their way.
The national society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very seriously treated by the speakers.
It's working for ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, residence checks, and sometimes rescue events.
The organization even created the first and only Scotland commander of speakers in the landlord of Trie in Damfris and Hollyway, where eight of the ten species of Scotland speakers live.
David Thompson's owner says it's a perfect territories for speakers.
"Here, in the Trip, we have just a great place for speakers," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about speeches, so our work here and in other households will help to understand more what they need for a better life."
He emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of scanners before carrying out the property repairs, as it can unintendedly destroy one seat by killing 400 males and young scanners, which will lead to a complete destruction of local populations.
They are under guard and are prohibited from killing, frightening, disturbing or destroying their seats.
Elizabeth Faral, the Speaker's Officer in Scotland, encourages the public to help in this matter.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our speakers, and many of the species we don't even know how their population lives."
Earlier condemns accusations of rape, while his lawyers are going to sue into the German log
Cristian Rannald called him blaming for rape "fake news," saying that people want to "represent themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to court the German journal Der Spiegel, who published these accusations.
The Forward of Portuguese and Juventus was accused of rape by Catherine Mayorga in the hotel room in Los Vegas in 2009.
Then he paid her $375,000 for silence, he wrote on Friday Der Spiegel.
In the Instagram Live 33-year-old Ranaldu, 142 million of his subscribers came in a few hours after the publication of accusations, calling this "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news," said the five-time Gold Ball owner before the camera.
"They want to make a advertisement on my name.
It's okay.
They want to become famous by mentioning my name, but it's part of my work.
I'm a happy and kind man," he added with a smile.
Ranald's lawyers are preparing a case against Der Spiegel's debate on accusations, which have been called "incorrect suspicion report in private," reports the Reuters Agency.
The lawyer, Christian Shertz, said that the player would require compensation for “moral damage in the sum that is in line with the difficulty of violation of rights, and in recent years it may be the most serious violation of personal rights.”
It's like the incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Houtel and Casinov hotel room in Los Vegas.
Meeting at Ranald and Mayorgo's night club as if they were back in football player's room, where he was raped by her analytically, as it was written in the documents of the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after that, Ranald converted and said that at "99 percent" he's a "good boy" who suffers from one percentage.
The papers claim that Ranald confessed that they had sex, but on the other hand.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of damages in the hospital, but then she agreed to the outdoor settlement, because she was very afraid of revenge, and she was concerned that it was "publicly brought."
A 34-year-old woman says she's trying to rebuild the accusation because she's having a moral injury in that case.
At the time, if this case had occurred, Ranald was going to go to the Madrid Real with the Manchester Unitid, and this summer he moved to the Italian Yuventus, closing a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain "forever saves" the loss of the car builders
Britain "forever regrets" when losing its status of the world's leader of automobile after Brexit, said the Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "restrained" the statement of the Toyota UK for BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily reduce production in the Bernastone factory, near Derby halfway.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delay on borders resulting from Brexit without an agreement could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The factory in Bernaston, where Toyota Auris and Avensis were made last year, released almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"I think when Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, the production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernastone.
Other car manufacturers in Britain raised the question of how transboundary trade will be made if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW states that he will close his Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexcit.
The main concern is what the car builders are talking about the risk of supply chains as a result of Brexit without an agreement.
The Toyota production line works on the basis of "exactly within the time" when the spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from both British and the EU for cars that are ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there may be contrasts that will lead to delay and lack of parts.
For Toyota, it will not be possible to keep more than a daily reservation of parts in Derby, said the company, so the production will stop.
Mr. Clark stated that "Plan Checkers" of Teresa May on future relations with the EU "was done exactly so to avoid these border checks."
"We need an agreement, and we want to get the best agreement that will not only allow the success of today but also allow us to use this opportunity," he said in today's BBC Radio 4.
"The information that we receive not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers suggests that we should be able to continue working successful supply chains."
The Toyota company couldn't tell how long the production would be gone, but to the future, it warned that the cost was added to reduce the competitiveness of the factory and would result in reducing jobs.
Peter Zevalarys, who works in Bernastone for 24 years and is a trade union manager, said that the members of the Union are very concerned: "In my experience, when jobs are shortened, they will no longer be renewed.
The press secretary of the government said: "We have offered a precise plan of our future relations with the EU, which deserves confidence."
The White House states that the Tramp meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again
A very important meeting of Donald Trampo with the Assistant General Prosecutor Rhode Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week", while fighting around the candidate to the Supreme Court of Breta Cavano, said on Sunday a representative of the White House.
Rosenstein is watching the work of a special advisor Robert Mueller, who is studying the involvement of Russia's elections, the Assistant Tramp and Russia, and the potential obstacle to justice by the President.
Free Tramp of the assistant of the general prosecutor or not, and thus put Mueller's independence in danger, for months pouring butter into the fire of Washington's tiles.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record talks with Tramp and the possibility of the president to be removed from his post by 25 amendments.
Rosenstein disagreed with this.
But last Monday he went to the White House among the rumors about that he was going to fall retired.
Instead, it was announced that Thursday would be a meeting with Tramp, which was at the time at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said he wouldn't "will" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflicts at the hearing at the law office of the senate, where Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blacey Ford.
On Friday, Tramp ordered to conduct a weekly FBI investigation of a statement against Cavano, which slowed the vote in the Senate.
The press secretary Tramp Sarah Sanders came up in the Sunday Fox News.
When she was asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "So far as it's not assigned, maybe this week, maybe next, and I think a week later, taking into account all the other things that have happened in the Supreme Court.
But everything will happen, and I always give press the most new information."
Some journalists are willing to condemn her claim: Sanders hasn't been carrying briffins for press in the White House since September 10th.
The leading program Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the rare Briefings are not caused by despising televizors who work for the public, although she added, "I agree with the fact that they work in the public."
Then she said that the tramp's direct contact and press would increase.
"The president meets more with press answers than any president before him," she said, adding no specific facts, "We have studied these numbers."
Briefings are happening, Sanders reported, but "if the press has a chance to ask the questions directly to the President of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We're trying to do this often, you've seen us do this in the last few weeks, and the meetings you can ask the president's question are being replaced by the briefings."
Tramp regularly answers questions whether he leaves the White House or takes part in meetings on the streets, or at press conferences with high foreign guests.
The president's press conference is rarely happening.
This week in New York, the president showed why, if he was freely and sometimes extravagant in front of the reporters.
Health Minister wrote to workers from EU countries in Scotland's health system against Brexit
The Minister for Health wrote to EU workers who work in the Scotland health system to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and wish them to remain after Brexit.
Jan Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scotland government is already ready to cover the cost of residence claims from EU citizens who work in state services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "The summer talks between Britain and the EU on the exit of our country, which leads to the expected solutions this fall.
But the British government also accelerated preparation for a script without an agreement.
I know that for all of you it's a very troubled time.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries and not only give valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care services, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us."
Cristion Abercrombi passed an emergency operation after a head trauma
Lienbacker Team Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombi carried an emergency operation after he got a head trauma in the Sunday match that his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reports Mike Authority from Tennessean.
The chief trainer Tennessee State Rod Reed told the reporter that the trauma of the player had received shortly before the break.
"He moved to the sideline and suddenly fell," said Reed.
Coaches and medicinalists gave Abercombi acid still in the field before putting it on violence and moving to diagnosis.
The Tennessee State's envoy told Chris Harris from WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercromby was operated in the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
He added that there was no "detail about what a trauma," while Tennessee State is trying to find out when the player got a trauma.
Abercombi, a sportsman secondary, spends the first season for Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full captures, which gives only 18 seasons.
Foreign buyers of British Silence will pay a larger job
According to the new conservatory plan foreign buyers of British immunity will pay a higher mail and additional money will go to help homeless
This action neutralizes the success of Corbin's initiative on the attraction of young voters
The elevation of the State's office will fall upon those who don't pay taxes in Britain
The Ministry of Finance plans to get up to 120 million pounds a year for helping homeless
Today, Teresa May will announce that foreign buyers of British realm will pay a higher government mail, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action is considered to be an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbin's success in attracting young voters, as well as to provide an accommodation, which is directed to people with high income.
The elevation of the government's office is directed to individuals and companies who do not pay the taxes in Britain, while the money received will go to a government programme of housing without home.
Increasing the current state's office, including higher levels, taken two years ago, for buying other houses and housings for rent, could make up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13 percent of the new buildings in London are purchased by British residents, which leads to raised prices and new buyers are hard to buy their first apartment.
Many rich regions of the country, especially the capital, have become “grads-priests” because a large number of buyers are not in Britain for most of the time.
A new policy has appeared literally a few weeks after the invitation of Boris Johnson to reduce the state shelter for young buyers to facilitate the acquisition of the first apartment.
He accused major building firms to hold high prices at immunity by means of land capture and utilization, and called upon Mistress May to cancel quotas to the available housing to manage the "hudden position with housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a voting series of housing reforms, including rent control and cease "unsensitive" expulsion.
He also wants to transmit more powers to the local council in the area of housing building.
Mistress May said, "Last year I said that the dedication of my job at the post of the Prime Minister to the renewal of the British dream - life for every new generation should be better.
That means improving our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their life.
However, it is unfair that persons who do not live in Britain and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as employees of Britain.
For too many people, the dream of having their own home is getting more absent, and the problem of homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My primary ambition is to manage Scotland's Scottie"
The Sanderland Trainer, Jack Ross, said that his primary ambition would ever become a Scottish coach.
The 42-year-old Scotch is doing the job to restore the club from the northeast, which is now in the third place of the First League, in three points from the first.
He moved to this job in the summer after he returned St. Mirren to the Scotland Prime League last season.
"I wanted to speak for my country as a player.
But it failed," said Ross in the transfer of BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"I grew up, frequently sick of Scotland at the Hampden stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
However, this is the opportunity to appear when I'm a successful club trainer."
Among Ross' precedents at Sanderland's trainer's season, Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Alardays, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kin, Gus Poye and Paul Dí Kanya.
The former trainer Aloa Athletic said that he hadn't felt fear of such famous names in such a big club, previously denied the proposals from Barnsley and Ipswick Tawn.
"Now the success for me will be the answer to the question, "Can I be able to get this club back to the Premier League?"
Because of the structure and material database of the club's place must be in the Prime Minister Lisa," he said.
"It's not just to return it there, but I'll consider my job successful only if I can get back there the club."
Ross has only been a trainer for three years, before he was a trainer in Dumbarton, and he worked 15 months at the Harts Coach.
Then he helped Aloa return with the third League and turned St. Miren out a loser who nearly got to the Championship of the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his career in Clyde, Hartlpool, Falkirk, Saint-Mireen and Hamilton Academycal.
Recalling the work at Aloa, he said, "It was a really important choice."
"I really believed that the training work was what I needed, even more than a game.
It sounds amazing because I worked well, earned well and made some heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There's a lot of things to do every week.
I'm going through this right now when we're talking about stress and pressure, but the training work is what we need to do.
I've always wanted to train and I'm doing this now, and for me it's the best time of my grown life."

The hot summer increased the revenue of British pabs fighting for survival, but the pressure on the restaurants' networks.
According to the group's statistics, the sales and bars marked a 2.7 per cent increase in July, but in restaurants, the sales volume decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Consultative Business Group, who collected this statistics, said: "The long solar weather and longer than expected, the participation of English assembly at the World Championship in July meant that in June, if the sales were increased by 2.8 per cent, and here the restaurants suffered even more.
Sales decreased by 1,8 per cent in June, just deteriorated in July.
Rebridges and bars, which are mostly selling drinks until they showed the best score, unlike restaurants.
The hives that sell more food also burned in the sun, though not as much as the restaurant.
It looks like people just wanted to drink.
In the bars and selling bars, the drinks grew by 6.6 per cent, and the sale of food decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, a RSM analyst on rest and placement, said, "This is a trend that we see at the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social and sports events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
It's not surprising that the restaurants continue to fight, because sales decreased by 4.8 per cent per year, and it's very unpleasant when the cost is constantly growing.
The long and hot summer came in the worst time for operators who were concentrated on food, and the time will show whether the lower temperatures in August will bring such expected relief."
The total sales growth in bars and restaurants, including recently open, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowness in the deployment of brands.

Every fifth child has a secret account in social networks that it's hiding from parents
The study showed that every fifth child -- some only filled 11 -- has secret accounts in social networks that hide from parents and teachers
Study of 20,000 students in high school showed the growth of the Fake Insta pages
That news warmed fears that there were sexual contents published
Twenty percent of the students said they had a basic account showing to their parents
Every fifth child -- some only filled 11 -- makes accounts in social networks that keep in secret from their parents.
The study of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the "fake Insta" accounts, as if they were leading to the Instagram Photos Exchange website.
The news warmed the fears that sexual contents were published there.
Twenty percent of the students said they're running clean "basic" accounts to show to their parents and also conduct private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found out that she called on others to rape me.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the conference of independent school directors (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of adolescents between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of them admitted they had secret accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's very worried that so many teenagers want to make places online where neither parents nor teachers can find them."
Aileed Doyle will be the "sportsman's voice" at the Scotland Light Athletics Council
Ailid Doyle was elected at the Scott Council of Light Athletics as a observer of the council at the annual general meeting of this body.
Doyle is the most titled Scotland minor and the President Ian Beathi described this event as a great opportunity for those who are at sports, to get a lot of benefits from its experience at different levels, including international in the past decade.
"Aylid enjoys great respect in Scotland, Britain and the world's sports community, and we are sure that light athletics in Scotland will receive a lot of useful work in the council," said Biti.
Doyle said, "I want to act as a voice of sports and I hope I can help manage sports in Scotland."
A American who won gold at a distance of 200 and 400 meters at the Olympics of 1996 in Atlanta, and another two gold medals on other olympics, and who is currently working as an expert on BBC, can't walk after he survived the microscope.
He wrote on Twitter, "I've been through a blow a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it's only time to show if I'm going to do what degree.
It was a tough job, but I'm completely fixed, I've learned how to walk again, and now I'm doing exercises!
Thank you for the message with support!"
The ads of the milk pump where mothers are compared to cows divided on the Internet
The company on the production of milk pumps divided the assumptions by releaseing a advertising that compares feeding women with cows that are feeding.
To mark what they call the first milk pump in the world, the Elvie consumer company released an ironic music advertisement based on a video to show the freedom that this device gives the mother's feeding device.
Four real mothers dance in the scream with cows under a song, where there are words: "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have my tail," and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a wash, it's my chest."
And he said, "Come on, give, I feed the children, give, give, I give my wives."
However, the advertising on Facebook's Facebook website caused a hot discussion on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and the video response was unequivocal, many said it was a horror of milk production.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must get pregnant and be born to give milk, here are their children picked up in a few days," wrote one audience.
Elvie's milk pump is unseenly hidden in a boustgaltar for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "It's a traumatic trauma for both the mother and the baby.
But why don't we use them for a milk pump ad for mothers who don't take their children?"
Someone added, "So unprofessional advertising."
Others were defending the advertisement, and one woman wrote that the song was "funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd like to have one if I was feeding my chest.
The milk smoking makes me feel like a cow.
This advertisement was a little crazy, but I liked it.
It's a brilliant product," she wrote.
Another comment: "A very fun advertisement that's directed to mothers who suck milk pumpay (sometime at work or at the toilet) and hear themselves like "cows."
This advertisement does not excite or condemns milk industry."
In the end of the video, a group of women shows that they were all dancing with invisible milk pumps hidden in the busthalters.
The concept of the advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use milk pumps feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is totally soundless, has no strings or pipes, and is hiding uncertainly in the tubes for feeding women, gives women freedom of movement, allows children to be kept, and even leaves them at work of the tool.
Anna Balorin, a partner and creative director of Mother, noted: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a clear and provocative launch.
Running parallel between women feeding and mole crowns, we wanted to pay attention to the exclusion of milk and its difficulties, simultaneously demonstrating a funny and kindly way, as a new milk pump would bring an extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time that Elvie's milk pump falls into the center of attention.
During the London week of fashion, two children showed up on a diner dressed by Martha Yakubowski using this product.
Thousands of migrant children without noise to the tent camp on the Texas border
Although the number of borders has almost changed, the number of migrants detained rapidly increased, it is partly caused by a cruel rhythm and politics conducted by the Trampo administration, which has bothered the placement of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors are illegal immigrants who fear to threaten their own stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
The risks have grown significantly in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential sponsor and other junior household members would need to pass fingerprints and data to the immigration body.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-level Immigration and Customs Officer, made a report to Congress about the arrests of dozens of people who were looking for sponsoring minors without accompaniement.
Later, the agency reported that 70 percent of the arrested had no jurisdiction before.
"About 80 percent of those who are sponsors or members of their households are illegal in the country, and a lot of them comprise foreigners with a criminal past.
So we continue to persecute such people," said Mr. Olbens.
For a faster processing of children, the officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court for a month from the date of detention, so, according to the shelter workers, the standard term was 60 days earlier.
A lot of people will have to use video communications, not personally in the court to make a statement of their own immigration status.
Those who find no reason to help are quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and a message from the sources in the system that have appeared in the past months, the longer the children remain in prison, the higher the probability of depression or anxiety, which may lead to explosions of violence or attempts to escape.
Advocates claim that in more major institutions, such as Tarnilla, these problems are much stronger, since the signs of the child being in a hot condition will be more likely to be ignored because of the size of the establishment.
They add that moving children into the tent town without giving time for emotional training or farewelling with friends might make the trauma that many have already met.
Serbia requires an immediate withdrawal of the US, France and Turkey
In turn to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Valid Al-Mual, also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the war that continues in the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian land, on the basis of the fight against terrorism, and "will be treated accordingly."
"They must leave immediately and without making any conditions," he said at the meeting of the Assembly.
Mualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people had died since 2011, and millions had to leave their houses, "The war against the terrorism was almost over."
He reported that Damascus intends to continue "to lead this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
In Syria there are about 2,000 US soldiers who mainly play the role of instructors and advisors of the Kurds and Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar Asad.
The land contingent of France in this ruined war country is over 1,000 soldiers.
On the question of refugees, Mualem stated that the conditions for returning favourable and accused some Western countries in the “distribution of ironic fears” that contain refugees to abroad.
"We call upon the international community and the humanitarian organizations to contribute to their return," he said.
"They policy exclusively a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be renewed until the political agreement of war is reached between Asad and the opposition.
The U.N. diplomats reported that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major scale of the Idlibe Rebels had created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian and Turkish treaty prevented the widespread attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia in a province where three million people live.
However, Mualm emphasized that the treaty had "true terms" and hoped that military action would be directed against dżihades, including warriors associated with the Al-Qaida Nusra Front, which would "be destroyed".
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Missoura hopes to call for the first meetings of the new Bureau, which will be composed of government and opposition representatives to develop a sequential constitution for Syria and move the way to elections.
Mualem expressed the terms of the participation of the Syrian government in the Bureau, saying that the work of the Commission should be limited by "previewing articles of the active Constitution" and warnings against involvement.
Why the Tramp goes to the second term
In this logic, Mr. Tramp will win in the 2020 elections, where many liberal viewers, impeachment and scandal, hopefully, do not complete his presidentship.
And it will certainly be the "the very dramatic final of the presidentship for all history!"
At the moment there are no signs of tiredness of the audiences.
Since 2014, the first-time ratings grew more than twice to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nelsen, the Fox News in the average of 2.4 million viewers, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the transfer of "The Rachel Maddow Show" of the MSNBC channel gathered up at the screen of 3.5 million viewers and exceeded cable TV ratings at the evening when the main news was delivered.
"This is the fire to which people are coming, because we don't understand it," says Neil Barr, director of the ABC Drama "Reconsider" about a member of the Cabinet of ministers who becomes president after the attack that the Capitol destroyed.
In Nelley Scowell, a mascitated scriptistic comedies and authors of the book "A couple of funny details and a few hard truths about the invasion of Hollywood boys," there is another theory.
She mentioned a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Tramp.
- Why? - she asked.
He replied, "Because he's cheering me," said to me Miss Scuelle.
The chaos is precious yet that can make fun.
Of course, unlike all the other television, the story lines that come from Washington can become as definitive as the case of Wade, depends on whether the family of immigrants will be able to bring together and the health of the world's economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, when you watch a group of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward "information not for printing" in the book "Strach", Paul Manofort's jacket for 15,000 dollars with a strussy skin (clothing, remarkable, as wrote in The Washington Post), and the consequences of the sharp descriptions by Storm Daniels, anatomy of Mr. Tramp, it comes beyond a simple framework of wishing to be in the course of affairs.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario as before.
"The part of what he does makes you feel like you're watching the reality show that he shows every evening," says Brent Montgomery, executive director Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of "Pawn Stars" (Pawn Stars) about the changing actress of the Tramp show and the constant turnings of the story, "Sparring" from the NFL, the admiration of Kim Chen Yena).
You can't afford to miss even one episode, or you'll be out of trend.
When I talked to Mr. Flace this week, behind the windows of his house on the northern coast of Kawai was a hot sunday and 30 degrees warm, but he was sitting inside and watching MSNBC as he recorded CNN.
He couldn't blow off, not when Brett Cavanaugh rebelled before the Senate Court Bureau, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which was hanging on the hair.
"I remember the days when we were making these crazy shows, and people said, "This is the beginning of the west civilization," said Mr. Flace to me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

External currency flows enter a severe pre-selection race of intermediate choices into the representation chamber
It's not surprising that the 17th election district of Pennsylvania has overcome the cash bay thanks to the change in the borders of the Congress districts, and that's why two candidates are participating in the choices of one place.
The recently remarked Pitzburg nearby is surrounded by a democrat, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Conara Lamba, who won his seat in another district at the spring's elevations last spring.
Lambu is opposed to another acting deputy, the Republican Kit Rothfus, who presents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is much in line with the new 17th.
The maps were painted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the voices of the old districts were inconstitutionally accounted for the benefit of the Republicans.
The first-selected race in the new 17th district caused the decline in financing of the company by the financial groups of major parties, the Democratic Company Congress Committee (CCDC) and the National Bureau of the Republican Company (NCRC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a complicated victory in the broadly dedicated hospitals in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been taken by the Republican for over ten years, and the President Donald Tramp won a 20-point riot.
Political experts have a little preference for democrats.
The United States appreciated the possibility of execution of Salvador for supporting China and then retreated
The diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported the position of Beijing despite the slight opposition by Washington.
Mr. Tramp had a warm meeting with President of Panama Juan Carlos Warrell in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners moved the Tramp leadership team.
The representatives of the State Department decided to revoke the US diplomatic missions from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with the "new decisions on the failure of Taiwan", said the press secretary of the State Department of Heather Nauert at the beginning of this month.
However, the sanctions were considered only in relation to El Salvador, who received about $140 million of US aid in 2017, including drug removal control, development and economic support.
Suggested sanctions that include reducing financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions would be painful for the Central America country with its high level of unemployment and murders.
At the end of the internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a conference at a high level, dedicated security and economic prosperity, which would be a continuation of a similar meeting last year, which was considered as a step in efforts to prevent immigration in the United States.
But by the mid-September, the high-level representatives of the administration continued to understand that they wanted the conference to be held and actually stopped the examination of Salvador's punishment.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pension is now going to speak at a conference, which is appointed in the middle of October, in a sign that the administration is in charge of an event.
And three American ambassadors, without noise, returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new cruel messages or punishments from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues in terms of preserving anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by other analysts close to their administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Learn History
The next step can be the report of a special prosecutor Robert Mueller on possible obstacle to justice by Mr. Tramp, which is now a very difficult evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller pointed out in an investigation about the conspiracy of Tramp and Russia in the election attack.
When Congress will change the master, Mr. Tramp will appear to face responsibility to this body, just as he is preparing to speak again before the voters, and perhaps at the end, to the jury from the number of his colleagues.
There's a lot of "if" and I don't want to say that Mr. Tramp's fall is unavoidable as it is in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make a choice that determines how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were prepared for a state turn against Hitler, if only the West had sustained and supported Czechoslovakia in München.
We failed and missed the possibility of avoiding the next years of bloodshed.
The story is turning around this kind of breakdown moments, and the unpleasant democracy march is accelerated or delayed.
Right now, the Americans have encountered a few of these cross-border moments.
What happens when Mr. Tramp releases the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been in a difficult position since the paper was written that he proposed a secret record of the president's words and thought about his profability last year.
Mr. Rosenstein says the transmission of the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recent FBI investigation in the case of Brett Cavanaugh is not comprehensive or fair, or if he is claimed in the Supreme Court, despite trustworthy accusations in sexual violence and unfair indications?
And first of all, will we vote in elections for Congress, which will bring Mr. Tramp to responsibility?
If we don't get through these trials, for democracy will come a long winter.
But I believe we won't let go thanks to the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Hebrew who was deployed in the same Nazi regime that once bought my Ambassador's house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on this table with a swastique.
With such inheritance, how can I not be optimist in relation to our future?"

Graham Dorants from Rangers is optimistically set up for the day of the Vienna game
"Rapid Vienna" is accepted on Thursday, knowing that the winning over the Austrians after the impressive night in Spain over the Villeall at the beginning of this month allows them to leave the G League of Europe.
The triumf of the knee prevented Graham Dorants from speaking for the first time in the season by night 2-2 with Villiareal, but he believes that Rangers would be able to use this as a tramplin.
"It was an important match for us, because "Villareal" is a strong rival," a 31-year-old football player thinks.
"We started the game, thinking we could get something, and we earned a score.
Maybe at the end, we could have killed the ball, but the whole ball also became a good result.
They looked better in the first time, but in the second we took ourselves together, and we had the best half of the field.
On Thursday, there will be another important football night for Europe.
I hope we can earn three points, but it'll be a hard game, because they showed a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of rivals on the tribunals, I'm sure we can handle them and show them a good game.
Last year was definitely hard because of my injuries and changes in the club, but now we have a factor of confidence.
The team is a good team, and the guys are really enjoying the game; training is productive.
I hope we can move forward, get the results of the past season and make a success."
Women lose their sleep because of fear of retirement acquisitions
Despite the fact that the surveys had a precise idea of who they want to care for themselves, few of them talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the national study reported that they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about this with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take steps to discuss it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Life Insurance.
That's where to start.
Consider this with your husband and children: Your family will not be willing to help you if you advancedly distinguish your wishes.
Work with a consultant and a family and discuss where and how to get medical assistance, because this choice can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Drag to discuss a financial consultant. It can also help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy of long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy that helps cover these expenses or you can provide your own life -- provided you have money.
Solve the legal documents: predict judicial abortions.
Please be confident in the medical services to appoint a trusted person to control your medical services and to ensure that your wishes are performed by professionals if you can't talk.
In addition, consider the possibility of confidentiality to finance management.
Appoint a trusted person to make financial decisions and ensure your accounts' payments if you are inadequate.
Remember the details: Imagine that your older father needs immediate medical assistance, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about forbidden drugs and allergy?
Please fix these details in writing to be ready.
"There are not only financial matters, but also professionalism of doctors," Martin added.
"What are the drugs that need?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to plan it."

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami falling down on the Indian city of Paul on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected.
As a result of the disconnected humanitarian assistance, the officials were unable to get any information from the Dongala region, the area north of Palo, which is closer to the spectrum of the earthquake by 7.5 points.
In Palo, over 16,000 people were evacuated after a steady disaster.
Here are some key facts of Paul and Dongall on the island of Sulavesa:

The Federal Prosecutor requires a rare death sentence for a suspect in the terror in New York
The Federal Prosecutor in New York is in charge of a death penalty for Sipulo Saipov, suspected of a terror in New York, resulting in the death of eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old in October, seemed to have taken a drive by the Home Depot truck to hit a highway along the West Sideway in the Lower Manhattan, beating the pedestrians and the velosipedists on his way.
In order to justify a death sentence, in the intention report, there is a death penalty issued in the Southern County of New York, the prosecutors must prove that Sayipus "intentionally" had beat eight people and "intentionally" caused serious physical damage.
According to the matter of the court, for both offences, there is a possible penalty of death.
Several weeks after the attack, a major federal investigative jury faked Saipov's charge of 22 points, which included eight murder charges for supporting the nursery; this item is usually used by federal prosecutors in the case of organized crime, as well as the charge of violence and the destruction of transport.
According to the prosecutors, the attack demanded an "authorized and deliberate planning" and described the crimes committed by the Sayippai, used the phrases such as "offensive, cruel and disgusted".
"Saifula Habibuelievich Saipov caused trauma, caused damage and brought loss to the family and to the friends of Diego Enrike Cleves, Anne-Lary Decladt, Darren Drake, Arriel Erlio, Ernon Feruch, Ernon Diego Mendos and Alejandra Damien Pagnuk," says in the intentions.
The five dead were tourists from Argentina.
Since the last initiation of a criminal case with the penalty of a mortal punishment in the Southern County of New York has been ten years ago.
Officer Halid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but at the end, he was sentenced to residence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in New York for the federal case was applied in 1953 before Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs, a marriage pair, sentenced after two years before being sentenced for conspiracy for spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the cold war.
A couple of Rosenbergs were punished on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sayipup, a walker from Uzbekistan, according to the court documents, demonstrated the absence of the doctrine of conscience in days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said the next one that felt satisfied with his actions.
According to the prosecution, Sayipp reported to the authorities that he was inspired by a telephone view of the Islamic State.
He also asked for permission to hang the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital palace, said the police.
He doesn't recognise himself as guilty of the accused conclusion, which consists of 22 points.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders represented by Sovipov, said that they were "usually disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision of applying the death penalty rather than the consumption prison without the possibility of exemption, only extends the pain from these events for all the participants," said Patan.
The Protection Command of Soipov has previously asked the prosecutors to do no penalty.
The parliamentary member of Tora says that Nigel Faradge has to discuss Brexit.
Today, during the protest at the Tora Nigel Farage Party Party's conference, he swore to mobilize the People's Army.
Former leader Ukip said that politicians should "feel discomfort" from Europeans, since one of the members of the parliament, Teresa May, offered their EU negotiations.
The parliamentary member of the Conservatorial Party, Peter Bone, said while marching in Birmingham, that Britain would have already "exited" if Mr. Fáraz had taken the post of a secretary on Brexcit.
But the problem that Mrs. May had encountered, trying to reconcile her distracted followers, was even worse when the Torres who served for preserving membership in the EU took a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain a compromise Checker Agreement under constant pressure by advocates and exiters, as well as the EU itself.
The allies insisted on trying to make a deal with Brussels despite the negative response, and they wanted to make eurosceptics and leatherists choose between the package and the "nevolution".
Mr. Bone said at the mitting in Salihale, "Leave Means Leave", that he wants to "flick Checker off the board."
He suggested that Mr. Faroage made equal and set up obligations for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would have already left," he said.
The parliamentary member of Wellingbor added, "I'm for Braxit, but we have to leave Checker's plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We didn't lead world wars to be addicted.
We want to implement our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone refused to assume that the public thought changed after the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British had changed their opinion and wished to remain is completely inconsistent with the reality."
Brexit's admirer and Tora, Andrea Jenkins, was also on the march, and in a conversation with journalists, she said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
"The Checker plan is unpopular among the broad audience, the opposition is not going to vote for it; it is unpopular in our party and activists, who actually come out and pick us.
Please give up your plan and start listening."
In a sharp turn to Mrs. May, she added, "Premier ministers remain in position when they make their promises."
Mr. Faradge said that politicians should be forced to "feel discomfort" if they were going to betray the decision taken on the referendum of 2016.
"This is now the issue of trust between us - people and politics," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexita, and we're here today to tell them, "It won't come out of your hands."
In his turn to the excited crowd, he added, "I want you to make those politicians who are willing to betray Brexita feel discomfortable.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country, which gave us the victory in Brexis, and we never calm down until we become an independent, self-directed, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the exit officers went through Birmingham before conducting a two-hour mitting in the center of the city.
Several activists were waving into Tories Against Brexit after the week.
The Leiborist Peer Lord Adonis thanked the conservators for the security problems they encountered because of the party program at the opening of the conference.
"It's people who tell us that they can be ready to use the IT system and all technology for Canada plus, for a boundary without balls, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a full farce.
Such things as good Brexit. there is no," he added.
Warren is going to pay attention to the president's chat process.
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the elections in November, she "will pay close attention to the president's chat process."
"The Boston Globe" reports that a democrat from the state of Massachusetts told about its future on Saturday during a common meeting in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent criticist of President Donald Tramp, is going to reelect, opposed by a member of the Republican Party Jeff Dill, who was the Chairman of Trampo in Massachusett in 2016.
She was in the center of discussion as a possible Tromp's competitor in 2020.
Since Tramp's entry into position, it was the 36th meeting with the general meeting voters that went to Halioka on Saturday Day.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to speak to the president's position.
Warren replied that it was time for "wife to go to Washington to repair the broken government, and for that it should be a woman."
The arrest happened after the death of a basketballist Simms from the University of Louisiana
The Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect of the killing of a basketballist, Wade Simms, was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rose Police Control announced an arrest of 20-year-old Ditan Simpson during the press conference that went at 11 a.m. in eastern time.
On Friday, they published the shooting video and asked for help to identify the man who was on it.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot Friday morning at the South University campus.
"Wade Simms got a firewound in the head of whom he died," said on Saturday to the journalists of the "247sports" police chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wade followed a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson confessed to what was at the crime scene, was armed and shot at Wade Simms.
Simpson did not resist arresting and was taken under custody in the police office of the East Baton Rose County.
Sportsman-junior raised 6 feet, 6 inches (2001) grew up in Boton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games last season, from whom he was at a 10-year-old tour from the beginning, spent 17.4 minutes on the midst, throwing 5.6 points and 2.9 playbacks for the game.
Gran Pri Russia: Louis Hamilton approached the title of the world champion after the internal agreement gained a victory against Sebastian Fetel
Since Valtery Bothos was on Saturday in front of Louis Hamilton's qualification ride, it became clear that Mercedes' orders in the Mercedes team would play a significant role in the race.
Botos pulled out a good place on the barrel and nearly left Hamilton on the free of fate, until he defended his place on the first two religions and invited Fetel to attack his friend on the command.
The fermentation first went down to the pit-stop and left Hamilton flipping at the end of the common mass of the rabbits, and this maneuver was to be a decision-making maneuver.
The Mercedes pilot went on a pit-stop a circle later and came behind Fetel, but Hamilton came forward after a few cycle-in-coll maneuvers that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inside space free, risking to hold up after a double maneuver to defeat his third turn.
Max Ferstapen, on his 21st birthday, launched from the back series of networks and at the end of the first circle, was seventh.
Then he led most of the race until kept his tyres, for he wanted to finish quickly, to overcome Kimmy Rycanna and take the fourth place.
As a result, he went on a pit-stop on the 44th circle, but couldn't increase the speed on the rest of the eight circles, so Raycanne took the fourth seat.
It was a tough day, because Walter's all the weekend spoke fantasticly and expressed himself to the true gentleman when I was allowed to say so.
"The command has done an outstanding job to take the first and second place," said Hamilton.
It was really a bad body language
President Donald Tramp laughed at Senator Diana Fainstein's miting on Saturday because she insisted that she was not the source of the escape of a letter from Christine Blacey Ford, in which she accused the candidate at the Supreme Court of Breta Kawana in sexual violence.
Speaking of the west virginia miting, the president did not refer directly to the evidence for the Fords before the Senate Court Bureau, instead commenting that what's going on in the Senate showed how people can be "sucker, disgusting and untrusted".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate is if you see anger, if you see the wicked, the naughty and liar people," he said.
"If you read about press releases and escapes, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Finstein, is this your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document -- "Hey, hey, what?"
No, no.
There was nothing from me."
Wait a minute.
We made a escape... no, we didn't," he added, paradising the senator.
In July, Phinestein sent a letter with a detailed interpretation of the accusations made against the Ford against Cavan, and he ran early in September -- but Phinestein denyed that the escape took place from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't let her history escape," said the Fainstein Bureau, reporting the Hill.
"She asked the story to remain confidential and I satisfied her request."
But her denial probably didn't like the president who commented so on the Saturday mitting, "I'll tell you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but this is the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to protect the candidate from the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president assumed that the democrats were using accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain their power by any means.
You can see the devil, the fragileness, and they don't care who they hurt, whom they have to cross to get power and control," the words of the president, "Mediaite."
elite League: Dandi Stars – Belfast Jayants 5-3
Patrick Duyer killed two balls for Jayants in a game against Dundi
Dandi Stars played for the Friday wrestling that Belfast Jayants was given to them in the Ellite League, wining a back game with 5-3 in a home game on Saturday.
Thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boville Jayants were leading to two packs at the beginning.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney have equated the number before Dwighter restored the leadership of Jayants.
François Bushar with Dundi equated the number, and then Lucas Lundwald Neilsen two gales secured the victory command.
This was the third defeat in the Ellie season for Adam Kiff, who beat Dundy with number 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The commands met fourth season; in the previous three matches, Jayants won.
The first goal at the fourth minute of the match (03:35) killed the Duyer from Kendal McFall's array, and in four minutes Bavile doubled the number after David Rutherford's fall.
In a vivid first period (13:10) Sullivan opened a number from the masters of the field and then the Coun equated the number after the transfer of Matt Markward (15:16).
Dwighter provided the Jayant leadership at the first break, killing his second set for a meeting at the end of the first period.
By regrouping the side, Bush re-equalified the account by killing the chicken at the number of the command (27:37).
Kaun and Charles Carcoran helped Nilsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the end of the second period, and he provided victory with the fifth number of the team in the middle of the last period.
Giants, who have lost four of the last five meetings, have played the last game on a homecase against Milton Kaines on Friday.
The air car dies, saving hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
The air car in Indonesia died heroically, providing a successful flight of a plane with hundreds of passengers onboard.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared without news after a big earthquake on the Sulaves Island on Friday, which caused tsunami.
The strong underground strikes are still on, and many people are buried under fractures in the city of Paul.
While his colleagues were escaped by escape, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position at the dispatch board, which was hot at the airport of Palo Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He stayed in place until the ship 6321 of the Batik Air, which was at that moment on the airline, was blown out of the ground.
Then he jumped out of the dispatch, when he decided that it was destroying.
Later he died in the hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, the representative of Air Navigation of Indonesia, Yohanesa Syrite, the decision of the supervisor, perhaps saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Bolickpapan to Calmontone, which had to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning, before the helicopter flew to Paul.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
Meanwhile, the government of the country fears that the number of victims can reach a few thousand, and the agency's agency for reducing the danger of stiff disasters claims that access to the towns of Dongola, Siggy and Booton is limited.
The representative of the Agency of Sutop Purva Nugroch said: "The number of victims may still increase, since many bodies still have failed to dig out of the fractures."
The waves that reached up to six feet have devastated Paul where mass burying will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes will double humanitarian assistance.
The figure of Kusom, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News: "Each minute, a quick car bring bodies.
There's no clear water.
Things are broken everywhere."
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, reported CNN: "Indonezian Red Cross has a hurry to help survivors, but we don't know what they are waiting for.
It's already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
President of Indonesia, Jock Video, arrived to Palo on Sunday and said to the military, "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?', "Reports CNN."
Earlier this year in Indonesia, more than 550 people died from earthquakes in Lamboc.
Aviation accident in Micronesi: Air Niugini message one man passed out without a message after a plane crashed in the logo
Aviation company, which carried out a flight that took an emergency landing in the Pacific Logo in Micronesia, previously argued that all 47 passengers and the team were successfully evacuated from a plane that drowned and now declared disappearance without the news of one passenger.
The Air Niugini company stated in the press release that, at the state of Saturday, it cannot report the location of one man's passenger.
The airline said she was working with local authorities, hospitals, and the following to find a man.
The airline did not immediately report details of the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
The local boats helped save the rest of the passengers and the team after landing a plane on the water when they tried to land at the airport of the Chewk Island.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people were in the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were staying in the hospital on Saturday; they were all stable.
The reason for the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unexplicit.
By the statements of both the airlines and the US MS, the plane landed in the logo without flying to the landing bar.
But according to some witnesses, the plane jumped the passage.
According to the American passenger Bill Janes, the plane flyed very low.
"It's very lucky," Janes said.
He said he and others were able to climb the belt in the water to the emergency exits of the plane that had already drowned.
He said that the boardroads panicked and began to scream, as well as that he had received a little head trauma.
The U.S. MS reports that the seamen who romantized near the landscape also helped to rescue, using an overwhelmed boat to transport people to the shore until the plane drowned at a depth of about 100 feet (30 feet).
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people died in the crash of aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea for the last twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
The analyst restores the course of events in the night when the woman was burned by a living man
On Saturday, the accusation completed the presentation of evidence in the review of the case of a man who was accused of burning by the residents of Mississippi in 2014.
Analyst of the United States Ministry of Justice Paul Roulet has given evidence for several hours as an attracted expert in the information analysis.
He described the jury as using cell phone records to recover the movement of 29-year-old Qinton Telis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers at the night of her death.
According to the Clarion Ledger, he received information about the place from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers at the evening of her death, contrary to his past statement.
When his cell phone was near Chambers' phone while, according to his claim, he was with his friend Michael Sanford confirmed, the police were directed to apologize to Senford.
Senford gave a testimony on Saturday and confirmed that that day he was not in town.
When the defendant asked whether Telis was telling the truth that Sanford was in the van that night, he said that he was lying because my van was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was Tellis' claim that he was familiar with Chambers about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they knew each other in a week.
According to Rowlett, some time after Chambers Tallis died, he removed her messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
"He threw it out of his life," said Hayley.
A side of defense must begin arguing on sides on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be submitted to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: what is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio intends to condemn the negative view of this genre by filling his music with positive sets.
The High Breed, a group from the Christian, states that the hip-hop was distant from its sources: political statements and analytical questions.
They want to return to his roots and make a conscious hip-hop popular again.
The artists like Akala and Lowkey returned to a collection like the Fugees and the Common, the popularity in Britain.
Another black?!
Nanny from New York is going to court at a marriage couple for a "racist" message after release
Nanny from New York is suing for discriminating release after receiving an accidentally sent message from her mother with a complaint that she is "other black."
The couple denys that they are racists, comparing the sentences to "expulsion."
In 2016, Lyncy Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of the two children, expressed disappointment, discovering that a new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black, when she arrived on her first day of work.
"Noeeeee, one of the black ones," wrote Mrs. Plasko Flaxman in her husband's message.
However, instead of sending his husband, she twice sent Miss Morris' message.
As the New York Post reports, "feeling uncomfortable" was the one who fired Miss Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also African, had been doing a bad job, and she was waiting for her instead of the Philippine.
Miss Morris paid the day of work and sent home to Uber.
Now, Morris goes to court and wants to get a dismissal compensation in accordance with the conditions at which she was originally hired, even though without a contract: $350 a day for six months of residence.
"I want to show them that you can't do this," she said, "I know it's discrimination."
A couple refused to accuse racism, claiming that Maurice's dismissal was a reasonable decision, given that they couldn't trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent her what she shouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said Post, husband, Joel Plaska.
"And would you trust your children before whom you were dealing rude, even accidentally?
Your baby?
Is it?'
Plaska compares the invitation to "expulsion" and reports that his wife was born just two months ago and was in a very complex situation.
"And will you persecute a man in this position?
It's pretty hard," added an investment-bank specialist.
While judicial proceedings are still ongoing, the public thought quickly condemned a couple in social networks, criticizing their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not supernate the bear who speaks, said in the new sheet
The daughter of Bonda Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it first before it is published.
It's so curious to read, already knowing about the great success of Paddington."
She told her father, who worked as an operator of the BBC before he dared to write a book for children about a little toy bear, was optimistic, even though his work was not accepted and added that the 60th year of publication of books was "hore-sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father was thoroughly proud of his final success, talking about Poddington, who she described as a "very important member of our family."
"He was quite a quiet man, and not at all praiseful," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost parental pride for the child who had made something: you are proud of them, though it is not really your credit.
I think he was considering the success of Paddington exactly in such keys.
While it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave proper to the Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After her daughter landed, she was delivered to Louis Paster's Hospital 2, where doctors fought for her life for nothing.
"On the regular phone to tell you that it's really bad that she won't stand," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza.
"Then I called over to say that she would die for the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tassie, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The cures, which the doctors gave to beat her heart, slowly left her body.
She died a while ago, and it was the very end.
I just had to sit there knowing that it was all about it.
I couldn't scream or scream, because there were family and people around me.
I had to hold."
Lastly, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who was in the loss of her daughter, sat on a plane with other passengers -- and they didn't know what she had to do.
"No one knew," she said.
"I slopped my head and on my face all the time flowing tears.
It's hard to explain, but I was caught by Ned's sympathy in the flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he liked her."
Women who grieve cards to warn the suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their dear people who have committed suicide do everything they can to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphries are hanging cards on with warm words and phone numbers that people can get help on the Wales Bridge.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he had depression, and at 18, he was killed by suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel as I feel," she said.
45-year-old lady Davis, living in Lydney, said her son was a talented boss with an infectious smile.
"Each knew him smile.
People said his smile to light any room."
But before death, he quit his job because it was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11, found his brother's body when he killed himself.
Mistress Davis says, "I'm constantly concerned that this may have a disadvantaged consequence."
Mistress Davis created cards, "to make people know that there are people in the world who you can contact and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent - you need to talk."
Mademoiselle Hasfreys, who has been friends with Mistress Davis for a long time, lost Mark, her partner, who was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he was sad, or that he was in depression, or something like that," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude changed.
On the celebration day he was very depressed: when the children opened the presents, he hadn't even looked at them."
She said that his death was for them a great trauma, but we had to live with it, "The family had an enormous hole.
It's just killing us.
But you need to continue living and fight."

Being Breta Cavanaugh is uncertain because the FBI is starting the investigation
"I thought we could have what he wanted -- limited in time and in the range of investigation -- we could get a little merger," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was worried that the committee was "depleted" because he actually got into the traffic.
Why don't Mr. Cavano and his republic followers want the FBI to investigate?
Their unwanted explanations are sometimes explained.
Interim choices only five weeks later, on November 6th -- when the Republicans are expected to suffer defeat, then they will be weakened in their attempts to choose the Supreme Court of the Contributor.
George Bush called the Senator to promote Mr. Cavano's support, who worked in the White House during the Presidentship of Bush, and through him introduced his wife Ashley, who worked with a personal secretary of Bush at the time.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There's a vote in Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now held.
Until it's clear whether Mr. Cavano gets at least 50 votes during a voting in the Senate, allowing Vice-President Mike Pens to solve the problem of equality of votes and approve him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of winners dropped in Kim's leadership
The number of runners from North Korea in South has fallen since Kim Chen Yen came to power seven years ago, stated the South Korean official.
Park Bo Sun, who was bringing the South Korea Ministry of Communities, stated that last year there were 1127 runners, and in 2011, 2706.
Mr. Park stated that the main reasons are the strengthened border control between North Korea and China and the higher costs set by traffickers.
Phenyan never commented on this.
Most of the northern triggers have come to South Korea's citizens.
Seul claims that more than 30,000 North Korean residents have illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most people run through China, with which North Korea is the longest border, and it's more easy to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between two Koreans, which are very strongly protected.
China treats the perpetrators as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forces them to repatriate.
Relationships between North and South -- which are still technically in war -- have improved much over the past months.
At the beginning of the month, two countries leaders met in Phenyen for talks about denuclearization.
This happened after the historic meeting of the US President Donald Tramp and Kim Chen Yena in June in Singapore, when they agreed on a general period of work with the aim of completely liberating from the Korean nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Jan Ho accused US sanctions of lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such conditions we will not disarma the first," said Mr. Ri in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozi called Breta Cavano "the historian," she said he should not work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the Nancy Pelozi Palace named the candidate at the Supreme Court of Breta Kavano "the historian" and said that he was not in his temperament to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelozi said this in a interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the thought that if a woman acted like that, she would be called a "historic," Pelosi told me about their response to the Cavano talk before the Senate Legal Bureau on Thursday.
Cavano has emotionally opposed sexual harassment to Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his introduction speech, Cavano was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and couldn't speak when his family and the older school class were discussed.
He also clearly accused the democrats at the Bureau, named the accusations against his "gratesque and organized murders", organized by liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelozi stated that he believed that Cavano's speech showed that he couldn't work in the Supreme Court, because he clearly indicated that he had a prejudice against democrats.
"I believe that he discvalified himself by his statements and the way he spoke of Clinton and democrats," she said.
Pelozi denyed when she was asked whether she would try to make the Kavanau impichment when it was chosen and when the democrats were given most of the representatives of the Chamber.
"I'll say so -- if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or in the FBI, he should not only work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," Pelosi said.
At the moment, Cavano is the judge of the Colombian District Court of Appeal.
Pelozi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, it is disturbed by the potential decisions of Cavano against the law on medical treatment available or in the case of Row against Wade, because Cavano is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing on the confirmation of the Cavano post, he did not answer questions whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for hysterical, indifferent persons to work in court and expect us to say "as great," said Pelosi.
And a woman must do this.
This justified accusation speech, months and years of wrath just floods, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," 45 years ago, Mrs. Stanham told me.
"I don't think it's that rare."
She continued: "A woman who worked with the director somewhere helped me, and she said when she was mad, she was crying, but she was making a technique of behaviour, and when she was mad and crying, she said to her associate, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And I just kept talking.
I believe it was great."
The tears are partly allowed as a result of the sum, because they are absolutely wrong.
One of my most brightest memories from the first work I used to cry from an incredible anger, and I was caught by an older woman, a restrained chief who always scared me a little bit -- and pulled me in the stairs.
"Never let you be seen in tears," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that they led you."
Patricia Schrodar, at the time the Congress Democrat from the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential company.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt found a marriage traitor on a yacht called Monkey Business and went out with the presidential race, very angry Mrs. Schroedar figured that she could participate in the presidential company.
"It wasn't a very good thoughtful decision," laughing she told me 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates, and they didn't need me.
Someone called this situation "Snow and Seven Packages".
Since the company went a long time, she had no means, so she said she wouldn't take part in the choices if she didn't get two million dollars.
It was a failure situation.
Turns out some of her followers, who sacrificed a man $1,000, only gave her $250.
"They think I'm going with a smash?" she thought.
When she claimed that she would not be participating in the elective company, she was so emotionally captured -- thanks to people who supported her, anger to the system that has so complicated the gathering of money and aimed at the voters, not for candidates, and anger to sexism -- that she had a breath.
"You might think I've had a nervous breakthrough," Mistress Schroedar recalled the press response to her state.
"I thought my corporate sponsor was the manufacturer of the Kleenex paper suits.
I was thinking, what would they write on my supergrobal stones?
"She cried?"
Why the trade war between China and the United States can be good for Beijing
The first trading wars between China and the United States were deprived, and since the war is far from ending, in a farer perspective of disagreement between countries may be for Beijing's benefit, the experts say.
The U.S. President Donald Tramp fired the first warning at the beginning of this year, covering the taxes of the main export goods of China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week, when new tariffs touched a total of 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), actually covering half the taxes in the United States of China.
Every time Beijing answered this way, he raised five to ten percent of the US stock price of $60 billion recently.
China is a symmetrical response to the United States, and the second of the size of the economy is hardly going to lead.
To make Washington retreat, you need to deepen in the demand, but public agitation in front of the United States is practically unacceptable for the Chinese leader Si Cingpine.
However, experts say that if Beijing uses the situation correctly, the US trade war pressure in a far way can support China by reducing the mutual dependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that will start a rapid economic fall is much more dangerous than observers have thought before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher specialized in Asia, in the research and analytical centre of the new American security.
Serbia is ready to return refugees, said the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Serbia states that she is ready to return refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country destroyed by a war that lasted over seven years.
U.S. General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid Al-Mualem, said that the conditions in the country were improving.
"To date, the situation in the country is stable and safer, thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to return to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for returning refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and directed economic measures that were directed to improve their daily life and means of living.
The UN believes that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war in 2011.
Six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to rebuild a destroyed country.
However, he emphasized that the country would not take assistance in exchange for certain conditions or help from countries who were insulting the rebels.
Europe has won the Ridar Cube in Paris
The European team won the Ridar Cube in 2018 by winning the American team with a final number 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National field in Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in the European land and has not won the Ridar cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has received the crown when the Dutch Captain Thomas Bierne team has won 14.5 points necessary for winning over the US.
The American star Phil Michelson, who fought mostly for the tournament, put his ball into the water for three pairs of the 16th hole, decreasing Francesco Malinari's match.
Italian golfist Malinari played great at all rounds by making one of the four players who passed this field with 5-0-0 from the start of the tunis in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spis was slain with five and four players with the lowest rating in the European team, Thornbirn Olsen from Denmark.
The world's top player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 Ian Paulter from England, who may have played in his last cup of Rydar.
The Veteran of the eight Raidar's cups, the Spanish Serhia Garcia, has become a player who has the most winning tournament with 25.5 points of career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't hold on today.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to return the cup.
The whole thing is about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said the thrilled Garcia after the winning of the European team.
He handed the estaphet to his landlord John Ram, who played the legend of American Golf Tiger Woods on Sunday in the single 2&1 matches.
"I'm very proud to win Tiger Woods, a man who was careering since I was a child," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four mates in France, and now he has the record number 13-21-3 in Rydar's cup.
The amazing statistics of one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 main titles and stands on that point only from Jack Niclaus.
The American team struggled with himself except Patrick Rid, Justin Thomas and Tny Finans, who played throughout the tournament of a high-class golf.
American Captain Jim Fury said after a disappointment in defending his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're tales.
This morning we sometimes showed Europe what we could do.
We fought.
Take off the hat for Thomas' honour.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the American Golf Association and our Bureau of Rydar's cup, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud I'm their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We're out."
