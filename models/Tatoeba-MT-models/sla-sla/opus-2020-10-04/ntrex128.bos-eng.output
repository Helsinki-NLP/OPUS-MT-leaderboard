Welsh members of the congregation are concerned about similarity with "Mapetas"
Some members of the congregation are overreacted because of their proposal to change their title into "members of the Welsh Parliament" (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the name of the congregation into the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the congregation throughout the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could be a subject of laughing.
One lab member of the congregation said his group is concerned "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers van Wells: In the Welsh twp, it means foolish, and pwp means an asshole.
The member of the political party's Assembly, Plaid, said that the group generally "is not satisfied" and proposed alternative titles.
The member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "opened" on a change in the name, but he noted that there was a small difference between the MWP and Mupetovc.
In this context, the excuse of the welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the letter in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission currently working on the draft law on the introduction of a change in the name said: "The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of the members of the congregation will, of course, bring to the members themselves."
The law of the Government of Wales in 2017 gave the Assembly authority to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public debate on proposals resulting in a great support for the appointment of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of the members of the congregation, the Commission has given priority to the name members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the highest support in the public debate.
The members of the congregation are allegedly giving alternative proposals, but the efforts to achieve consensus could cause headache to the chairman, Elin Jones, which is expected to pass on the draft legislation on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other amendments on how the congregation works, including the rules on the disqualification of members of the congregation and the plan of the Commission system.
Members of the congregation will have the last opportunity to vote on their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians go to a referendum on a change in the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to "Republic North Macedonia".
The national vote has been organized in an effort to address a multi-decidal dispute with neighbouring Greece with a province called Macedonia.
Athens already claims that the name of their north neighbour is the hostage of its territory and resists its demands for membership in the EU and NATO pact.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite to change the name, said he won't admit the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the amendment calls a simple price they must pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bell on St. Martin has shut down while the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The older people I have spoken to say there were bars and churches once on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"None of them today."
He said the extinction of bars was understandable.
"People hang out today differently," he said.
"Bars are no longer a quarterly living room where people go regularly."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not take as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later, he will return where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by housing buildings with apartments full of people who won't help preserve the remaining quarter sanctuary.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that will accelerate the closing of these churches because it is unlikely that people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolitan – the Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original community of white methodists moved out in the 1930s.
The Negro community that served nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's church was taken over by the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was leading the trader boycot on 125th Street, the main trading street in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of black people.
In 1939, the fire had severely damaged the building, but as the pastors of Father Johnson made a plan for reconstruction, they ordered organs.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of father Johnson and his heir in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organs "the poor bells."
The expert who played the organs in July called them differently: "cultural treasure" and "insequent historical instrument."
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organs in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to a larger organ in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said the Church of St. Martin has not found his replacement.
What happened at St. Martin's Church for the last few months is a complex story of architects and entrepreneurs, some of which have brought church leaders and other bishops.
The Bishop Administration – the Governing Body of the Bishop, composed of church chiefs – wrote to the bishop in July, expressing concern that the Bishop will "urge to transfer expenses" to the Bishop's administration, although the Bishop administration was not involved in renting architects and entrepreneurs sent by the bishop.
Some mayors complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the bishop.
The shark hurt a 13-year-old man while hunting lobsters in California
The shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old boy while he was hunting lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster hunt, officials reported.
The attack happened something seven hours ago in the morning next to Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said about KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday with his friends dived about half an hour when he heard the boy who called for help and then he took him and helped to get him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was an excitement to catch the lobster, but then "he realized that he screamed "She bit me!"
She slaughtered me!'
His whole key bone was broken," Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water, 'The shark is in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Council's Paediatric Hospital where his condition is being taken critically.
We don't know what kind of shark attacked him.
Captain Larry Giles, savior, said in the media address that the shark was already seen in that area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to belong to a dangerous kind.
Giles also added that the victim had received traumatic injuries in the area of the upper troop.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there were more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most of them were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's becomes a competitive competitive chain of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to cosmetic products in the style of store houses in which expert assistants work.
As part of a significant breakthrough on the beauty market in Great Britain worth 2.8 billion pounds, which are increasing while sales on fashion markets and house equipment decline, larger cosmetic departments will be tested in 11 shops around the country and will be extended to more shops next year if they are successful.
Investing in cosmetic products comes because supermarkets find ways to use the police used once for television, microwave ovens and home equipment.
Sainsbury's said he would double his cosmetic assortiman by offering more than 3000 products, including products of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing palette of brands L'Oreal, Moilline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in suits similar to those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket will also restart its make-up line by making most of the products suitable for vegans – something increasingly demanding for younger customers.
Furthermore, Fragrance Shop's perfume store will test the sales places in two Sainsbury's stores, of which the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping on a network and moving towards daily shopping of small foods in local shops means that supermarkets must invest additional efforts in order to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Sainsbury's chain, said that shops would look more like a store house in the effort of supermarkets to retrieve the stroke to the chains with large discounts of Alda and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened shops Argos in hundreds of his shops, and also introduced Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased the sale of food products and profitability of procurement.
The previous attempt of supermarket to modernize its departments of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has ended unfamiliarly.
Sainsbury's tested a joint business with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended up arguing about the division of revenues from pharmacy in their stores.
The new strategy entered into force after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281 pharmacy to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's chain, said: "We have transformed our appearance and experience of our beauty departments to provide our customers a more pleasant environment.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be in hand to give advice.
Our brand assortiman is designed to satisfy all the needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an unexpected destination of the beauty market which sets new standards in the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "anger" after Holly Willoughby retired from a deal worth 11 million pounds.
The Star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, was "anger" after Holly Willoughby's television leader retreated from a deal with his personal brand worth 11 million pounds to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for his brand household and extra equipment for Truly.
The company of this couple is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The director of this Morning (37) announced its departure through Instagram.
Holly WIlloughby angered the star of Dragons' Day Peter Jones by withdrawing from their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on its new retail contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources stated that Jones was "anger" when a golden girl of TV admitted, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1,5 million pounds, mean no more time to devote their homemark and additional equipment to Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop, and it was expected to double the fortune of Willoughby's wealth estimated on 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, published his leave on Instagram, Jones flew from Britain to one of his houses.
The source said, "Holly put Truly in the top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would ensure her profit in the next few decades.
Her decision to retreat intimidated everything involved.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday, it was so close to launching.
In Marlow's seat, there's a lot of products ready to sell."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning emission leader, one of the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions because of huge investment in broad product assortiman, from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, and possible additional deferrals of the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined in March as the director of the company.
The couples go to vacation together and Jones has 40 percent of the Baldwin production house.
Willoughby will become an ambassador of the M&S Brand and replace Anth McPartlin as the leader of the ITV show I'm A Celebryty.
The source close to Jones said last night, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Tough words, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the account of the criticism he could receive from the media because of the comment that could be described as "unpresidency" and for a positive position on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump drop so much?
Trump said with his joking voice "News Reader."
"I didn't give up at all."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a big step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations stopped.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, the high Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders and the UN's Main Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see "suitable response" by the United States to the original steps of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the United States continues to sanctions whose aim is to maintain pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his talk at the meeting.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We have been a step from the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have great relations."
He said his efforts to fix relations with Kim brought positive results - by suspension of missile tests, release of hostages and return to the death of American soldiers.
And he stood in defense of his unusual access to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to behave presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this full arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing on the world in front of him.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations have been told that their assistance is not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of the Lombok Island has been placed, no state of national disaster is declared, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, so it will be quite difficult," Mrs. Sumbung said.
While the Children is composing a team to travel to Palo, they are still not sure if foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials assess the situation on the island of Palo to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in providing assistance.
In view of the permanent earthquakes in Indonesia, it is sad how unprepared this country is to the anger of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, they do not often see each other in other parts of the coast.
Apparently there was no cunami siren on the island of Palo, although the warning was in force, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal terms, travels between many Indonesian islands are a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
The hospital ship in Lomboc to assist the victims of earthquakes is on the way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to get to the place of a new accident.
President Joko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving the Indonesian producing infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, a lack of funds has affected Mr. Joko's administration while he expects new elections next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure because of long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been displaced because of the street fights of Christian and Muslim groups who used machetes, ports and arrows and remained primitive weapons.
Look: Liverpool Footballer Daniel Sturridge put a deep, equitable hit against Chelsea's football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing in the Premier League in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri on some 30 yards from the naked Chelsea Club while his team was losing 1:0.
He transferred the ball to his left side, and then he threw to the outer stativa.
The ball flyed high above the criminal space, turning to the top right corner of the network.
Finally, she fell over Kep Arrizabalg, who was jumping and falling into the network.
"It was only to position, to receive the ball, and players like Shaq always go forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time," Sturrudge told Liverpool FC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once, and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 half-time after the Belgian star Eden Hazard reached a hit in the 25th minute.
The blue attacker added the ball to Mateu Kovačić in that fifth attack before he ran from the middle of the field to Liverpool's half.
Kovačić quickly touched and returned the ball in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, leading Hazard into a criminal space.
The gambling was faster than the defense and ended close to the statistical, putting the left leg into the network outside of Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights against Napoli in the group phase of the Champion League at Wednesday at the Stadium of San Paolo in Neapoly, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in Europe's League on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian cunamie reached 832
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami have risen to 832, stated the state disaster agency early on Sunday.
A number of people in the ruins of buildings that crashed the earthquake of 7.5 which happened on Friday and raised waves high and up to 20 feet, said the spokesman of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at the press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by the remains of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a man (32) after a woman was stabbed deadly
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead this morning in the area of Merseyside.
Forty-four-year-old girl was found stabbed at 7:55 in Grayson Mews Street, and 30-year-old man was arrested suspicion of committing murder.
The police called people nearby to see or hear something to answer.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in early stages, but I'm calling everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially cabs, who might have recorded some cameras on the car control panels, to contact us because they may have information that is important to the investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed the woman whose body was found from Birkenhead and found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman arrived in the face of the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police stated that the victim's family was being informed.
A taximan living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost the text when he found out what happened.
The inhabitants are now told that they will have to wait hours before they are allowed to go back inside.
They heard the cop told one man that the whole zone was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the crime scene in tears.
She repeated, "This is so horrible."
At 14:00 two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van right next to me.
A large number of police officers were inside the police cordon watching the apartment building.
Everyone who has any information has been invited to directly contact @MerPolCC, calls 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111, citing the case 247 of September 30th.
The statue of Cromwell in parliament has become the latest monument in the middle of the arguing about the "revision of history"
Her removal would represent poetic justice for destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England, performed by his puritanian followers in the manner of Taliban.
But the company Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "insane" and "to try to revise history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the context of the current debate on the elimination of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell was also a target in front of the palace in Westminster.
Cromwell hasn't ordered or conducted an iconism during English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the works of his ancestor Thomas from the past century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Thorneycroft is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of the character for which many others believe that he should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said about The Sunday Telegraph: "Mnogy consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a parliament defender from external pressures, in his case of monarchy.
Is this entirely true is the subject of a permanent history debate.
What is sure is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century has formed further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognized character representing one side of that division.
His achievements as the Lord of the Protectors are also worthy of glory and remembrance."
The pig killer caused death injuries to the Chinese farmer
The pig attacked and killed a farmer in the Southwest China market, local media reported.
A man, who was only known to be named Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood in a pig market in Liupanshui in the area of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig was preparing for pigs to inject vaccine in pig on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He allegedly arrived with his cousin from the neighbouring area Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the neighbouring pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig with blood around his mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a pig of a weight of 550 libra caused death injuries to the farmer, as indicated in the report.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and split," said a cousin who presented his name Wu, Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera record shows Yuan who came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
The market manager said to Evening News that the pig was locked up in order to prevent the attack on other people while the police collected evidence in place.
Yuan's family and market owners are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it was rare, the cases of a pig attack on people have been recorded before.
The pig attacked her wife and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 pounds had a welsh farmer with his tractor until his wife scared and expelled her.
After the pigs ate the oregonic farmer in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the blood taste can act as a trigger.
"They're just playing.
They like sticks, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa brings widespread plugs in the southwest of the United States
As foretold, the hurricane Rosa weakened moving over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods due to plugs across northern Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa's first-categorical hurricane winds reached a speed of 85 miles per hour of five hours in the eastern time on Sunday and was 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a rural gap in the Pacific is formed and moving to the east and west coast of the United States. As the tropical storm Rosa approaches the Baya California half island on Monday, it will start pushing tropical moisture northwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain into Mexico's parts on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture together with the arrival of the arrival will create widespread plugs in the southwest in the next days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, nanosis and possible slippers in the desert.
The high tropical moisture will result in drops that will reach placemically and 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest edges, especially in the largest part of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of sudden deterioration of weather conditions and typical dispersions of tropical rain.
The walks in the desert would be extremely unreasonable with the danger of tropical rains.
Many rains in canyons could result in wild rivers, and thunderstorms are placemistly strong winds and sandstorms.
The arriving jare will bring placemic flashes on the parts of the southern California coast.
There are possible total declines of over half a inch, which could cause nanoses and slippery Augusts.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Rooms of dispersed tropical plug will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes wider later on Monday and Tuesday.
The plugs will also reach Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, there can be large fluctuations of temperature throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes colder, and the tropes remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
There is an excellent example of a dramatic difference in the temperature in the central United States on Sunday.
The difference in the temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omahi, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the remains of summer heat will try to buy and expand again.
The beginning of October will be warm in most central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures of approximately 80 degrees from southern plains to northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term forecast announces a great possibility of temperature above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people were watching Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people saw on Thursday the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in front of the high court and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly happened in 1980, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political resistance continues, with emitters who interrupt regular broadcast due to the latest interference on Friday: the agreement that Senator Arizona Jeff Blake made with the FBI agency on a one-week investigation of the charge.
Ford told the senate judicial committee that a hundred percent is sure that Kavanaugh was touched and tried to discharge at the high school party.
In passionate confession, Kavanaugh said that a hundred percent is sure that it didn't happen.
According to Nelsen, this must have seen more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company computered CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The numbers were not available immediately to other networks that broadcasted it, including PBS channels, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nelsen usually has difficulties with the recruitment of people who follow the transfer from the office.
In order to be more charmed, it's an audience similar to the one followed by football eliminator matches or Oscar's allocation.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led to other networks with a average number of audiences of 5.69 million during the whole day hearing, said Nelsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million audiences.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.2 million, said Nelsen.
Interest is high after the hearing.
Flake was a central drama character on Friday.
After the office of a moderate republican announced that they would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS network camera recorded the recordings of the protestors who cried at him after he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial committee.
He was standing a few minutes screwed up while he was insulted, with a live transmission on CNN.
"I stand here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, there was more to say at the commission hearing.
Cable and television networks have been transferred live hours later while the judicial committee voted whether to forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate to a vote.
But Flake said that it would only be done provided that the FBI explore the charges against the appointed next week, what the minority of democrats calls for.
Flake was partly convinced to talk to a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few more senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's choice was important because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened a FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused criticists of playing policies about Brexito
Prime Minister Theresa May accused criticists of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing policies" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in the Sunday Times interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conservative party's conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In her second interview on the journal cover, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal was that Britain and the EU would take customs from each other "as absolutely absurd".
Wayde Simms murder: the police arrested Dyteon Simson, suspect of the death of the LSU player.
The police arrested the suspect in a fatal shooting that killed Wayde Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player of the LSU Club.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and detained under charge of second-step murder, said Baton Rouge's police administration.
The officials published a video record of the fight between Simpson and Simpson and the police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
The police took the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB network CBS reported.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said he admitted to kill Wayde.
His guarantee is $350,000, said the lawyer.
The corporate of the eastern area of Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gun shot from the head and neck.
The department stated that the credit belonged to a police working group for Louisiana refugees, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police, and the inhabitants of the area that helped during the investigation that led to arrest.
The Sports Director of LSU Joe Alleva thanked the district law enforcement agency for "triality and pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The attacker was 6 feet high and 6 inches grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player in the LSU club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per match.
Friday morning's basketball coach of LSU Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
"This is what we're constantly worried about," Wade said.
The volcano expels ashes across Mexico City
The ashes vomiting the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Protection warned the Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after the volcanic activity in the crater increased and after 183 gas and ashes were registered at 24 hours.
The center was tracking more earthquakes and turmoils.
Pictures on social media show a thin layer of ashes that covers windwave cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noticed an increased volcano activity located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since the quake of 7.1 hit Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police conflicted with catalonic separatists at the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after protesters, independence supporters, confronted with the special police team, when thousands of people joined the contrasts on the celebration of the polarising catalonic referendum on vaccination.
A group of masked separatists, held by a special police force, shot them with eggs and colours in dust, making dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later during the day, there were also breaks with the police who used the pendrakes to suppress the fight.
Independence supporters scanded "No forgets, no forgiveness" for hours and struggled with Union supporters who cried "Live Spain".
Fourteen people have received medical treatment for less injuries they have received in protests, the local press reported.
The tensions are still high in the region which has been assigned to independence a year after the first October referendum that Madrid declared illegal but which catalonic separatists of glory.
Many voters have chosen independence to the huge majority, although the output was low because the opponents of the moocho occupied the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the voting of violent conflicts across the region.
Independence teams camped on Friday night in order to prevent demonstrations and support the national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he is no longer optimistic about catalan independence.
"We have experienced one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry from happiness because they were allowed to vote, but now we are in scream," he said.
Although they took the key, but close victory in local elections last December, the catalon parties that support independence had difficulties to keep their inflammation because some of their most famous leaders were in a self-infilled exile or in custody, expecting a trial for their role in the organization of the referendum, and then pronouncing independence.
Joan Puig, a forty-two-year-old automechanist who recorded a police support demonstration on the phone, said that politicians on both sides supported the conflict.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalonic leaders, who was in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidature in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidation in European elections is the best way to condemn the implication of democratic values and repressions imposed by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car wrapped into the house
Three men (33, 34, and 39) were arrested after they freaked into the house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place on the street of Ballynagar Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 by British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at one point the car was shot from the arrow.
Menge hits Livingstone won 1:0 against Rangers.
The first goal of Dolly Menge has secured Livingston's victory.
An advanced Livingston surprised the Rangers and noted only another loss for Steven Gerrard in 18 matches of the Ibrox club.
The naked Dolly Menge was key, while Gary Holt's club was equal to Hibernian in the other place.
Gerrard's club has not recorded any guest victory in the Premier League of this season and will play against the first-classed Hearts for which eight points remain next week.
Before that, the Rangers will accommodate the Rapid of Vienna in the European League game on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended a series of wins in the League on six matches, and Chief Coach Holt has not experienced a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the chances against the guests missing acute.
Holt's team was supposed to be leading a long time before they gave the naked because their direct game was very troubled for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke himself, but his attempt went past the naked, then Alan Lithgrow tried to go through the naked after he slipped to get the ball Craig Halkett's head to the naked.
The hosts were responsible to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for guests from free hits.
And that's how the key naked is achieved.
It was convicted by a free blow against Rangers, Livingston made a passage, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Manga, who received the ball and hit from the middle of the criminal space.
Until that moment, the Rangers dominated the ball, but the defense host remained unprone and the goalman Liam Kelly had no much trouble.
That form continued in the second half-time, although Kelly had to intervene for Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman stopped the goal foot of Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow was throwing too wide from another free hit for Livingston.
The crasses were constantly arriving into the Livingstone's criminal space and were constantly defended, while the two penals they asked – one after a faul against the substitute player Glenn Middleton, and the other for the game with hand – were not allocated.
"Fenomenal Game" Livingstone – Analysis
Newsman BBC Scotland, Alasdair Lamont is in Tony Macaroni arena
A fantastic game and the result of Livingstone.
Everyone's been great to one, and they continue to overcome the expectations on the east path.
Their game style and players have almost changed since their return to the top, but great credits belong to Holt who gives her energy to the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading an excellent organized defense, while Menga made peace to Connor Goldson and Joe Worral through the whole match.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As long as they were good under Gerrard's stick, they didn't reach that level.
The last strikes were missing – only once they broke through the host's lines – and this is a kind of call for awakening for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Kelno
Saturday (September 29th) was in sign of smile and blue sky while Turkish and Germany leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit to President Erdogan to Germany, whose aim is to correct NATO allies' relations.
They broke up on issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Keln to open a huge new mosque.
This is a city in which most Turks live outside Turkey.
The police indicated security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposing Erdogan -- many of them Kurds -- were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
Double protests reflect the division of the guest's views that some German Turks glorify as a hero, while others dislike him as a autocrate.
Traffic accident in Deptford: The bicycler died in a car crash
The bikeman died in a crash with a car in London.
There was a crash near the Bestwood Street crossway and Evelyn Street, on the road in Deptford, in the southeast of town, about 10:15 by British time.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance team intervened, but the man died in the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after the second bikeman died in an accident where the driver left the scene of the accident, at the Childers Street, which was about a mile away from the place of Saturday accident.
The london police said they were working on the identification of the victim and the family information.
The streets are closed, the buses are redirected, and the drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officials injured in mess
Six prison officers have been injured in an irregularity in high security prison for men, said the prison office.
The riots exploded in prison Long Lartin, in the area of Worcestershire, on Sunday around 09:30 in British time and still last.
A special team of Tornado officials was invited to calm down the mess in which eight protectors participated in a single wing of prison.
The officials got less injuries in their face and their help was provided in the face of the seat
The Prison Administration spokesman said: "We have compared specially trained prison personnel dealing with an incident in prison of Long Lartin.
Six staff have received medical assistance for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and have made it clear that they will be responsible for this to the police and could extend their prison sentences."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison manager was received for hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a special unit was invited to prison for serious mess in which staff were attacked by billies.
Uragan Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (what can be useful in areas covered by drought)
Rarely when tropical depressions affect Arizona, but that's exactly what is very likely to happen at the beginning of the next week, while the hurricane Rosa is going through the desert southwest regions, carrying the risk of flood.
The national meteorological administration has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and South and East Nevada, South East California and Utah, including Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and its approach will be announced on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Administration in Phoenix pointed out in Twitter that only "the ten tropical cyclones since 1950 kept the status of the tropical storm or depression in a circle of 200 miles around Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest projections of the National Hurricane Centre foresee two to four inches of decline and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In the other parts of the desert southwest, including the centre of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, it will probably be 1 to 2 inches and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In parts where there is no fear of flood, Rosa's rain could be a blessing because the area was hit by drought.
Although the floods are a very serious problem, one part of these falls will probably be useful because the southwest is currently hit by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Surveillance Agency, a little more than 40% of Arizona was hit in the least hand by extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First of all, the hurricane Rosa will lead to a slippery at the Mexican Half Island of Baya California.
Rosa, who will still have a hurricane on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenea in Mexico and will move at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will come to the coldest waters of the Pacific, and that's why it's going to begin to lay.
Therefore, Mexico is expected to hit by the force of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Plugs in Mexico parts could be very strong and can be a big risk of floods.
"The total declines from three to six inches are expected from Bay California to Northwest Sonora, and perhaps even up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then go north across Mexico with the force of the tropical storm before it reaches Arizona early morning Tuesday in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and South Utah on Tuesday late night.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her restraints is a large rainbow in Baya California, Northwest Sonora and the US Southwest Desert," said the National Centre for Hurricanes.
These flashes are expected to cause buill floods dangerous for life and invasion in deserts, as well as slippers in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempting murder
Three teenagers and twenty-year-old men were arrested under suspicion of attempts to kill after a 16-year-old man was found stabbed in Summerset.
A teenager was found injured near Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday about 4 hours in the morning at British time.
He was transported to the hospital, and he's in a "stable condition".
Seventeen-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested in Radstock, said Avon and Somerset police.
Officials are appealing to the people who have any video of events on their mobile phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has suffered infancy and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The voting for judge Kavanaugh is a voice against a cruel and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Whelling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has suffered maliciousness and anger" of the democratic party during the nomination procedure.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress Thursday, strong and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he had sexually attacked a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing of her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw glow, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most real legal minds of our age, a lawyer with great achievements in the public service," said the band of supporters in West Virginia.
The President touched Kavanaugh's appointment directly when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans at the middle of the mandate elections.
"Five weeks from the most important choices of our lives.
Although I'm not running personally, I'm actually running," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates on all sides."
Trump claims that democrats seek to "fetch resistance and interference".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not later than Friday, the high official of the Republican Party for CNN said.
Hundreds have lost lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number is still increasing.
At least 384 people died, many of them were picked up by huge waves that hit the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Sulawes Island, the authorities said on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered together because of the beach festival in Palo on Friday when the waves were up to six meters (18 feet) hit the shore in the dark, bringing many to death and destroying everything they had found on their way.
Cunami followed the earthquake of power 7.5.
"When the threat of cunamia was published yesterday, people were still dealing with their jobs on the beach and did not escape immediately, and they have been killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesian disaster sanctioning agency, in turning to Jacarda.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he wore cars, balls, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 miles per hour (497 miles per hour) before he hit the coast.
Some people climb trees and survive, he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in Palo.
The photos of the air, issued by the disaster agency, show a number of destroyed buildings and shops, accumulated and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Thresholds continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit the area in which 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in the statement that the energy of a huge earthquake was 200 times larger than the power of the atomic bomb thrown on Hiroshim in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city that was located on the edge of a long, narrow bay has increased the strength of the cunamic, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "abundant" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, sales centres and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found under ruins of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage could be bigger along the coast of 300 miles (190 miles) north of Palua, in the area of Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of earthquakes.
Communications "was completely cut off without any information" from Donghala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," they said in the Red Cross in the statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become even worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticised for not reporting that cunami hit Pala, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur records divided on social networks show a man on the top floor that panically warns people on the streets underneath about coming tsunamis.
In a few minutes, the wall of water hit the coast, carrying buildings and cars with him.
From Reuters, they couldn't confirm the authenticity of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused the absence of electricity that cut off the communications around Palua, making power rescue effort harder.
The army started sending cargo aircraft with humanitarian assistance from Jacarda and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian flights and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to evacuation centres in Paluo on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian cunamie rose above 800.
It's very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision must have arrived from Donghala in Palo, where employees were located in tents raised in the courtyard of the office, they witnessed the scenes of destruction on the road, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to take first steps in reducing the disaster, there was a complaint that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of foreign funds, supplies and people is only possible if the scene of accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster of the provincial level," said Aulia Ariani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'all right, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international assistance, but that status is not yet declared."
While the second night on Palo falls from the earthquakes and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their earthquake story in this natural disaster will be reduced.
Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who was buried under ruins next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paraglaiding team, trained two missing paragladers in front of the Asian games ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others captured in Roa Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As an older member of the paraglaiding team I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that hours after the news of the destruction of the hotel Roa Roa broadcasted the circles of the paraglader desperately sent whatsApp messages to the competitors in Paluo who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one grey quarrel, instead of two blue quakes.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26.750 while filling bankomates in Newport complex on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thiefs stole 26,750 dollars from a Brink employee who filled a bankomat in Newport on the Levee, according to the Newport police report.
The car driver was emptying a bankomate in a fun complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
The witnesses saw more suspects fleeing from the spot, standing in the statement, but the police did not precise the number of people involved in the incident.
Everyone who has any information about their identity needs to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: reper changes the name in Ye
Reper Kanye West changed his name in Ye.
Publishing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "It will be previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been known for a while as Ye and has used the name for his eighth album, published in June.
A change occurred before his show in the Saturday Night Live show, where the promotion of his new Yandhi album is expected.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer who canceled the show for "emotional reasons", the author of the show said.
With the abbreviation of his current professional name, West said earlier that this word has religious importance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," West said earlier this year while discussing the title of the album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It came from Kanya, which means only Ye – which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more reflective of what we are."
He's one of the many famous repers that changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names of Love and Brother Love.
Former West's associate, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without a line and a large letter.
AMLO in Mexico has sworn not to use the army against civilians.
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he will never use military force against civilians while the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that "he will never use the army to conquer the Mexican people."
The army fired peaceful demonstrations on the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at the time the left student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to provide support to young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational possibilities push young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in that field, said the investor and the practical artificial intelligence in Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments arrived after the various parts of the American authorities issued an announcement of artificial intelligence, although the United States generally do not have an official strategy in the domain of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China published its plan last year: their goal is to be first in the domain of innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, taking into account that all other countries are much behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the domain of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The double funds could double the chance of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee said in an interview for the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Supersile Art Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most extensive art intelligence companies in China, Face++.
He worked at the University of Carnegie Mellon in the 1980s on a system of artificial intelligence which proved to be more superior than the most ranking American Othello Player, and later was the executive director at Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the earlier technological competitions of the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for advanced defence research projects, and asked when the next competitions could be identified by future visioners.
Researchers in the United States often need to make enormous efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"We don't have China's academic leaders, that's what corporates do," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have been employed by brilliant university individuals to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the United States to strengthen their efforts in the domain of artificial intelligence.
"I think they should automatically offer green cards to the doctorate from the artificial intelligence domain," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan for the development of an artificial intelligence of a new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences provides subsidies to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Scientific Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Defense Division formed the Joint Intelligence Centre, which seeks to include partners from industry and academic community, and the White House published the formation of the Election Committee for Art Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Scientific Foundation, it currently invests more than 100 million dollars a year in research of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the American legislation that tried to form the Commission of National Security for Art Intelligence has not done anything for months.
Macedonians vote at the country's referendum
Macedonian citizens voted on the referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step to address a multi-decedental dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO Union.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that their northern neighbour's name is the hostage of its territory and has veto to their entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments have reached an agreement on the proposed title in June, but nationalist opponents claim that this could endanger the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote at the referendum, and the Boycott campaign placed a question whether the referendum would be a minimum of 50 per cent required to make the referendum valid.
The question on the voter list was: "Do you have a membership in NATO and the EU with accepting agreement with Greece."
Name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries, has resulted in a fall of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entering bodies like the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live freely within the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgievska (79) said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally mandatory, the sufficient number of members of the parliament has said that it will be managed by the results of the vote and that the result will be decisive.
The two-third majority of Parliament would be required to change the name.
The State Election Commission stated that there was no report on irregularities until 1:00 p.m.
However, the output was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the voters came to the elections.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," José Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje, said.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško voted at the Macedonian referendum on a change of name, which could open their way to NATO membership and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30th 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and dragged chairs in front of the tents that were split up by those who would boycot the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the upstairs heads, not the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor but proud land.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European community."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring necessary investments to Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is higher than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the great majority will vote "for" because it is more than 80% of our population for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the insertion of the tickets.
He said the result "for" would be "confirmation of our future".
A survey published on Monday at the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says that the referendum will participate between 30 and 43 per cent of voters -- which is below the necessary output.
According to the second survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57% of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
From that number, 70 percent said they'd vote "for".
In order to be successful, the referendum requires a 50% output plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious strike to the Western government since it came to the government last May.
Look: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero is walking through the entire defense of Brighton and reaching naked
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling relieved the defense of Brighton in victory of 2:0 Manchester City against Brighton at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero reached the naked in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defense players before he found himself in the open field.
Aguera then surrounded three green dresses.
He pushed around one defense player and he was faster than a few more on the edge of naked Brighton.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English attacker used his first strike in the criminal space to return the ball to Aguer, who right-handed over the goal of Brighton Matthew Ryan by hitting the right side of the network.
"Aguero had some problems with his feet," Coach City Pep Guardiola told the reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what it was.
We're lucky he's reached naked at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave the heavenly blue the primary advantage of the Prime Minister's League.
He reached the naked in 29th minute.
In that action, Aguero received the ball deeply in Brighton's part of the field.
He gave Leroy Sane a great deal on his left side.
Sane touched a few times before he sent Sterling to the naked.
The Sky Blue attacker put the ball in the net before he slipped out of the field.

Scherzer wants to play a game without competitive significance against Rockies
Since Nationals was eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But the competitive Scherzer hopes to take a position on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a game of advantages over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, are still in excellence.
Rockies at least have a direct passage because of the victory of 5:2 against the Nationals on Friday, but they still try to win the first title in the League.
"Although we don't play for anything, even though we can go to the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams will be probably at the highest level than all these years.
Why don't I want to compete in these conditions?"
Nationals still need to publish the starting team on Sunday, but they are allegedly willing to let Scherzer throw it in that situation.
Scherzer, whom it would be 34th time to start the game, trained on Thursday and will throw on Sunday when he usually rests.

Trump held a meeting in West Virginia
The president briefly addressed his candidate's election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he talked about the importance of the Republicans' elections at half the mandate.
"All we've done will be at stake in November.
We're five weeks from the most important choices of our lives.
These are one of the great, big -- although I wasn't running, I'm actually a candidate because I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "See these horrible, horrible groups of radical democrats, that's what happens right now.
And they are determined to return power using all possible ways, you see evil, dirty games.
They don't care whom they will hurt, whom they will go over to the power and control, power and control are what they want, and we will not give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are in the mission of resistance and disturbance.
"And you have seen it in the past four days," he said, calling the democrats "anger, evil, evil and unfair."
He referred to the democratic senator and the member of the Senate's judicial commission, Dianne Feinstein, by name which caused the audience to disturb loudly.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document go public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting -- it was really bad tongue of the body -- the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer accepts different attitudes.
It's intolerable to those who express their opinion
When activists of the Momentum in my local branch of the party voted to censure me, I wasn't surprised at all.
Besides, I am the last in the series of lab members of the parliament which have been told that they are not welcome, and all because we have expressed our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she decisively opposed anti-semitism.
In my case, the censors criticised me for disagreement with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and it is ironic that these are similar problems about which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The notification from the Labour Party's meeting in Nottingham East, held on Friday, says "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the eight years I spent as a local labour member of the parliament, meetings on Friday night were mostly such.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not like that, and the promise of politics "better, more gentle" has been forgotten long ago, and the question is whether it has ever been.
It has become more obvious that different opinions are not tolerant in the labour party, and every opinion is estimated on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leaders of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when the colleagues I believed that we share similar political attitudes, began expecting me to make turns by 180 degrees and I take the views that I would never agree with, whether it was a national security or a unique European Union market.
Every time I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- it is accompanied by the insults on social networks, calls for disposal from the party, convictions of the centre policy and tells me that I should not be in the labour party.
And that's not just what happens to me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments to me are mostly political nature.
I'm impressed by professionalism and determination of colleagues who daily deal with sexist or racist insults, but they don't retreat.
Something that disappointed me most in this political age is how these levels of insult became normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the labour party should nurture the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different views and by every voice of untrustedness or by changing the rules of selection of the parties.
I've got a lot of advice, and for the last two years, I've been instructed to move my head, to be less loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since 32 years ago, as a student, I joined the Labourist Party, provoked by the negligence of the government of Prime Minister Thatcher, which has literally demolished my primary school, I have been trying to support better public services for those who need the most, either as a local council or minister in the government.
I've never hid my policy, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would have told you that when the country is scattering towards Brexit that would compromise households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand why anyone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the labour party.
But the main message I have is not to the Momentum in Nottingham, but to the voters in my electoral unit, whether the members of the Labour Party are or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise you that threats by removing me from the party or the political scumbag will not prevent me from acting the way I think it's in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr on top
Two late attempts may have somehow distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr took the deserved victory in this exciting game of the day in the Tennent's Prime Minister League.
Now they're on the top of the table, the only unbeaten of ten teams.
Finally, the home team won the victory thanks to the superior defense, as well as the number of exploited chances, and Coach Peter Murchie had reasons to satisfy.
"We have been tested in the games so far, and we are still indefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayra's every honor, they've used their chances better than us."
The attempt of Grant Naderson in the 14th minute converted by Frazier Climo has given the advantage of Ayra, but the yellow card for the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who was let by the Warriors to play, allowed Melrose to use the numerous advantage and Jason Baggott caught an unpreformed attempt.
Climo has increased the leadership of Ayr before, just half time ago, he has achieved a solo attempt to hit the result of 17:5 for Ayr in half-time.
But the second half-time Melrose started well and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggot, reduced leadership to five points.
There was a long break because of the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, who was brought out on the carpets, and Ayr continued to increase the advantage of the attempt of Stafford McDowall, who turned Climo.
Deputy Captain Ayra, Blair Macferson, then got a yellow card, and Melrose reused the numbered superiority with an unconverted attempt of Bruce Colvin, after the period of severe pressure.
However, the hosts came back and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because of a faul over Clim without ball. MacPherson reached a touch down from the penalty line behind the coming mole Ayra.
Climo turned, like he did it almost from the beginning of the continuation, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's hit into a criminal space and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth host's attempt.
The star of the series Still game is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still game, Ford Kieran, is preparing to move into the guest industry after learning that he was appointed Director of the Licensed Restaurant Company.
A fifty-six-year-old player plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC series that writes a scenario and plays together with his long-year partner in comedies, Greg Hemphill.
Two men announced that the next nineth season will be the last in the series and it seems Kiernan is planning life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he's the director of the Adriftmorn Limited company.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to be involved in "raising restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours," Bolivia, who has no way out to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
Marines are patroling the seat in La Paz.
In public buildings, the ocean blue flags are flying.
The maritime bases from Lakes Titicac to Amazon are sticked with slogane: "We have the right to sea.
Return to the sea is our obligation."
Throughout the land of Bolivia, there is still a strong memory on the coast they lost for Chile in the bloody circulation of natural resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be the biggest in the last few decades, while Bolivia expects the verdict of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of council.
"Bolivia has caught an inflammation, in the spirit of unity and joy, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the verdict of the international court of justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will judge in favour of Bolivia and claims that – after decades of challenging negotiations – Chile must agree on negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here's Morales, the carismatic bolivian president of the native origin, who is in the arrival of a controversial struggle for the next year, also plays a great role in the verdict that will be brought on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is a little likely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that a little of it will change even if it decides.
The United Nations body with a headquarters in the Netherlands has no power to allocate the Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict is expressed only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have reversed him.
"The problem of the sea exit has been grabbed by the current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morales' war-born rhetoric killed the rest of the Chilean goodwill, it pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations in one moment, but it will be very difficult to hold those negotiations after this.
These two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Weltze, a Bolivian representative in Hague, refused the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring a "excellent opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance "to put a point on 139 years of disagreement to mutual pleasure," he said.
Calzadilla also denyed that Morales -- still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America -- uses the issue of sea exit as a political stack.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people will not remove nuclear weapons until they trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He invited the United States to respect the promises of data during the summit in Singapore between conflicting leaders.
His comments arrived at the moment when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be at the border to restart nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and meeting with Kim Jong Una from North Korea.
Ri says that it's just an empty dream that the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the US declaration that ends the Korean war will ever throw North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree with the declaration until Pjongjang has made significant steps towards disarmament.
And Kim and American President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, the government is universally skeptical when it comes to Pyongyang's seriousness with regard to denying the nuclear arsenal that this country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the second summit of Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion magazines present the latest lines of huge hats that you will soon see in the nearby trading street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or fully cover the sun, you're in the right place.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of disgusted huge hats on their spring and summer 2019 tracks, shadowing everything at the Paris Week of Mode.
Extraordinarily irregular hats won Instagram this summer, and these designers showed their impressive creations on the fashion tracks.
The most prominent piece of Valentine was a hat with a wide pearl shelter that swallowed the heads of the model.
Among the other gloss supplements, there were barleys with a beautiful stone, a wizard's hat, and even ananas, but their purpose is not to keep your head from cold.
Thom Browne also presented the collection of bizarre masks and that just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had lips wet, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high-fashioned.
One of the creations looked like diving equipment with a breathing and mask, and the other reminded of a corn with a melted ice cream.
And if you're among those who follow the trend of attracting attention, you're lucky.
Those who follow fashion predicts that huge hats can be found on nearby trading streets.
The huge hats came after the "La Bomba", a slammed hat with a two-foot hat that was seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
Cultural brand that created this very irregular hat that flooded social networks, sent on the track another large creation -- a sacred beach bag that was large as much as the model that was wearing.
The exhaustive rafia bag and white skin lunch was a highlighted detail of Jacquemus La Riviera's spring collection and summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous Luke Armitage Stillist said for F.S.E.: "I expect the large hats and bags for the beach to arrive in time for the summer, since the designer has made such a huge impression would be difficult to ignore the demand for pre-dimensional fashion supplements."
John Edward: Knowledge of language is crucial for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can be commended by extraordinary academic achievements, which continued in 2018 with a new series of extraordinary results in the tests, which is further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools representing the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), they seek to provide the best level of services to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further and more education, selected career and place in society of citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own class plan and program, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable student election object in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that understands it fits his head.
If you talk to him in his tongue, it's good for his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of the tests this year, we see that languages are at the top of the league tables, with the highest passage rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of the students who learned foreign languages received an estimate A at the final high school examination.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students received an evaluation A from the Mandarin language at the final examination in high school, while 72 per cent of those learning German, 69 per cent of those who learn Spanish and 63 per cent of the Spanish also received A evaluation.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Languages, as electoral objects, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, machinery and mathematics) and in independent school programmes, and in other places.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons employers have given to the difficulties of filling jobs is the lack of those who know foreign languages.
So knowledge of foreign languages becomes increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future career.
With more potential jobs that require knowledge of foreign languages, this skill is necessary in the world of globalization.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if he knows another language, he will have a real advantage in the future because it's a skill for life.
The art of direct communication with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person speaking more languages in front of competition.
According to the YouG survey carried out among more than 4,000 British in 2013, 75 percent have not been able to speak the other language enough to talk, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, investment in learning foreign languages is important for children today.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in economies in development, will give children a better chance to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to learning languages.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for Great Britain by 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child is, there will always be several languages from which they will be able to choose in independent schools, with professional teachers in this area.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to the education environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed for success, whatever they are expected in the future.
At this time, we cannot deny that in the global business environment languages are key to the future of the country, so that it must reflect in education.
Modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debit for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting soon ends for fans who want to see LeBron James's first show for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play Sunday in a pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes they're gonna play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at the official location of Lakers.
The reporter of Lakers, Mike Trudell, Twittered that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about plans in six games during the Lakers Pression.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need seasonal swords to prepare myself," he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a series of elections tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings in the next week, including visits to friendly intense places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his vote is awaited to fill out a void in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because the Republicans are risking to lose control of Congress after the vote in November.
When is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how can you look at it on the network?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia was scheduled for seven hours tonight in eastern time, on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia under a live transfer on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearing this week about the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court in which it was tense for sexual disturbance charges, and the expected vote in the Senate was delayed in seven days until the FBI conducted the investigation.
But the excellent goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans achieve better results in the elections in November.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that the meetings are held this week to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters' information.
"Control of Congress is so crucial part of its agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter the pre-electoral campaign season," the Reuters spokesman of Trump's campaign that refused to present.
Appointed at Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's meeting could gather supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia, a state in which he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is not well in the surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to raise his score in surveys," said Simon Haeder, politician at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters' report.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team has shown coherence to keep hope before individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, four of them on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The zamah of the battery is a completely invented concept in sports, but one of those in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, who's got a blow right now?
"They were driving six points, and now four, so it can be said that the blow on our side," Jordan Spieth said on his way away.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points more, with another twelve in the game.
The Americans, as the Spieth says, still believe that they have some wind in their wings, and there is a lot of encouragement to them, including the other forms of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each took three points of possible four.
Spieth was brilliant from the first to the last strike and leads his example.
The screaming of the celebration became increasingly loud during his round, to eventually play a key hit for the unsolved result in the fourth match when he and Thomas stayed behind for two after two.
His final strike with a 15-hole match was welcomed by a similar shout, the one reflecting the faith that the American team has hopes.
"You just have to do everything you can and take care of your sword," said Spieth.
That's all that's left to these players now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the main story of Ryder Cup.
An unusual, but irresistible European couple has won all four matches and plays without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't play gods hits on Saturday afternoon, and they escaped them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game they showed so far and the way they exchanged energy with the noise audience has been strengthened at the position of the main favorites on Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take the potential European victory while the sun is coming over the Le Golf National Club.
The best would be both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still early to talk about European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly conquered Sergei Garcia, a hero of four balls that morning, when he played together with Alex Norren.
One godly punch and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and the Sweden in a hole from which they never managed to swim.
However, on Sunday no one can help you get out of your hole.
Games with four balls and four are so fascinating to look closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give and they don't give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great advantage before the final day, but this fourth session also showed that the US team has a desire to fight that some have suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day Ryder Cup
In the last Ryder Cup, Europe will enter with a significant advantage, since after the Saturday matches in the game with four balls and fours, it has achieved the advantage of 10:6 over the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the first with two victories over the unnatched Tiger Woods, increasing the current results in the Le Golf National Club at four points.
The Europeans of Thomas Bjorn in battle to restore the trophy lost in the Hazeltine golf club two years ago, dominated over the unprecise Americans in the morning game with four balls and won a series of 3:1.
The United States has given greater resistance to the fourth tournament, wining two matches, but they could not reduce the removal.
The team of Jim Furyk has to win eight points in 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debitant who won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after the fantastic weekend, only the second couple in Ryder Cup history who won four points in the first four matches.
After they hit Woods and Patrick Reed in a game with four balls, they were greatly composed and overcome the tired Woods and the American debitant of Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, who walked through two matches on Saturday, shineed for a moment, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in the game with four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who rested during the morning game with four balls, returned to his partner Henrik Stanson at the fourth tournament and suffered the defeat of Dustin Johnson and Broox Koepka – the first and third in the world.
Europe still did not work according to the plan of this pleasant day southwest of Paris.
A triple conquer of the main tournament Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They have chosen a victory of 2:1 over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game with four balls, to later beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in fours, after they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder's history, a team returned after a four-point removal in front of individual matches, although Furyk's side defending the title is a sufficient unsolved result to keep the trophy.
However, since they've been two days in the second place, they seem to be unable to carry out an attack on Sunday.
North Korea recommends that there is no talk about unilateral disarmament unless there is trust
North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that prolonging sanctions deepens her confidence in the United States and that in such circumstances the country will not unanimously renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu, at the UN's annual General Assembly, said that North Korea has taken “significant measures in the past year to show goodwill”, such as nuclear and missile testing, nuclear demonstrations and promises that they will not multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But, there is no appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and there is no talk about the first one-sided disarmament."
Although Ri repeated the famous complaints of North Korea to resist Washington's "step" approach to denuclearisation by which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, the importance of his statement was that he did not reject a unilateral denuclearisation from the game like Pyongjang before.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current US President and North Korea leader on June 12th in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea's security guarantee.
North Korea is looking for the formal end of the Korean war (1950-53), but the United States announced that Pyongjang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also deafed the invitations to mitigate international sanctions to North Korea.
"United States do not give up the 'denuclearisation first of all' and increase the pressure of sanctions in order to achieve their goal by force, even opposing the 'pronouncement of the end of the war'," said Ri.
"The opinion that sanctions can put us on our knees are the empty dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that extended sanctions deepen our untrustedness."
Ri has not mentioned plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader spoke in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If we negotiated this problem with the denuclaring with South Korea, rather than with the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not come to such an expensive position."
However, the tone of Ri's speech dramatically differed from the last year, when the UN General Assembly said that the shooting of American land with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "racetash" on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year "to completely destroy" North Korea, he praised Kim for the courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that many more things should be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea conducts denuclearisation.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not set a time frame for this, saying, "If it takes, let it take two years, three or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongjang for the steps they have taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council sanctions must continue to be strictly and without releasing to implement until the complete, final, confirmed denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea, which have been applied since 2006, in an attempt to prevent the financing of nuclear and balistic missile programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ree van of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for another summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
In July, Pjongjang left with the words that progress was made, and North Korea sentenced him only a few hours later for the exposition of "gangster demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would unmount a rocket polygon as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "suitable measures".
He said that Kim told him "suitable measures" required by the security guarantee Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard attend the course about how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to force students to sleep more in an effort to eliminate increasingly popular macho culture of learning "all night with caffeine".
One academic noticed that the university of the world's leading university is often ignorant about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard's Medical Faculty and a specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course that he believes is the only one of those types in the United States.
The inspiration to launch this course was given after the speech he held on the impact of the lack of sleep on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this just now, in my graduate year?"
She said no one ever told her how important a dream is -- that surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course that is held this year for the first time represents the basis of how good sleeping habits contribute to better academic and sports results, as well as to improving their general state.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatric professor at Harvard's Medical University and executive Director of the University Health Service, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was noticed that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course covers a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of room in a student's home and students should click on cups for coffee, curtains, shoes and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of the lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of routine before sleep.
In another part, participants have been told that long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, brain attack, depression and cancer.
Then the map of campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not change the behavior of the students at the moment.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what effects on health has the decision to smoke cigarettes," Professor Cheisler said.
The culture of pride because of the "bearing night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technologies and increasing pressure on students have led to a growing problem with the lack of sleep.
The sufficient amount of sleep, and the quality, should be a "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against a surplus kilogram, since the absence of a sleeping brains is going into a hunger regime, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a nineteen-year-old chemistry and physical biology student in California, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after he attended one of his lectures during his first year at Harvard last year.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to be in favour of his maintenance at the whole campus level.
He hopes that the next step is that all graduates will be asked to pass a similar study programme before accessing a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students think about setting alarms in time to sleep and wake up and take care of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lights and can disturb the circadianic rhythm, leading to a problem with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengin goal defeated Gerard's team
The Rangers experienced another depressed defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga shocked the team of Steven Gerrard to defeat from 1:0 of Livingstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to take the first victory in guests after the February triumph of 4:1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only made Gerrard the second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the unattainable leaders of the League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time, and the uninspired Rangers figures never came near the equation.
While the Rangers were now falling to the sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third and they were behind Hiberniana only because of the goals of the difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after the linear judge Calum Spence had to show assistance when he was thrown by side by a subject.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that got over Ayr and flyed into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was assigned to the same eleven Livingstone players who took the point of Hearts last week and would be thrilled by the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have dominated the property of the ball, but Livingston has better used his time with the ball.
It was a little missed to achieve a naked only two minutes after Menga first added to the empty space sent Scott Pittman to the naked Allan McGregor, but the player in the middle of the field missed a great chance and kicked by the naked.
The deep free blow of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow just managed to kick next to the naked, the end of the statistical.
Rangers succeeded in taking control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he was supposed to get a penalty in 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers only hit two goals in the first half, but the former golfman of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, with no bigger problems, defended the head of Lassana Coulibaly and shortened the shot that directed these Ejaria.
Although the first naked Livingstone in the 34th minute may not reflect the real relationship of forces during the game, no one can dispute that he was deserved, if nothing else, then because of the invested effort.
The Rangers couldn't deal with the deep free blow of Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard responded to an interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly and that replacement almost gave the result immediately when the wing player hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran out of his line and blocked him.
However, Livingston continued to incite guests to play exactly as they fit, with long balls of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had a chance to increase the advantages in the last minutes, but McGregor was holding up and defending Jacobs' attack, so that Lithgow would then send a ball by the naked corner.
The substitute Rangers player, Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, asked for another penalty when he connected with Jacobs, but Thomson did not respond again.
Almanah: Inventor of Geiger's Counter
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning: on September 30, 1882, on today's day 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactiveness, an invention that will eventually become a device known as Geiger's numerator.
Except that one of the main science bases, Geiger's counter has its place and in pop culture, as in the "Bell of Coronade" film in 1950, in which seemed to be the incredible cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these phones on, you can hear your ears the effects of atoms thanks to radioactivities in minerals."
Evans: "Yes, it's a pucket!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that wears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" vicious cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" vicious cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize vicious cells as part of therapy
The procedure includes the withdrawal of immune cells from patients and their changes in the laboratory
They can "see" protein that is common in many types of cancer, and then they get injected again.
The test vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
The cancer of a woman's egg who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the vicious cells, disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their lab relapse so that they can "see" protein HER2 and reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the American Institute for malignant diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "supports growth of several types of cancer" including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and colorectal, explained professor Berzofsky.
Similar approach to the withdrawal of immune cells from patients and the "learning" of the same way to target malignant cells was effective in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a tough speech to support Trump, carrying the MAGA hat, after his show in the SNL show.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was accompanied in a study during the Saturday Night Live show after a great show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song called Ghost Town, that night he was wearing a hat with a "Do America Great", he insulted the democrats and spoke again about his support to Trump.
"I talked to the white men so many times, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
So if I had cared about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL started a sketch show in which Matt Damon played and where the Hollywood Star laughed at the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate's judicial committee on the claims of sexual disturbance by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcasting, the video of West's speech was divided by a comic Chris Rock on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock tried to laugh at West by putting the video.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind his hat.
"They were teasing me behind the tower.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
They were kidding me!
And then they say to me I've fallen down," he said, according to Washington Examiner's instructions.
West continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" added that "would wear Superman's coat because that means you can't order me. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments caused the audience to whistle at least twice, and the members of the SNL show were apparently ashamed, Variety transmitted, while one person who was present said, "The whole studio has completely silent."
West was brought in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, reper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many by the performing of the song and hunting it broken into the bottle of Perrier.
Westa supported the TPUS Conservative Group leader, Candace Turner, who was saying, "One of the most brave souls: thank you for not withdrawing from the violent."
But Karen Hunt's director, she was just saying, "West was what he was really is and that it was absolutely beautiful."
"But I choose not to reward someone (as I'm going to buy his music or clothing or support his "art") for whom I believe he has embraced and expanded the ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
And we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying that now he's "will be previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and tracked the footsteps of Diddy, who was also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A colleague Snoop Dogg called Snoop Lion, and of course a dead music legend of Prince changed his name into a symbol, and then to "a artist previously known as Prince".

Kit Harrington condemned the toxic macho culture
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who beats the sword in a violent Mediterranean fantasy, the HBO series Game of the throne.
However, an actor (31) fell on a stereotype of the hero macho, saying that such roles on the screen mean that the boys often think that they should be rough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of the toxic macho of culture at the time #MeToo.
Kit who recently married a partner from Leslie Rose's throne Game, 31, admitted that he had a "potential need" to deal with this problem.
"I am personally disturbed at the moment – what have we made wrong with representing manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for spreading the toxic macho culture for showing characters represented as men.
He continued, "What is born, and what is the matter of raise?
What's what they teach us on TV and on the streets, why do youths think they have to fit into a certain form of man's behavior?
I think that is, in fact, one of the main issues of our age -- how do we change it?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for youths."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not agree on the preconditions or continuations of the throne's game after the end of the summer, saying he "finished with battlefields and horses".
The Kit will be acting in Sam Shepard True West in November, story about the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently discovered that he believed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened in the game of the throne.
"In this series, I met my wife, so it can be said she gave me the future family and my life from now on and on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love partner of Kitt's character John Snow in this fantastic series that won Emmy's prize.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/side: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, health officials say.
Some 40,000 new cases were noted only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, which is a change in relation to the previous situation.
In the past, HIV rapidly spread to some parts of China as a result of the transfusions of the blood infected by the virus.
However, the number of people who receive HIV in this way is almost zero, the Chinese health officials said at the Yunnan Province Conference.
However, from year to year, the number of people in China who live with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000 people.
Transfer of HIV through sexual relations is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been considered illegal since 1997 in China, but they say the discrimination of LGBT people is very widespread.
Studies estimate that because of conservative understanding in the country, 70 to 90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually get married to women.
The transmission of the virus is often due to irresponsible sexual protection in such relations.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denyed the allegations that one of her staff published information about the Republican Senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "theory of conspiracy"
American Ambassador Maxine Waters denyed that one of her staff published the personal information of three American Republican Senators on the Wikipedia pages of those legislators.
The Democratic Ambassador from Los Angeles claims that these claims are placed by experts and websites "Ultradisnicary Wing".
"Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a publication on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of American Senator Lindsey Graham from South Caroline, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
Information appeared on the network on Thursday, and the unknown person in Capitol Hill was published during the hearing of the Senate's committee on the instructions on sexual disturbance against the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was released sometime after three Senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of publications related to the Waters' office and published information about her staff, said Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely incorrect and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are in danger because of these false and incorrect claims – is not in any way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely incorrect and absolute lie."
The statement of Waters soon caused a conviction on the Internet, which was also issued by the former White House's press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial goes in anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she has no temperament required for a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
He can't be brave.
He must not question the motives of the defendant.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer obviously compared Waters' response to the critics of judge Kavanaugh, whom criticists accused of acting too angry on the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who candidate to shift Waters at the middle of the mandate elections, also responded through Twitter.
"The big thing if it's true," he tweezed.
In her statement, Waters said that her office warned "suitable competent institutions and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We will make sure the perpetrators find out," she continued, "and before the law they are responsible for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous for all members of my staff."
Film review Johnny English again in action – milk spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become traditional to seek a subtext on Brexit in every new British topic film, which can also apply to this continuation of the satiary action comedies on Johnny English – which started in 2003 by realizing "Johny English" and returned to the screens in 2011 by continuing "Johny English: reborn".
Will the ironical autosat on how uneven we are obviously useless be a new export opportunity for the nation?
Anyway, an asshole, an incompetent Johnny English rubber face has received a new opportunity to screw up something – with his name more than anything he describes that it is a general comic creation designed for a cinema audience whose English is not a native language.
It is, of course, a foolish secret agent who, despite the bizarre claims to the highest glamur, wears little Clouseau, Mr. Bean's trunk and a little bit of that guy who played only one note in the framework of the thematic melody of the "Chariots of Fire" at the ceremony of the opening of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
It was also originally based on a passenger and an international man covered by a secret which Atkinson used to play in now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos behind.
One or two stages of the latest is a good thing.
I liked when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medium-century knight armor and when the rotor knives swift about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and in a very strange way surplus, especially now when "serious" film brands like 007 and the impossible Mission self-confidencely add comic elements.
It's the impression that it's about humour for children, not adults, and for me the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not inventive and developed as Atkinson's gegos in the style of German movies in the image of Mr. Bean.
Now it is a very current theme that Great Britain is in serious problems.
Hacker infiltrated into the British supersecret network of spys, revealing the identity of all British agents in the field, to the horror of the agent at duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop in a full glass of water for a prime minister, a pomped and shocked guy who's already suffering a complete collapse due to the decline of political popularity: Emma Thomson has masterly played this character designed by the example of Theresa May, but the scenario is quite poor.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spys are compromised and they will have to hire one of the retired.
And that means a screwed Johnny English, who is now working as a teacher in some famous institution, but unauthorally keeps lessons about how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gegos when English holds academy for spying in the film "School of the deadline."
They quickly return to Whitehall to emergency instructions and to reconstruct him with the former immensely patient partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to the commander of the submarine, whose energy and noise role Vicki Pepperdine was a little spent.
So Batman and Robin are again on the service of Her Majesty's secret service and fortunately the beautiful fatal wife, Ophelia Bulletová, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls into a carismatic technical billionaire trap who claims he can solve British computer problems: the wicked Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their division of comic events: converted into waitress, burned an elegant French restaurant, making chaos with a cover boarding on Walta's luxury yacht and English running the real anarchy trying to get to know the inside of the Waltina house using the phones for virtual reality.
Apparently, a great effort has been made in that last sequence, but no matter how sweet and joyful, the whole film is like it's made for children.
Pretty medium-quality.
As in other movies about Johnny English, I can't forget: can the British film industry design a role for Rwan Atkinson that would really show his talent?
The Laborist Party denies making a plan for the British to work four days a week and to be paid in five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corby will consider a radical plan on which the British would work four days a week, but they would be paid for five.
The party apparently wants the company's bosses to transfer the time they save to workers thanks to the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) by granting them another day off.
The employees would like to enjoy the three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same salary.
Sources say that the idea would "incorporate" into the economic programme of the party and plans to improve the working conditions and the rights of workers.
The transition to the four-day working week approved the Sindical Congress as a way that workers can use a changing economy.
The high source from the Laburist Party said to Sunday Times: "The new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is an ambition that fits into a party approach to the economic rebalance for workers, as well as a party industrial strategy at all."
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse this idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the pre-electoral campaign in 2017.
However, this ambition does not support the whole Laburist Party.
The Laburist Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party does not consider it."
The Opposition Officer John McDonnell used the Laburist Party conference last week to expose his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined in his intention to take power from the hands of the "free directors" and "professor" in communal companies.
The opposition Chancellor's plans also mean that current stock owners in water supply companies may not recover their entire investment because labourists could impose "prints" on the basis of noticed injustices.
He also confirmed the plans to include employees in the companies' committees and create inclusive ownership funds that would allocate 10% of the value of companies in the private sector to employers who are likely to collect annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy talks about the 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation could change their opinion.
The FBI investigation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and revokes the question whether the bureau investigation could lead some Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
In the interview shown on Sunday, the transmitter of the "60 minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Caroline.
"I think, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before the hearing I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges appeared, I asked, ‘ Did you do it? ’
He was indecisive, decisive, unreasonable."
However, the voice of Senator Graham seems to be betonized.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh was formed and would be necessary a strong accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has denyed it energically," Graham added, talking about Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone who she appoints can't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Festival of the world's citizens and did he do anything that would reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be a city host of the Festival of citizens of the world, an annual music event with a really impressive list of stars that will be performed, and equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Festival of citizens of the world will gather tens of thousands of people on a large lawn of the Central Park that will not only enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of this event, which is to end extreme poverty until 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which was held for the first time in 2012, is a prolonged global project against poverty, an international group in favour of eliminating poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight against the same.
To get a free ticket for the event (except if you are not willing to pay for VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "deeds", such as volunteering, sending e-mail to the world's leader, telephone call and any other meaningful way to increase consciousness of their goal – the end of poverty.
But how successful is the civilian project of the world with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert a real way to convince people to do something, or just another kind of so-calctivism -- when people believe that they did something that would change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeping?
Since 2011, the Citizen's World Initiative claims that they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of their supporters who have been in favour of a series of different goals.
They say these actions have led world leaders to announce promises and political directions worth over $37 billion and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group stated 390 promises and publications from their actions, and at least $10 billion were already assigned or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the power of food, the partnership of investors and realists from Britain who promised "to help children grow in their full potential", promiseing that Rwandi will allocate $35 million to end food in that country, after they received more than 4700 Twitters from the citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make social injustice of disposal become a historic footnote," Ambassador Food Powers, Tracey Ullman, visitors of concerts live in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5000 actions that have invited Britain to improve mothers and children's nutrition, the government announced that it would finance the diet power project, whose interventions will affect the lives of 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the often asked questions on their site, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The citizen of the world answers, "It will be a long and difficult path, and sometimes we will fall and fall down.
However, as all the major movements for civil rights and against the apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are only some of the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in energy exports – the Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington can "if necessary" use its navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, discovered Ryan Zinke, US Interior Secretary, and transferred Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that the Russian engagement in Syria -- namely, there are legitimate government calls -- is an excuse for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they want to sell energy in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just as they are doing in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the officials, there are ways and means to solve this issue.
"United States have this opportunity to ensure that the sea corridors remain open or block them, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Union of Energy Consumers, an unprofit group called himself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's access to relations with Russia and Iran, asserting that it was the same thing.
"Economic option for Iran and Russia consists less of the use and replacement of fuel," he said, saying Russia owns only one asset, and its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements come after the Trump Administration's mission to increase the exports of coated natural gas to Europe, by replaceing Russia with a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To that end, the officials of Trump's administration, including the US President himself, Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" gaswater project North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin become a "protecter" of Moscow.
Moscow emphasized several occasions that the gaswater North Stream 2, whose value is 11 billion dollars and which should double the existing gaswater capacity at 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
Kremlj claims that the reasons for Washington's violent opposition are a clean economic nature project and that it is an example of unloyal competition.
"I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should have the possibility of selecting suppliers," Russian Minister Alexander Novak said after the meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has caused Germany's response that reaffirmed its design for the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the German industry Union (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industry Union (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "treat" the presidential candidacy for 2020, state Senator Masachusetts said
Senator of Masachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "consciously consider" running for the president after the next medium-term elections.
During a meeting at the city's council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidature.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which includes a woman on top," she said, and she transmits the source of The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will consider seriously running for the president."
Warren called on President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city council, saying he "goes this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was called for criticism of Trump and his candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet published on Friday, Warren said "of course we need a FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the results of the poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of the election bodies voted for Warren did not think that it should be running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voters who will "probably" vote in Massachusetts state said that the senator should not be running, according to a survey conducted by the Centre for Political Research of the University of Suffolk/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed that there was greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent of voters supporting potential candidature and 48 per cent against candidacy.
Other sound names from the order of democrats discussed in terms of their potential candidacy in 2020 were former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talked about the PTSP Track Palin at the Donald Trump support meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruitment in September.
He was arrested and accused of family violence after the incident that happened on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after his return, I can link with what happens to other families suffering from the consequences of PTSP and vulnerability that our soldiers are returning," she said to the audience at the summary of support to President Donald Trump in Tulsa, in Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "heat theme" and, speaking about her son and other war veterans, added "they are returning a little different, returning stronger, wondering if there is respect for what their companions soldiers and pilots gave for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and was accused of violence in the family - attack on a woman's person, disturbance of family violence and possession of weapons by opium, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the police administration of Vasilla.
18 countries, D.C. support the dispute of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the review of the new US policy that reduces asylum to the victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and District filed a friendly report to the Court on Friday in Washington in order to support asylum seekers contesting this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against the sessions which the US Union for Civil Freedoms filed in August against the federal police has not been discovered.
She said she was abused by her partner "and the violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace explained how El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, are facing a growing problem of gangs and family violence.
The new policy of the US asylum abolished the decision of the Appeals Committee of Immigrants from 2014 which allowed immigrants to have no documentation and flee from domestic violence, to file a request for asylum.
The State Attorney of the District of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in his statement on Friday that the new policy "is neglecting decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum requirements be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the requirements, and thus the chamber breaks the principle," the friendly report states.
Attorneys further in the report argue that the police that disables the entry to immigrants are harming the US economy, and that they will probably become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, the prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in migrant cases not to asylum to victims who flee from violence in the family and gang violence.
"The asylum is available only to those who leave their homelands for persecution or fear due to the nature of a certain race, religion, nationality or a certain social group or because of their political opinion," the Sessions said in the statement of 11 June speaking of politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to mitigate all problems, even all serious problems that people around the world face daily.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palo while the number of dead is doubled in search of survivors
The survivors' situation is getting worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusum, comforting her sick little boy in the evacuation center in the desolated town of Palo.
"Each minute, the ambulance brings the bodies.
The poor government of pure water."
The inhabitants return to their broken homes, scattering around flooded things trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals destroyed by a earthquake of 7.5 degrees were suffered.
Some of the injured, like Dw Harris, who has broken his back and shoulder, are situated outside the Military Hospital of Palua, where patients are being provided to help outside because of continuous strong rear earthquakes.
His eyes are filled with tears when he was telling him how he felt a strong earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed by the ruins of the wall," Harris said to the Associated Press agency, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of being "violent in propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published an ad on four pages in the U.S. daily newspaper, praising the mutual benefit of the trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread the propaganda.
The US President Donald Trump addressed on Wednesday a payable supplement of Chinese newspapers China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most selling newspapers in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering with the US Congress elections that will take place on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the American elections indicates, as American officials said to the Reuters Agency, a new phase in the escalating campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is usual that foreign governments publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently captured in an escalating trade war where they increase each other's tariffs for imports.
As a contrast, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were focused on exporters in countries like Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party, said in Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador in China and the former long-year Mayor of the state of Iowa, who is the chief exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, "now doubles this violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"With its propaganda, the government of China exploits the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of press, placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register newspaper," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the kiosk that is located here down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any real reflection of the different views that people in China may have on the problemy economic path of China, bearing in mind that Chinese media are under a solid stick of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not mention the newspapers.
Republicans distract women from voting in front of medium-term elections with Kavanaugh debacco, warn analysts
Analysts warned that a large number of most prominent Republicans who defend and stand with the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several charges of alleged sexual attacks, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the forthcoming medium-term elections.
The emotions linked to this issue are very intense and most Republicans already show that they want to give their vote.
There is no return in these matters," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University of Syracuse, in a magazine published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that the fact that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) asked the FBI's investigation in the last minute would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," Karine Jean-Pierre said on Friday, a higher advisor and a state spokesman of the MoveOn Progressive Group, says Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators cried "November coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate Chamber, while the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to endure with Kavanaugh's candidature despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be enormous," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say he's already high, which is true.
But he could be higher, especially among the indecisive women's voters in suburbs and with young voters between 18 and 29 years of age, who although they don't like the president, do not vote."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, in which she presented details of the alleged sexual attack against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, the analysts considered that there could be negative reactions if the Republicans persist in appointment.
"This has become a big mess for the Great Old Party," Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, transmitted the NBC News network.
"It's not only about the vote of the Committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also about the way the Republicans solved the issue and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities Group, which supports the choice of democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about whom to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slight incline on the side of Kavanaugh.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41% of the subjects definitely or probably believe the testimony of Ford, while 35% said that they definitely or probably trust Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30% said that they thought the same thing about Ford.
After the Flake initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the indications made by Ford and at least another person who filed the charge, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunk state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez is allegedly claiming that the candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court showed her genitalities while they attended parties during their studies in Yale in 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor plans to run a new Internet that will overcome Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web network, launchs the launchup aimed at being a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid, whose manufacturer is Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In the exclusive intelligence for Fast Company, Berners-Lee was kidding that the intention of the Intrupte was "world domination".
"We must do it right away," he said, speaking of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store" or "pod" (personal online data store).
It can contain a list of contacts, a list of obligations, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique for a personal data store on the network is that it is entirely dependent on the user who can access any types of information.
The company calls it "personal reinforcement through data."
According to the chief director of the company, John Bruce, the idea is that the Inrupt company provides sources, processes and suitable skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM security platform, a number of employees of developing engineers engaged to work on the project and the community of volunteers developers.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models overnight will be completely destroyed.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a submission from Saturday on the Medium Platform, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupta "is a mission to ensure commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solida."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established a World Wide Web Consortion to the Institute for Technology Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was a very influenced voice in the debate on net neutrality.

"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: The celebration of Victoria's cross assigned to a priest in World War I
The celebration in honor of the only priest of the English Church, who was depicted by Victoria's cross as a fighter in the First World War , was approximately in his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won a recognition on September 29, 1918 for the attack at the towns of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a few days later, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he won the greatest British military recognition.
On a parade held in Rushden on Saturday, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered the memorial panel.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that "incredibly symbolic" was that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after the award for which his grandfather received the prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel "with a very thick fog and under a strong shooting from the battlefield and a gunfire."
Later, he hurried to the fire line, and with the "the greatest heroism" he led the lead forward before he rushed to the Polish gun without help.
Lieutenant Vanna was executed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the war was completed.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s moves were “things I know I could never reach, but also something that causes obedience. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also lay down a vein after the parade led by the drum orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that “he feels honored to participate in the parade ” and added that“ the courage of the true hero shows the support that many will give. ”
MMA fans who stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead get Pep Prass
Imagine that, you've stayed awake all night to watch the swords of Bellator 206, so that you can eventually disable the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main list and appeared live during the night at channel 5 in UK.
At 6:00 a.m., just the moment Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, the watchers in Great Britain were amazed when the transfer broke down the Pep Prass.
Many were not impressed that they stayed awake all night until early morning just because of the fight.
One Twitter fan described this interruption of transmission by a drawn film as “some kind of sick joke. ”
"It's about a government regulation where it says that the content is inappropriate at 6:00 a.m. and they had to replace it with a child programme," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President Bellator for Marking and Communications, on the issue of transfer.
"Peep Prass," yes."
The president of the company, Bellator Scott Coker, said he would work on his schedule to include audience from Britain in the future.
"I think when I'm talking about reprising, I think we can probably solve this," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at six a.m. on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until we have Sunday, when there will be Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when there was an interruption, they circulated the receipts and they were all enemy.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical defect.
But it wasn't, it was about the government's jurisdiction.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we tried to give more to our fans, but we overreacted.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to be successful.
A 24-year-old man said he only realized in high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking at the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs represented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was openly talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that what he became a parent made him less concerned about the Olympic victory.
The regular leader of the long-year programme, Kirsty Young, was absent for a few months because of the disease.
When Daley appeared as a wasteman in the first show of Laverne, he said that during growing up he felt " less valuable" than others because "It was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, those feelings of less value and feeling that I was different were the real things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "one," he said, so people do not be disappointed when they eventually learn about his sexuality.
The double conqueror of bronze olympic medals became a very important fighter for the LGBT population and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he was talking because he was considered happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give the hope to others.
The triple world champion said that falling in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "has surprised him."
Daley married the winner of Oscar last year, who was older than 20 years old, and said that the difference in the years was never a problem.
"When you live so much when you're so young" - the first time he showed up at the Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who experienced similar climbs and falls.
The couple performed the role of the boy's parents Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "a whole perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was only about "I must win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 in the 40th year after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be here to sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held him for a hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I dreamed about all my life - to swim in front of the home audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his choice of the first song - the proud of Heather Small - who responded in it while preparing for the Olympics and from which he was still passing through.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 at British summer time.
Mickelson out of the form on the bench on Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he'll have to regain the form so that this wouldn't be a cheerful turn.
Mickelson, who plays the biennale for the 12th record, Captain Jim Furyk sent on a bench in the Saturday games with four balls and four games.
Instead of being in the center of action, as it was often for the United States, the five-year-old winner spent the day in cheering and improving the range in the game, hoping to correct what disturbs him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the top of his career, is not the ideal choice for a demanding field of Le Golf Nationala, where a long inequality field regularly punishs trapped strokes.
And if I'm not scary enough, Mickelson is facing the British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who won all four of their games this week with the starter Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who 12 individual games start with four points less, come to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he trusted his man, but he couldn't even say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, crushed me on his shoulder and hugged, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He strongly believes in himself.
He's a member of the Famous House and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I imagined there was more, but that's how it went, and we thought it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will overtake Nick Fald's record on the number of Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
That could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, even though Furyk said his presence had brought a certain non-material value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great having such a guy in the team," he explained.
"I think younger players were fun to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a poll of game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, from experience knows that a significant advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be converted into an uncomfortable experience.
Days appeared for the first time at a game played in Valderrama in 1997, when the side whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they finished the competition with a closer difference of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding us that we had a great advantage in Walderrama, we had a great advantage in Brooklin where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won," said Bjorn, deemed after he watched the team in 2018 who won the results of 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 in the Le Golf National field.
So history and everyone in that team will show me this isn't over.
Tomorrow you're going to the end.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win this trophy, and there's a focus on it.
All the time I'm talking, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's on the other side, the biggest players of the world."
Delighted at the performance of his players at a heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added, "I would never let this take me.
Tomorrow's a new day.
Tomorrow's a row of individual games, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're testing the extreme possibilities of yourself as a golf player.
That's the message you have to send to the players - give it the most of you tomorrow.
You're leaving your partner now, and he also has to make the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they played in couples, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Suryk himself was at both ends of those great turns last day, since he was part of the victory team in Brooklyn before he ended as a loser after Europe performed "mad in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he replied when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the start of the same thing as what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When it starts with such a fever, it creates a big pressure on the middle games.
We formed our position according to that, and we prepared the boys so we can try to make a little magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas has been assigned to try to run an attack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jonah Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think she can cover up until the end," Bjorn said about choosing singular players.
A new German warship again waiting
The new German navy fregat was to be released in 2014 to replace older warships from the Cold War, but will not arrive in at least another year due to system disorders and extraordinary costs, local media reported.
The marketing of the “Rheinland-Pfalz” boat in the class of completely new Baden-Wuerttemberg fregates, was delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoted by the army spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems after delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Navy ships from Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen fregate class.
As far as known, they will have a strong gun, a series of anti-air and anti-boat missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as radar, infrared and acustical signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for the latest fregate schedules to be up to two years without returning to maternal ports.
Still, continuous delays mean that the most modern warships, which were to enable Germany to deploy powers outside its territory, will already be old when they start to be used, says Die Zeit.
The unhappy F125 fregat arrived in the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship building in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship builder after delivery.
There are little knowledge of the reasons for returning, but the German media indicated a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" for which the ship, if it was scheduled to a battle mission, would be unused.
Software deficiencies were of particular importance because the ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg will manage the crew of some 120 sailors - exactly half of the numbers of people managed by old Bremen fregats.
Furthermore, it turns out that the ship is significantly too heavy that reduces its impact and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
7,000 tonnes are believed to be a heavy boat Rheinland-Pfalz double weighted than ships of similar classes that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the price of the complete project, including training of staff, also becomes problematic.
It is rumourable that it has reached amazing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared to the starting 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the latest fregates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy actually "was out of ships that can be distributed."
The official said this problem grew up in time because the old ships were cancelled and no substitute ships were purchased.
He complained that none of the fregates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund listens to the secret life of the slipper
A new study conducted on one estate in the hills of Scotland aims to find out how slippers use landscape to seek food.
The results are expected to put a new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future preservation activities.
Study led by scientists from the Scotland National Fund will follow the ordinary swimmings and the kind of soprano Pipistrelle, and the brown long-hole slipper and the Daubenton species in the Gardens of Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
The special recording device will be set on key locations around the property to monitor the mouse activity throughout the season.
Employees and NHS volunteers will also conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
The expert analysis of the recordings of all recordings will determine the frequency of the calls of the slippers and what they do.
Then a map of accommodation and a report will be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a Nature Conservation Adviser in NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas are the most important places to the slippers and how each species use them.
This information will help to strengthen the use of work to manage accommodation, such as the creation of leathers, and which is the best way to maintain forests and other related species.
The population of squirrels in Scotland and the UK has significantly decreased during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which negatively affect the beds and loss of accommodation.
The wind and lighting can also be a risk, including a sticky paper and a chemical processing of construction material, and the attacks of cats.
The slippers aren't really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes in capture of the capture.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, who cares about more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha countries throughout the country, takes very seriously the slippers.
There are ten trained experts who regularly perform checks, inspections of the bed and sometimes rescue.
The organization even established the first and only reservation for squirrels in Scotland on the property of Threave in Dumfries and Gallowey, which are home for eight of the ten types of squirrels in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson says the property is a perfect territory for them.
"There in Threave we have a large area for slippers," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and all good places.
But there's so much more unknown about the slippers, so what we're doing here and on other propertys will help us better understand what they need to make progress."
He emphasizes how important it is to verify whether the slippers are on the property, because it is possible that the accidental destruction of one mother's bed kills up to 400 females and young people, which will likely result in the extinction of the entire local population.
The mushrooms are protected animals and the law prohibits their killing, maltreatment, disturbing or destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scotian Storage Fund, has emphasized the public to engage and help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our sticks, and we simply don't know how most of our species are developing. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has accused him of rape as "fake news," saying that people "will promote" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping a American named Kathryn Mayorga in the hotel room in Las Vegas 2009.
He apparently paid her 37,000 dollars after that to shut up this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Turning to his companions who were 142 million in the video on the Instagram Live network, a few hours after the charges report, Ronaldo, 33, criticised the reports by calling them "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," a five-time conquer of the Golden Ball said in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain glory talking about me, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added smiling.
Ronald's attorneys are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting on the suspicions of privacy", according to Reuters.
The attorney Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "nematerial damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the past years".
Apparently, the incident occurred in June 2009 at the hotel Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents delivered to the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knees on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a "99% good boy" whom he cheated on those "1%."
The papers state that Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sexual relations, but that he was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and was worried that "will be humiliated publicly."
34-year-old girl says she is now looking for annulment of the settlement because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the edge to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time that allegedly occurred the attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve for 100m euros.
Brexit: The UK will regret for losing car manufacturers forever
The UK will regret "forever" if he loses the status of the world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that what Toyota UK said about BBC -- if Britain left the EU without an agreement that it would temporarily stop production in its plant in Burnastone, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delay on borders in case Bexit remains without agreement could cause loss of jobs.
The Burnastone Toyotin Auris and Avensis factory produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain leaves the EU late March, we will see the stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director-General of Toyote in Burnastone.
Other UK producers, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rovera, expressed fear of how cross-border trade will work if Britain leaves the EU without agreement.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call risks in the procurement chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyote manufacturing line functions on the principle "right in time", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from the UK and EU suppliers for cars made by orders.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a breakdown at the border, which can lead to delays and shortcomings of parts according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies longer than one day in his factory in Derbyshire, they said from the company, so the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers plan offering Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to have an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow as I say, not only to enjoy the current success but also to grab this opportunity," Radio 4 said in today's BBC programme.
"The example not only of Toyote but also of other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely capable of pursuing what was extremely successful in the supply chain."
Toyota couldn't tell how long the production would be suspended, but she warned that long-term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and eventually reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnastone for 24 years and was the president of the union union in the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, when such jobs are closed, they never return.
The Government spokesman said: "We must make a precise and persuasive plan of our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, they say from the White House
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "was deferred for another week" because the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, they said from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of a special advisor Robert Mueller, investigating the case of Russian involvement in elections, links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and potential distractions of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will dismiss the Deputy General Prosecutor or not, and it would endanger Mr. Mueller's independence for months of speech in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein also discussed the sounding to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of shifting the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein dropped these rumors.
But last Monday he was in the White House, in the middle of the rumors that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he wouldn't "will" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was deferred to avoid a breakdown with the hearing of the Cavanaugh Justice Commission of the Senate, at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Cavanaugh's charges for a week, which further delayed the Senate's vote in full composition.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on the Fox News Channel on Sunday.
On the question of a meeting with Rosenstein, she answered: “The date for this is not yet established, that could be this week, and it could be delayed for another week, taking into account all the other things that are going on about the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like the press always to be informed."
Some journalists would resist this claim: Sandersova has not held a short talk for journalists in the White House since September 10th.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the smaller number of short talks is not the result of the oppression of the "theater behaviour" of the TV journalists, even though she said, "I will agree with the fact that they are exaggerating."
Then she said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be strengthened.
"The President holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said without any indication of evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
Short talks will continue to be maintained, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the question directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it as much and you've seen us doing it for the past few weeks, and those talks with the President of the United States will replace brief talks to the press."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences in visits of officials.
The single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, behaving in front of the gathered journalists, unsafe and occasionally strange.
Health Secretary writes to EU employees in the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on fears related to Brexit
The health secretary wrote to EU employees who work in the Scotland NHS to express the State's gratitude and the desire to remain after Brexit.
Member of Scotland's Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the United Nations retreat from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed to reconciliating the costs of resolved demands for EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued during the summer, and decisions are expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also expedited its preparations for a possible script without agreement.
I know this was a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to repeat my appreciation for the contribution of every staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all EU, and broader, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which benefits from patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie subjected to an emergency operation after head injury
The defense team of State Tigers Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he hurt his head on Saturday defeat 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores club, reports Mike Organ from Tennesseean.
The Chief Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told the press that the injury happened a little before half-time.
"He came to the field line and just crashed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the ground before they put it on the weapons and took it to further examination.
The Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from the WSMV Nashville channel, Tennessee, that Abercrombie ended the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/about injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, second year's student in red dress, plays the first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
He had five total bullets on Saturday before he left the game, reaching a total of 18 bullets in the season.
Foreign customers will charge higher fees for buying real estate in the UK
Buyers from foreign countries will charge higher taxes in buying real estate in the UK, using additional funds to help homeless according to new conservative plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Greater taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The vault expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year - for helping homeless
Foreign customers will charge larger taxes in buying real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless, Theresa May will be published today.
This step will be considered as an attempt to neutralize the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn, trying to attract young voters to promise that they will provide more accessible housing and focus on those who earn more.
The higher taxes will be charged to individuals and companies not paying taxes in the UK, with additional money strengthening the Government's intention to fight sleeping openly.
Additional compensation, which is next to existing taxes, including more levels, introduced two years ago to another property and purchase for rent, could be even 3%.
The safe expects this move to increase income to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built real estate in London buy people who have no residence in the UK, making prices grow, and the buyers who first buy real estate become more difficult to become householders.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of a large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
New policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in taxi to help a larger number of young people reach their first home.
He accused construction companies to hold high prices of real estate by buying lands that they do not use at first, and asked Ms. May to give up the quotas for access houses as soon as possible to stop the British "happiness of the housing policy".
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rental control and suspension of no derogations caused.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new houses.
Ms. May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my prime minister’s mandate to restore the British dream - that life of every new generation should be better.
And that means repairing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign companies can buy houses easily as worthy British.
The dream of ownership over the house has become too far for many people, and the unman’s sleep on the open and still real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland."
The chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says he's his "final ambition" to be the manager of the Scottish team at a certain point.
Forty-two-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge to return to the life of the Northeast club, currently located in the third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after St. Mirren returned to the Scottish Prime Minister's League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was in B-tim and that was it," Ross told the Sportsound BBC Scotland show.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and that always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be provided if I was successful in the management of the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sanderland managers include Dick Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former head of the Alloa Athletic club says he didn't feel anxiety because he came after such big names in such a big club, after he refused offers of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of my success at this point will be in it 'Do I manage to bring this club back to the Prime Minister' League?'
Judging by the structure and possibilities of this club, he is undoubtedly belonging to the Prime Minister League," he said.
"It's not a easy task to bring him there, but I think I can only consider myself successful if I can get the club back where he belongs."
Ross is only in the third year of his managerial career, after the period he spent as a assistant boss in Dumbarton and 15 months spent as part of Harts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from falling into the third category, and St. Miren pulled off the edge of falling into the lower league to the Championship winners of the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real crossroad," he recalled the download of the Allo Club.
"I honestly believed that the management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I wasn't bad, I was decently eager, and I enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and job pressure, but the management just fits me.
I've always wanted to take care of it, and now I'm doing it, I've never felt more comfortable in my adult life than now."
The whole interview you can listen to in the Sportsaund show on Sunday 30 September at the Scottish Radio from 12.00 to 13.00 by British summer weather
Perfect time for the cup is Saturday at 17:30, revealing research
The summer wave of heat increased the transport of British pubs fighting for survival, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In the group of pubs and bars, sales increases of 2.7% in July, but the traffic in restaurants fell by 4.8%, as the figures indicate.
Peter Martin, a CGA consultant, who collected data, said: “The lasting suntime and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Championship contributed to the following similar patterns of July as the previous month of June, when the pubs achieved a 2.8% growth, and the restaurants had even greater decline.
Traffic decline in restaurants of 1.8% in June just deteriorated in July.
The pubs and bars focused on drinks have achieved the best result with greater growth compared to comparable results from the previous period than the drop of traffic in restaurants.
The pubs focused on food also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatic as the owners of the restaurant.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, drink sales were increased by 6.6% per month, with a decrease in food sales by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the Agency for Analysis of Fun Content and Hospital of RSM, said: “This results continue the trend we testify from the end of April.
The weather opportunities and the impact of major social and sports events remain main factors when it comes to sale on the market outside the household.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight hard, although 4.8% of sales falling at the annual level will be particularly painful with already present price pressures.
The long hot summer could not come in a worse time for the guests focused on food, and the time will show whether the moderate temperatures we had in August would provide a little more than the necessary relief."
The overall growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slower introduction of new brands.

Every fifth child has a secret warrant on social networks hiding from his parents
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret warrant on social networks hiding from their parents and teachers, reveals research
A study covering more than 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages
This news has increased fear of the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said he had a "main" warrant showing to his parents
Every fifth child, some of whom are only 11 years old, makes orders on social networks that he hides from adults.
A study covering 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in “fake Insta” warrants, referring to the Instagram photo sharing page.
Those news have increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said he had a pure "main" warrant showing to his parents, but they also have private warrants.
One mother who met the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager calling others to say "force me."
The study carried out by the UK Digital Awareness and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of independent schools revealed that 40% of children 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles, while half of them admitted that they had private commissions.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: It's a disturbing fact that so many teenagers come in temptation to create space on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be an athletic voice in the Scotland Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scotland Athletic Committee as an inexecutive director at the annual congregation of that administrative body.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athletic, and chairman Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who have sports to benefit from her rich experience gained at the international level during the past decade
"Eilid enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the sports in Scotland will have great benefits from its membership in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be a voice of sportsman, and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland. ”
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including the winnings of 200 and 400 meters in the games in Atlanta in 1996, and now is a regular expert on the BBC, remained immediate after he experienced a transitory ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “I suffered a brain attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time can show if I'm going to recover and how much.
It was a hard job, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again, and I'm doing agility practice today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for a traitor in which mothers compare with cows shared opinions on the Internet
The company that produces traitors shared opinions on the Internet by an advertising that compares breast cows with muzars.
In order to mark the launching of the product described as “first silent traitor”, Elvie’s consumer technology company published an advertising inspired by entertaining music video showing the freedom the new pump provides to mothers who publish milk.
Four real mothers dance in the barn between the seed and the cows with a song, which says: "Yes, I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but it's not my breasts."
Follows the refren: "Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, pump myself."
However, the advertising published on the Facebook website of the company has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video caused various reactions of the viewers, while many said that it was throwing light on "the horribles" of the milk industry.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
And they must be pregnant and born like us to produce milk, but their babies are taken away for a few days after their birth," someone wrote.
Elvie's extradition pump is discreetly fitted into the breast bracelet (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't they use them to advertise a traitor for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: “He said no sense. ”
Others stood in defense of the advertisement, and one woman admitted her song was "unserious".
"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy this to still breast.
I felt like a cow because of my betrayal.
The advertisement is a little foolish, but I figured it out right.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “This is a ridiculous advertisement focused on mothers who betray milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like “cows. ”
This isn't a commercial that praises the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they were dancing all with discreet pumps hidden in their chests.
The concept of the advertisement is based on knowing that many mothers who betray milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely insensitive, there is no wire or pipe and stands in the breast breast, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even exit while they betray milk.
Anne Balarin, a partner and an executive creative director in Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves courage and provocative launch.
By pulling the parallel between breasts and the cows of the muzars, we wanted to focus on the issue of milk and all the challenges that go along with it, showing a fun and understandable way of incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump got into the newspaper titles.
During the Week of Mode in London, the mother of two children appeared on a track in the creation of Marta Jacobska using this product.
Thousands of children migrants secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part, because the acute rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made the finding of childcare guardians difficult.
Traditionally, most custodians and themselves were migrants without documents fearing to endanger their residue in the country by steping forward to accepting the child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential custodians and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Service, said in front of the Congress last week that this service arrested dozens of people who signed up for custody over minors without escort.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the previous arrested were not convicted.
"Nearly 80% of those who are either guardians or household members of the custody are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are strangers who have committed crimes.
So we'll continue searching for those people, Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to get children through the procedure faster, officials have introduced new rules under which some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, the recruitment workers say.
Many will call in a video call instead of personally, so that the immigration judge will request the illegality of their status.
Those who are determined not to meet the conditions will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain closed, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to anger or escape attempts, the recruitment workers and reports that have arrived from the system in the past months are emphasized.
Attorneys say that such risks are increased in larger institutions like the city of Tornillo, where it is much easier to overlook signs that indicate that the child has problems.
They added that moving children into a tent city without enough time to be emotionally prepared or to say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma with which many children are already fighting.
Syria asks for urgent withdrawal of American, French and Turkish occupational forces
In addressing the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also called on Syrian refugees to return, although the war in that country has lasted eight years.
Moulem, who is also in the position of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally in the Syrian country, under an excuse for the fight against terrorism and "will be counted in the right way."
They must immediately and without conditional withdraw," he said at the session.
Moulem insisted that in Syria, “the war against terrorism has almost been completed” where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "holy fight until we destroy all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, primarily in charge of training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in the field in this country destroyed by war.
With regard to refugees, Moulem said there were good conditions for their return and blamed "independence of Western countries" to "distribute irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We invited the international community and the humanitarian organizations to enable these returns," he said.
"They politicize what should be a pure humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help renew Syria until Assad and the opposition reached a war ending agreement.
The UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon-zone in the last major rebel rebellion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey treaty disagreed with the great attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia in a province in which three million people live.
Moulem, however, emphasized that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action against dżihadists and fighters from the front of Nusra associated with Al Kaida would be "exterminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon he will convene the first meetings of the new committee consisting of the authorities and opposition members to make a draft post-constitution for Syria and prepare a road to the elections.
Moulem stated the conditions of the Government of Syria for participation in the Committee's work, saying that the work of the body should be limited to "constitutional considerations" and warned of the possibility of external involvement.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
According to that logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 elections unless many liberal viewers probably hope for revocation and scandal to terminate his mandate earlier.
That would undoubtedly be the "the dramatic end of the presidential mandate of all times!"
So far, there's no sign of audience's tiredness.
Since 2014, the struggle rate has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN channel and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC channel.
According to Nelsen, the Fox News channel has a average of 2.4 million audiences in a stroke term, unlike four years ago when they were 1.7 million, and Rachel Maddow Show channel MSNBC has overcome the rating of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the night with hit news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer producer of the drama "Elected survivors" on the ABC channel, the government secretary who becomes president after the attack destroying Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a long-year writer of comedies and author of the book “Only funny parts: and a few cruel truths about putting in the Hollywood Club,” has a different theory.
She remembers the taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her she'd vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, "because he makes me laugh," Ms. Scovell told me.
The chaos also has a fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories that come from Washington can decide the future of the Roa abortion law against Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to connect and what the global economy will be.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you went a little far away from general information when you realized that you were watching a panel of experts six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of the "deep background" for his book "Strah," about Paul Manafort's jacket of the skin worth $15,000 (the clothing with a thick fashion," wrote Washington Post) and the implications of the picturesque descriptions, this, anatomy, Mr. Trump, which Mr. Stormy Daniels gives.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mary with the same eyes again.
"The part of what he makes you experience it as a reality show is that you have something to feed every evening," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the developer of the "Player" show, commenting on the rotation of the activist position and the daily confusion of Trump's show (critification of the American football league, commendation Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you're in restraint.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the north coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunned with approximately 80 degrees (27 °C), but he closed himself inside and watched MSNBC and filmed CNN at the same time.
He couldn't separate himself from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Justice Commission, and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large inflows of money by side in the most uncertain medium-term election race for the Representation Home
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania experiences a flood of money, thanks to the re-deployment of the Congress Countries, resulting from two candidates in the race for the same place.
Recently the cross-border borders in the Pittsburgh suburb led to the elections of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who was headed by the second district after an emergency election last spring.
Lamb fights against another current representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th Pennsylvania district, which is largely complied with the new 17th district.
Tickets have been reprinted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally formed for the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a fight for the funding of the campaign between the main parties' funding collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the democratic campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in widely seen special elections for the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania in March.
That position was held by the Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point district.
Political analysts have given little advantage to democrats.
The United States is considering the punishment of El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreat
Diplomatics have concluded that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a few incentives from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Paname Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Steering Team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of the diplomatic missions from EL Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "new decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, speaker of the Department, in the beginning of the month.
But the penalties were considered only for El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million of US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would have been difficult to hit this Central American country with high unemployment and murders.
As the internal meetings progressed, North America and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was to continue the similar last year's meeting which represented a step forward in efforts to prevent the influx of migrants in the United States.
By mid-September, however, the high administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to be held and actually ceased any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the administration administers the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
Chairman of the White House on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions provided that they remain anonymous.
Their testimony were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next thing that is preparing could be the report of special investigator Robert Mueller on the possible Trump obstruction of justice, which is now significant evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller also focused his investigation on finding a possible link between Trump's campaign and Russia's assault on elections.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he's preparing to regain before the voters and perhaps in front of the jury.
There's a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall, nor those in Europe that are like him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, the German soldiers were willing to strike the state against Hitler, just that the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia in München.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter.
The course of history turns around such breakpoints, and the unpleasant democracy march is accelerating or slowing.
The Americans are facing several such breakpoints now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an independent position since this paper reported last year that he proposed a secret recording of the president and made speculation that it was not similar to the function.
Mr. Rosenstein says the deposition from the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recently ordered FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite convincing charges of sexual attack and false testimony?
And above all, shall we vote for the Congress at the medium-term elections that will call Mr. Trump on responsibility?
If we fall on these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we won't fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country in which I am an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to burn candles for Sabbath on that table with a cucumberous cross.
With such heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
On Thursday, the Rapid host of Vienna, knowing that the victory of the Austrians, after the impressive remiss in Spain against Villarrel at the beginning of this month, will put them in a good position to qualify from a group of G European Leagues.
The knee injury prevented the connected player Graham Dorrans from debiting these seasons until the unsolved match with Vilareal of 2-2 final results, but he is convinced that the Rangers can use that result as a board for further.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," a 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game by believeing that we can achieve something and we left with the point.
Maybe we could've taken them to the end, but in all, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came back in the second and we were better.
On Thursday, we are again waiting for a great European evening.
We hope we can take three points, but it'll be a hard match because they had a good result in the last game, though, with the support of the audience, we can definitely push out and achieve a positive result.
Last year, it was definitely difficult, starting with everything that happened to my injuries and to change in the club itself, but now we are pleased with what we have right now.
The team is in good shape, and the boys really enjoy; we're training well.
I hope we can continue now, leave the past season behind us and be successful."
Women can't sleep from anxiety because of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the questionnaires had a clear idea of how they would like to take care of them, few of them discussed this with their family members.
About half of the people covered by Nationwide's research said they were discussing long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10% of them said they were talking about it with their children.
"People want someone in the family to take care of them, but they don't want to talk about this topic," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the life insurance sector in Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your desires in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family and consider where and how to give it to you, because such decisions can be a significant factor in the determination of the price.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you and figure out how to pay those costs.
Your choices to finance long-term care can include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that would help you cover these costs or self-sustainment by your own savings - provided you have enough money.
Fix your legal documents: Prevent legal battles in the root.
Make an authorization to make decisions on medical assistance so that you can have an authorised trusted person to supervise the medical care provided and ensure that health workers treat in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the completion of the financial power contract.
This means that you choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of paying your accounts if you remain powerless.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your older parents find themselves in a situation where he needs an ambulance and take him to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Specify the details in the written plan to be prepared.
"It's not only about finances, it's also about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."

The cops described the shooting, which happened about 2:30 to the British summer time, as a random act.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not dangerous for life, and the police have invited witnesses to answer.
Earthquakes and cunamies in Indonesia
At least 384 people killed a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials reported, and the number of dead is expected to grow.
As there were interruptions, aid officers could not get any information from the Dongale Province, areas northern from Palua, closer to the epicentre of the quakes of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Paluo after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donghala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the west coast of Sulawesia, with a estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit him.
Donggala is a district that stretches over 300 miles (180 miles) the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The district, which was administratively lower than the province, had a estimated population of 299.200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis of the province's economy of Central Sulawes, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nicle mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Moralia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by cunamie several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, he killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Cunami also hit the west Donggala in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in the past years:
2004: The large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province Aceh in North Sumatra on December 26th caused tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The quake of 6,8 degrees hit the south of Java, the most inhabited Indonesian island, launching tsunamis that plugged in the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of 7.6 degrees hit the town of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of 7,5 degrees hit one of the Mentawai island near Sumatra, which caused tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A tiny earthquake affected the region of Pidi Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because he reminded people of the death of earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
This time there was no cunamie, but more than 100 people died in a ruin of buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes have been hit by the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people lost their lives, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporaryly captured.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for family violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for an assault charge.
Palin, 29, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of committing domestic violence, interfering with reporting on domestic violence and resisting arrest, the report published by the State Police Agency of Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was held in Math-Su's detention unit, and he was given a $500 parole bail, CTUU reported.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, where he stated "no guilty of guilt," the network said.
Palin is faced with three breaches of class A, which means he's threatened with a prison sentence for a year and a penalty of $250,000.
He was also accused of a breach of class B, punishing a prison penalty for one day and a $2,000 penalty.
This is not the first time against Palin's criminal claims were filed.
In December 2017, he was charged with an attack on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the court of the veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disturbance of family violence and possession of weapons associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin criticised the veterans in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behaviour with PTSP after his service in Iraq.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a earthquake hit by the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused by tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
There have been a breakdown of connections and electricity supply, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the next days.
The eccentre of the earthquake was directly next to the central part of Sulawesia, north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Societal networks are circling videos that show the moment of a hit.
hundreds of people gathered together at the beach festival in Palo City when the tsunami scattered the coast.
Federal Prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died -- a rare penalty that has not been executed for federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, apparently used the rental truck of the company Home Depot to carry out attacks on the bicycle road along the West Side road in Dolni Manhattan, with the wagon and bicycles that were found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally ” killed eight victims and“ deliberately ” caused severe physical injuries, the request for a death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
For both of these points, the death penalty is possible, as stated in the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal major jury accused Saipov on 22 points of charge, which included eight charges for murder and racket, which the federal prosecutors usually use in the cases of organised crime, and the charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and prediction," the prosecutors said, describeing the way Saipov conducted it as "a gross, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to families and friends of Diega Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diega Mendoze and Alejandra Damian Pagnucca," said in the request for a sentence.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since South York district last had a case in which a death penalty was threatened.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but eventually sentenced to life prison in September 2009.
The latest death penalty in a federal case in New York was executed in 1953 over Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after being convicted to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 1953.
According to the judicial documents, Saipov, born from Uzbekistan, has not shown regret in days and months after the attack.
He said to investigators that he was feeling good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that, after watching the video of ISIS on his phone, he was inspired to commit an attack, the accusation said.
He also asked to highlight the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, the police said.
He said he wasn't guilty at 22 points of charge.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders representing Saipov, said they are apparently disappointed by the decision of the plaintiff.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, instead of accepting a lifetime prison without the possibility of exemption for guilt recognition will only extend the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Sayip's defense has previously asked the plaintiff not to expose the death penalty.
Conservative Ambassador says NIGEL FRAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the People's Army" during the protests at the Conservative Conference.
Former head of the UK Independence Party said that politicians had to "feel dissatisfaction" by the Eurosceptic, since one of the Members of Therese May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone said at the Birmingham mith that the UK would have "exited" so far that Mr. Farage was a secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faced in trying to unify her deeply divided lines emphasized conservatives who promoting EU residence and joining a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister strives to maintain its compromise plan from Chequers despite attacks and supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
Allies insist that it continues to try to make agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forces euro skeptics and labourists to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone said to go to Solihull to "drop Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should receive the title and be responsible for negotiations with Bruxelles.
"If he had been in charge, we'd have been out by now," he said.
The messenger from Wellingborough added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers. ”
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subjected.
We want to bring our laws into our country."
Mr. Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain completely incorrect."
Brexita Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the meeting, told the journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the wider public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually and were those who went to the streets and chose us.
"Please dismiss the plan from Chequers and start listening."
In a sharp message to Ms. May, she added: “Premiers are able to keep their jobs when they keep their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said to the gathered politicians must be forced to "feel dissatisfaction" if they are about to fail the decision made at the referendum in 2016.
"It is now about trust between us - the people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to order them "that won't pass."
In the message of an excited audience, he added: “I want our political class, on the edge of the Brexita edition, to feel displeased.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that brought us a victory in Brexit and we will not calm down until we become an independent, self-regulated, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, residues marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
Several activists waved the transparency "Torievci versus Brexit" after forming a group this weekend.
The Labourist Lord Adonis laughed at conservatives for security problems they had with the party's application to open the conference.
"They are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the Canadian Plus plan, for the unrestrained state on borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
Good Brexit is not possible," he added.

Russian Gran Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after the order guarantees his victory over Sebastian Vettel.
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the order of teams would play a great role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Wettel went first to box and left Hamilton behind to get involved in a traffic at the beginning, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered a circle later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action wheel from the wheels that caused Ferrari's driver to leave free inside with a risk of delay after a double move in the defense of the third band.
Max Verstappen started from the last line of retirement and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race relying on his tires to reach the rapid ending and overrun Kimie Raikkonen in the fourth place.
He finally arrived in boxing in the 44th circle, but failed to accelerate the rate in the remaining eight circles while Raikkonen took the fourth place.
The day was hard because Walteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was a gentleman who let me go.
The team has done a really extraordinary job to achieve one or two formation finals," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body speech.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinsten on the Summit on Saturday for her insistence that she did not let Christine Blasey Ford publicly in which the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking at the west Virginia tribute, the president did not directly testify to Ford in front of the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are wicked, poor and liar.
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that's been happening in the Senate in the last few days, when you see anger, when you see people angry and wicked and pathetic and lying, he said.
When you look at the press and the information that leaked out, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you released the information public?
You remember her answer... did you let the document in public... whatever?
Oh, no.
I didn't let it go."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford Feinstein sent a letter in July with details on Ford's instructions against Kavanaugh, and it leaked at the beginning of September -- yet Feinsten demanted that the information was leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't let her story public," she said to the Feinstein committee, reports Hill.
She asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret, as she asked."
But her denial did not encounter the approval of the president, who at the meeting on Saturday night commented: Let me tell you, it was really a bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a bad body speech in my life."
Continuing his defense of a candidate for the Supreme Court, whom three women were accused of sexual abuse, the president insisted that the democrats were used for their own purposes.
They are determined to restore the government at any price.
You see evil, devil, they don't care who they're going to hurt, whom they have to cross in order to reach authority and control," Mediaite transmits the president's words.

The airline whose aircraft crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia states that one person was run missing, after he earlier announced that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the drowning plane.
Air Niugini states in the statement that since Saturday afternoon they are unable to track the passenger.
The airline states that in collaboration with local authorities, hospitals and investigators are working on finding this man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped save other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into water trying to land at the island airport Chuuk.
The officials announced Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline announced that on Saturday, six more passengers were held in the hospital and that everyone was stable.
It was still unexplained what caused the fall and how accurate the sequence of events was.
And the airline and the American Navy announced that the plane ended up in the lagoon without reaching the highway.
Some witnesses think the plane flew over the road.
American traveller Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the rest of them were able to break up to the exit in the case of danger through the water that slipped them to the streak in the drowning plane.
He said the crew was in panic and they were yelling, and he suffered a head injury.
The American Navy stated that the navy who worked near the dock repair also helped to rescue a boat to surveillance which transported passengers to the coast before the plane drowned at a depth of about 30 feet (100 feet).

The US Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
Before the jury, he said he used the cell phone data to close the picture of the movement of the defendant Quinton Tellis, 29 years old, and the victims of Jessica Chambers, aged 19, at the night of her death.
Rowlett said that the location data received with a few phones that show that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which was contrary to his earlier claims, transmitted by the Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was with a friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford, testifying on Saturday, said he wasn't in town that day.
On the question of the plaintiff whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfrod said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistentity was that Tellis found that Chambers met about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett is that Tellis had a certain time after Chambers' death from his phone erased her messages, calls and contact information.
He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense should start with the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury trial to follow later during the day.

Another black person?
The New York nanny's suing a couple for dismissal after a racist message.
The New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal on a discriminatory basis after a mistake received a message from a mother complaining that she is another black person."
A couple denies that they are racists, assessing the lawsuit as extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed displeasure when at her arrival of the first working day of 2016, she realized that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
NEE ANYTHING BACK," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Ms. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her gaff, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, arguing that their former nanny, who was an African woman, was badly doing her job and she expected a Philippine instead, transmitted by New York Post.
Ms. Maurice received a compensation for a day of work and sent home.
Maurice is now suing a couple asking for a dismissal, as well as a $350 per day in six months, to how originally she was hired to live with her family, although without contracts.
I want to show them, see, you can't do such things," she said to the Post on Friday, adding I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to racism charges that the cancellation of Maurice's engagement was reasonable because they were afraid that after she was insulted, they would not be able to trust her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," Post husband Joel Plasco said.
But would you trust your children to someone whom you offended, even though it was made by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."

You're going to chase someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.

The publishers of Paddington feared that the readers would not be identical with the bear who speaks, the new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter: It's hard to put someone who read it for the first time before the publication.
It's very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who, before a little pussy bear inspired him to write a book for children, would work for BBC as a cameraman, still be positive if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was filled with both happiness and sadness after his death last year.
She also added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was a quiet man, he didn't like to praise," she said.
But since Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like a child to achieve something and you're proud of him, though it's not really your credit.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in a way like that.
Although he was the fruit of his imagination , he always had all his credits to Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was urgently transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 in Nica, where the doctors fought for nothing to save her life.
He regularly called to say it was bad, and they didn't expect to survive," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called me to say she's gonna die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
I did it, too.
I said, Tashi, I love you, sweetheart.
And I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep the heart pumping the blood slowly stopped acting and did not run through her blood.
She died just a few moments before that, and everything turned off.
I could just sit and wait, knowing what's next.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be gathered."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was sad about her daughter's death, boarded the plane with the other passengers who didn't even dream about what torment she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I knocked my head down, and my tears went down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I was overwhelmed by compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Unfortunate women leave messages to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women whose loved suicide wanted to stop others from taking their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes on the Welsh bridge set cards with motivation messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression to commit suicide when he was 18 years old.
I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, living in Lydney, said her son was a perspective cook with an infectious laugh.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light every room."
However, before he died, he left his job because he was in a very dark stage."
Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at that time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that it will leave the consequences."
Mrs. Davis has designed these cards so that people know there is someone you can contact and you can talk to, even if it was just a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - talk."
Mrs. Humpreys, a long-year friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he was immoral, depressed or anything else," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
On Christmas, he was on the very bottom-- when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes or anything else."
She says that his death was a huge trauma for them, but that they must overcome it: it leaves a huge void in the family.
That's what gets us apart.
But we will continue and fight."

With the opening of the FBI investigation, the future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain.
I thought that if we really succeeded in getting something from what he asked -- a limited duration investigation and a circumstance -- maybe it would have united us somehow," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears the committee to fall apart" because of unconditional parties' attitudes.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their unwillingness is caused by the choice of a moment.
Congress elections are held only for five weeks, November 6th, and if the Republicans go badly, it is expected that their attempts to be chosen into the country's highest court will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators on Saturday, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the feds make their report?
It will be voted in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 democrats currently are sitting.
It's still inconclusive whether Mr. Kanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to decide and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of escapes from North Korea falls under Kim.
The number of escapes from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korean legislator said.
Calling on the data of the United Nations Ministry of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug states that 1127 escapes were recorded last year compared to 2011 when this number was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two decisive factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and the bigger tariffs that traffickers people charge.
Pyongyang didn't go public.
The large majority of the northern escaped will eventually be offered by South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the 1953 Korean war.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross it than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean.
China of escape considers illegal migrants, not refugees, and often brings them back.
Relations between North and South - which are technically still in war - have improved in the past months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss stopped denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, which has reached a wider consent that they will work on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it does not take into account that we are the first one-sided disarmament," RI said in its address at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical," saying he was unlikely to serve in the Supreme Court.
The Leader of the Minority in the National House, Nancy Pelosi, called a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh hysterical," and said he was unlikely to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't have thought that if a woman ever acted like a hysterical," Pelosi said for her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denyed allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they both were teenagers.
During his introduction exhibition, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and screaming when he talked about his family and his high school age,
He also explicitly condemned democrats in the committee, assessing allegations against him by a grotesk and orchestrated attack on his personality" organised by liberals to be angry that Hilary Clinton lost presidential elections 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not function in the Supreme Court, since it showed his prejudice to the damage of the democrats.
I believe he disqualifys himself with such statements and the way he went against the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
On the question of whether he will try to undo Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if democrats get the majority in the Deputy House, Pelosi has retreated.
I will say the following - if he does not tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not just like being in the Supreme Court, but not only in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Appeal of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the eventual Kavanaugh's verdict against the Law of Accessible Health or in the case of Roe v. Wade, since it is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It's not a time to put a hysterical, extraordinary person in court and to expect us to say if it's not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
A justifiable anger, anger that was gathered for months and years, and it cannot be resolved without weeping.
We cry when we are angry," Mrs Steinem said to me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: a woman who was somewhere the executive director, and she said she was crying when she was mad, but she developed a technique that dramatized that when she got angry and started crying, the person she would talk to says you might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she would just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
The tears are a permitted way to eject anger in part and because they are basically misconcepted.
One of my most clear memories from the previous work, in the office where most men were, is how when I once cried for an unrecognizable anger, one older woman -- a cold boss I was always a little afraid -- grabbed my neck and pulled me out on the stairs.
I never let them see me cry," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado at that time, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidature.
When in 1987 Hart was caught in an outdoor affair on Moneky Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she discovered that there was no reason to consider the idea of running herself for the president.
That was not a very well-reasoned decision," she said through the laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it Snowman and seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign has already been departed, it has been delayed with the collection of funds, so she pledged that she would not enter the race unless she collected two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave to men $1,000 would only give her $250.
Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so obsessed with emotions - thanks to people who supported her, frustration over the system that made her difficult to gather funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger for the shovinism - from which she had achieved her throat.
You'd think I've had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled that the press responded to it.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what would put on my monument?
"She cried?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first cannadas of trade war between the United States and China have been deaf, and while the end of the battle is not yet attending, the distinction between countries can be useful for Beijing, claimed experts.
Donald Trump, US President, fired the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest strike occurred this week with new tariffs that hit the items worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), which are practically taxed by half of all the goods coming from China in the United States.
Beijing returned with the same measure every time, and the latest is the introduction of a tariff of five to ten percent to the US stock of $60 billion.
China pledged that the United States would answer the same measure, and the second by the size of the world's economy seems not to stop soon.
Force Washington to withdraw means meeting the requirements, but public worship to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its next move, US pressures in trade war can long-termly support China by reducing mutual dependency of two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for starting a strict economic fall in one of these two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigali Grace, a researcher focused on Asia at the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is ready" to return refugees, said the Foreign Minister.
Syria says she is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in renewal of the country destroyed by a war that lasts over seven years.
In addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said the conditions in the country are improving.
Today the situation in the field is much stable and safer, thanks to progress made in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal life.
Now there are all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures focused on their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would be welcome to help rebuild the ruined country.
However, he emphasized that he would not accept the conditional aid or aid from countries that helped the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 defeating the US team with the final result of 16,5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National van Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe restored the crown while the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn won 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was tortured during the whole tournament, shocked the ball into the water on the 16th hole of a couple of three, leaving Francescu Molinario's match.
Italian golfer Molinari brightened in all rounds, and became one of the four players who had ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament started in this format in 1997.
The American Jordan Speith lost with 5-4 of Throbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest European team player.
The best ranking player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 of Ian Poulter from England who might have been the last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder purchases, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the best European winner of the tournaments of all times with 25.5 points in his career.
I usually don't cry, but today I couldn't hold up.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy. I'm so happy that we've won the coupon again.
Here's an important team and I'm glad I could be helpful," the emotional Garcia said after the European victory.
He hands over to his countryman John Ram, who beats the legendary American golf player Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in individual matches on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all the four matches in France and now he's holding a record of his career from 13-21-3 on Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 largest titles and is behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team was trying to find the way to the hole all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a top golf during the whole tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, US Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning was the moment we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our board of Ryder Cups, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud I was their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're overwhelmed."
