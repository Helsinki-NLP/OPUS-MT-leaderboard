The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned about being “communicated with the Maps ”
Some CHA are frightened by the recommendation to change the name of their position at the “Member of Parliament of Wales” (MWP).
This recommendation appeared because of the plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Parlament Wales".
The whole political spectrum is concerned that this can cause ridicules.
One HA from the layborists stated that his group was disturbed by the rhymes of Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: "twp" in Wales means "uncontrollable" and "pwp" means a defective act.
CHA from the Wales Party stated that his group was “no satisfied” and offered alternatives.
One of the welsh conservators said that his group was "no prejudice" about the change of the name, but noted that MWP could quickly become "mappet".
In this context, the words of the welsh letter “w ” are similar to the yorkshire English phrase “u”.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing legislation to change names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves.”
The Law on Wales’ self - rule since 2017 gives Wales the Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public discussion of proposals, and the rename of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales was widely supported.
As regards what the CHA calls, the Commission suggests that they be referred to as “members of Parliament of Wales”, WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest public support.
CHA, of course, offers alternatives, but attempts to agree may cause problems to the head of Elin Jones, who should submit a draft change law for a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the work of the Assembly, including the CHA rules and the structure of the committee system.
The HA will make a final vote on its new name when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians are going to vote for a referendum on the change of the country’s name
On Sunday, the voters vote whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The voting was organized to resolve a multiannual dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
The Athens have long claimed that their north neighbor’s name is a claim in Greece, and they have repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who speaks against the referendum on the change of name, said that he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, referendums, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is just a price to pay for the EU and NATO entry.
St. Martin's calls are silent because Harlem's churches have been through difficult times
“ The old people I have spoken to say that there was a bar and a church earlier on every corner, ” says Mr. Adams.
Now there is no one nor any other."
He believes that the extinction of bars can be understood:
"Now people are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer such a local living room where they regularly enter."
As regards churches, Adams fears that money from the sale of assets is not enough for long as the leaders expect, and “before or later, they will find themselves where they started. ”
The churches, he added, can replace houses with condoms, and there will be people who will not help the holinesses that remain close.
“ Most people who buy condomies in these houses will be white, ” explained Adams, “this will accelerate the day when all these churches are closing, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to the condoms will become their residents. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolitan: the Metropolitan community church was built in 1870, and Saint Marten was ten years after it.
The root white methodistic community left here in the 1930s.
The black communities conducting the ceremony nearby received the right to building.
St. Marthen went to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard John Johnson, who was headed by the boycott of small traders on the 125th street, the main Harlem trading street, and these traders didn't want to take black people to work and expanse them by service.
In 1939 the fire had severely damaged the building, but Johnson’s father’s parishes wanted to rebuild it and set up a carilion.
Reverend David Johnson, son and heir of father Johnson in St. Marthen, proudly called the poor ring of the poor.
The expert who played a carilion in July called it a different way: “Cultural treasure” and“insequent historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilion in the world in which a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who was transferred to a larger carilion in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merrivezer, there was no replacement in St. Marthen.
What happens in St. Marthen over the last few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of which were involved by the leaders of the church, others by the Bishop's eryphy.
The Council, the governing body of parish, which consists of the leaders of the Mirians, wrote the ecphysia in July that the eparchy “will try to transfer expenses” of joy when the council did not participate in the rental of architects and contractors sent by the ectrisia.
Some of the parishes complained about the lack of transparency by the eparchya.
The shark traumatized a 13-year-old boy who sneaked after lobsters in California.
According to officials, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and traumatized him, and the boy sneaked at the lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
The attack occurred nearly at 7 a.m. near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was swimming with his friends about half an hour when he heard the boy calls for help, and with a group he swimmed to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought that it was just an impression of a catched lobster, but then realized that the boy was screaming: “I was bitten!
I was tasted!"
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his key was completely broken.
“ I shouted to all of them to go out of the water, “in the water of the shark! ” he added.
The boy was delivered to the Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was in critical state.
The shark's type of attack is unknown.
The savior Captain Larry Giles on the media briefing told me a few weeks ago, the shark was noticed in this area, but it was established that it was not referring to dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic damage from the top of the tulub.
For the purpose of the investigation and security, the authorities closed access to the beach for 48 hours from the beach of Ponto in Casablade to Swami in Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to go to the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using cosmetic islands similar to those in universities. Work on islands will be qualified sellers.
In the framework of an increased exit to the British cosmetic market, 2,8 billion pounds of sterlings (continues to grow while the volume of sales of clothing and house supplies is declined) the increased cosmetic islands will be protested in 11 shops around the country. In the next year, if the idea is successful, the islands will appear in other shops.
Investments in cosmetics are linked to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways of using the politics space used earlier under television, microwave caves and house storage.
Sainsbury's claimed that they would double the cosmetic assortiment and offer up to 3,000 goods, such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space: brand zones like those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also updates Boutique's cosmetic assortiment: now most of the goods presented will not be protested on animals, which is increasingly required by young buyers.
Furthermore, the fragrance Shop parfume seller protests his trays in two Sainsbury shops: the first tray opened in Croydon, north London, last week, and the second opens in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and transition to shopping small food volumes every day in small shops make supermarkets make additional effort to include visitors.
Mike Cooper, Executive Director of Sainsbury's, said that their shops would be more like university because the supermarket network is trying to resist Aldi and Lidl's discs with a large number of services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's opens Argos departments in hundreds of their shops, also opened a series of Habitats. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claims that it increased the sale of food goods and made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to update cosmetic and pharmaceutical products has failed.
Sainsbury's tested collaboration with boots in the early 2000s, but it ended up after arguing about how to separate revenues from adolescents in supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after Sainsbury's sold their pharmaceutical business (281 pharmacy) Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds of sterlings three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help to add a expanded luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills Hix, the Sainsbury Commercial Director, said: “We have changed the appearance of our islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasant for buyers.
We also invested in specially trained consultants who could give advice.
The brands that we represent are called to satisfy any needs, and the pleasant environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is competitive to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "recommended" because Holly Willowby made an agreement worth 11 million pounds of sterlings
The star of the Dragon League Peter Jones "recommended" because the television leader Holly Willobey had made an agreement with his brand of life goods (the contract valued 11 million pounds of sterlings) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willowby has no time for the brand of house clothing and the Truly accessors.
Business couples were related to the Goop Guinet Peltrow brand.
The 37-year-old leading program This Morning announced its entry to Instagram.
Holly Willowby led Peter Jones’s star to a spell when at the last time he left their profitable business of life to focus on the new profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources are reported that Jones' "dischools" when the golden girl from the TV confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at Jones' business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts are worth 1,5 million pounds of sterlings that she has no longer time to dedicate her to their common brand of house clothing and accessors Truly.
This business was linked to Goop Guinet Peltrow's brand and had to double the wealth of Willoughby, which was estimated at 11 million pounds of sterlings.
When 37-year-old Willowby told Instagram that it was coming from Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source reported: “Truly was no doubt Holly’s priority.
He had to become its long - term future for the next few decades.
Willoby’s decision to leave business was amazed by all the interested parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, nearly before the launch.
In the headquarters in Marlow's full store of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the entry of the leading This Morning, one of the most highly paid stars of Britain, could cost the company millions because of large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and house clothing) and create further delays with launch.
This may also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willowby and her husband Dan Boldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willowby and Capp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of the government in March.
The couples held holidays together, and Jones has 40 percent of the shares of the Baldwin company, which is a TV producer.
Willowby will be the Ambassador of the M&S Brand and replace Anthony McPartlin as leading I'm A Celebryty with ITV.
The source near Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his matters."
Hard conversation, “and then we fell in love ”
He was joking about the criticism that he received from the press for a comment that someone would view as “unpresidency” as well as a very positive attitude to the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Tramp take such great actions? ”
Tramp said, imitating the voice of the leading news. —
I didn't do anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Tramp called their first meeting in Singapore in June, a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations went into a deaf corner.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, the leading diplomat of North Korea Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has not seen the “relevant response” from the United States to its first disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to sanctions to support pressure.
Tramp was much more optimistic when he spoke on his appointment.
“ We have a good relationship with North Korea, ” he said. “
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have such beautiful relations."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of the missile trials, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American military officers home.
He also protected his unusual approach when he talked about relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave as president, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle of a stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there," Tramp said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and Indonesia’s earthquake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the earthquake in Lomboc, foreign non - government organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboca population have suffered, the national disaster has not been declared, and this is a reconsideration for international assistance.
“ In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they were not looking for international assistance, so it is a little complicated, ” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although “Salvation of children ” is gathering a team to travel to Palo until it is not known whether foreign personnel can work in place.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the National Agency for Disaster Elimination, stated that the Indonesian authorities appreciate the situation in Palo to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Given the continuation of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains terriblely unprepared to anger.
In the province of Aceh, there are accommodations from tsunami, but they are not characteristic to other coasts.
The apparent absence of a siren warning about the tsunami in Palo, although the warning was likely active, had likely contributed to death.
To move between a number of Indonesian islands not only in the best times.
Stich disasters make logistics more complicated.
The medical ship that was in Lomboc to treat the victims of the earthquake is flying to Palo, but reaching a new disaster can at least three days later.
President Joco Vidodo has improved Indonesia’s infrastructure as a basis for his election campaign and increased the costs for roads and railways.
But the deficit of financing caused problems for Mr. Jocco's administration, who plans to reorganize next year.
Mr. Joco also interferes with the continuing interfaith enemy in those parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands expelled from their homes as a result of the opposition of Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets with the use of machete, ports, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

The Statue of Cromwell near Parliament becomes a new monument that suffers from the "rewing history"
The skipping of the statue would be an earmarked reimbursement for the destruction in the Taliban style of many cultural and religious artifacts of England, which his fanatical puritans had committed.
But the Communities of Cromwell called Mr. Creek's proposal "idiotic" and "the attempt to overwrite history."
John Goldsmith, head of the Communities of Cromwell, said: “In view of the current debate on the withdrawal of statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace was inevitable.”
During the English civil wars, the iconistence was not carried out by either Cromwell or by his command.
Cromwell is likely to be sacrificed by his precedent Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell of the sculptor William Hamo Thornecroft is a testimony of the 19th century's mood and part of the history of the figure, which many still believe to be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Well, many who are likely more at the end of the 19th century than now, consider Cromwell a parliament defender against external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether such a concept is completely precise, it is the subject of historical debates that last.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has identified the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the famous figures that represent one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protectors are also worth celebrating and honoring."

More than 20 million people have been watching the hearing of Brett Cavano
On Thursday, over 20 million people in six television networks observed the exciting testimony of a candidate at the post of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano and Christine Blaze Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual violence that appeared to have occurred in the 1980s.
Political opposition continued, the channels interrupted the planned programs to report Friday's last news: the agreement prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake on the FBI's one-week investigation on the charge.
Ford informed the Senate Court Committee that she was 100% convinced that Cavano was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at the high school party.
Cavano in his emotional testimony said that he was 100 percent convinced that it was not.
It's quite likely that more than 20.4 million people were observed on Friday, as reported by the research company Nelsen.
The company estimated the average CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Unable to get numbers on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In Nelsen, there are also problems with measuring the number of people watching television in offices.
In comparison, such audience is like audience that watches the playoff series match or the Oscar prize.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders of the thoughts were strongly supported by Cavano’s appointment, was the leader of all the channels during the all-day hearing, with a average of 5,69 million viewers, noted in Nelsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to representatives of Nelsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC — 2.94 million, in MSNBC — 2.89 million, in CNN — 2.2 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the central figure of the Friday Drama.
The office of this moderate republican issued a statement that he would vote for Cavano, then on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras fixed as the protesters screamed at Flake when he tried to go on the elevator to hear the Court Committee.
He was standing with a few minutes screwed with his eyes, which was broken directly on CNN.
“ I stand right in front of you, ” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power, and a lot of women are unpowered."
Flake reported that his office had published a statement and, before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more in the hearing of the committee.
All cable and broad - language channels were broadcast hours later, when the Court Committee had to vote for the promotion of Cavano candidacy for the voting to the Senate in full.
Flake said he would only do that if he knew that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, what the democratic minority requires.
Flake partially convinced the conversation with his friend, senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Kuns and then with a few more senators, Flake made a decision.
The choice of Flake had an impact, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to appoint Cavano’s candidacy without investigation.
President Tramp has initiated the FBI investigation on the charges against Cavano.

Independence groups spent the night on Friday in the tents to prevent demonstrations from supporting national police.
The demonstration took place, but it had to go another route.
68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electricist who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope that Catalonia could get independence anymore.
“ Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry from joy that can vote, but now we are in a deaf corner,” he said.
Despite the victory of life, but a very complex victory in the regional elections in December last year, the catalan party acting for independence has failed to save the impulse this year, because many of their most famous leaders are in a voluntary exile or prison in the expectation of the court for their participation in the referendum and the further declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanist who took the protest on the police's support on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by politics on both sides.
“ The tension is increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriel Hunkeras, one of the nine catalonic leaders, who are in the investigation isolation from the end of the year last, announced that next year he will be chatting to the European Parliament.
"The status of the candidate at European elections is the best way to condemn the reress of democratic values and repressions that we see from the Spanish government," he said.

Menghi's hit has provided Levingstone victory over Rangers with 1-0 account
The first goal of Dolly Menga in Levingstone has become victory
The exalted Levingston class amazed Rangers and brought Steven Gerard the second defeat of 18 games as an IBROX Club manager.
The struck of Dolly Menga turned out to be crucial: Gary Holt's team rose to one level in a second from the Hybernian.
Gerard's team has not won any victory on the departure of the season of Premier, and next Sunday he'll play with the Hurts leaders, and it's going to be eight points away.
Rangers will be accepted on Thursday in Vienna within the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, Levingston continues its invincible move to six games in the division, and the chief Coach Holt has not been defeated after Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Levingston misss the chances of the unfaithful guests.
The Holt team was supposed to be ahead a long time before they killed, because their clarity creates the Rangers of all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but hit along the gate, then Alan Lithow broke through the gate after he came across and accepted the attack of Craig Halckett along the gate that he made his head.
The masters were satisfied that they allowed Rangers to play before them, and they knew they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
So it was a decisive goal.
The Rangers missed a free blow, and Levingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson acted on Menga, who took the ball and killed from the fine center.
Until that stage, the Rangers were dominated by the ball, but the protection of the masters of the field turned out to be inconvenient, and the gateway of Liam Kelly was not mostly disturbed.
This trend continued in the second time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to hit Kelly’s direction.
The hit of Scott Pittman reflected with the legs of the Rangers, Allan McGregor. Litgow hit the gate in another Levingstone standard combination.
The navys were constantly flying into the Levingstone Penalty and constantly neutralized, and two tools were denied after the Halket attack on Glenn Middlton, who came in and played with the hand.
Levingstone phenomenon: Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena stadium
The phenomenal game and the result of Levingstone.
Everybody played a great one, they continued to exceed the expectations on this east trajectory.
Their play style and storage style almost changed after returning to the highest level, but it is necessary to give Holt the right thing for how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played great, very well organized defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall to keep watch.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerard’s leadership, but now they do not make much of these standards.
They didn't have the last ball -- only once they broke the defense of the owners of the field -- and it was kind of a wake-up for the Rangers that were in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was unanimously accepted in Kelna
On Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and Germany leaders met in Berlin, smiles and blue sky were seen.
This is the last day of the contradictory visit of President Erdogan to Germany to restore the relationship between NATO allies.
There were some disputes between them about human rights, freedom of press and the introduction of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Kelna to open a huge new mosque.
The most Turkish population in the city is outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police didn't let 25,000 people gather before the machete, but many president's supporters came close to seeing him.
The hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — among them many Kurds — also forced themselves to hear, condemning Erdogan’s politics and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The bilateral protests show the unequality of a guest, which some German Turks called a hero, while others are a dictator.

Uragan Rosa threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City by floods (the dry territory may be useful)
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but this may happen at the beginning of the next week, since the remains of the hurricane Rosa are going across the southwest of the desert, creating a risk of floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about flood floods on Monday and Tuesday in the West Arizona area to southern and eastern Nevada, South-east California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday night will rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix observed in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones had preserved the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) from Phoenix since 1950,
and Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) from the Arizona border.
According to the recent predictions of the National Hurricane Centre, Mogolon Rome area in Arizona is predicted from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and places up to 1.24 cm declines.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Pool, are probably going to get from 2,54 to 5.08 inches of decline, maybe 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of floods, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing, since the region suffers from drought.
Although the floods are a very serious problem, some of these floods are likely to be useful because the southern west is now under drought.
According to the American Drought Monitoring Centre, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffer from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest drought category, reports the weather.com.
First of all, the way hurricane Rosa leads to slopes on the Mexican Peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in the hurricane with the maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenea, Mexico, and moves north with 19.3 km per hour.
The storm faces colder water in the Pacific, so it is weakened.
Thus, when a tropical storm is forced on the day or evening of Monday, the hurricane is expected to cause a displacement in Mexico.
The number of rainfalls in some parts of Mexico may be significant, which creates a significant risk of floods.
“The total declines from the bottom of California to the north-west of Sonora are expected to be between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, places may be up to 25.4 cm,” reports weather.com.
Rosa will then go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the border of Arizona early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue through Arizona, and the late night will reach South Utah on Tuesday.
“The basic danger that Rosa or her remains is expected is very strong rain in the Lower California, the northwestern Sonore, and the southwest of the American desert, ” reports the National Centre of Hurricanes.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life - threatening floods and streams of trash in deserts, as well as landscapes.

“When a tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and did not start running immediately, and they became victims,” said the briefing at Jackarty Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, representative of the Indonesian Agency for the elimination of the consequences of disasters (BNPB).
“It was not just tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit all that was on the land,” Nougroho said, added that before hitting the coast line, tsunami went through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/hour).
In order to get away from tsunami, some people climbed into trees and survived, he added.

More than 300 000 people live there, says the Red Cross statement, and it adds that his personnel and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
“ It's already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger, ” says the report.
On Saturday, the agency received a wide criticism for not reporting what the tsunami hit Palo, although officials said the waves came at the time indicated in the warning.
In the amateur records that people shared in social networks, the man on the top floor of the house is exclaiming a frequent warning about the approach of tsunami to people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the wall of water hit the shore, taking the buildings and cars.
Reuters failed to verify the reality of the frames immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a serious defusion of electricity, which broke the connection around Palo, which has complicated the coordination of rescue.

Reper Canye West is changing his name to Y.
On Saturday, when he announced a change in Twitter, he wrote: “Optionally known as Canye West.”
41-year-old West was called Ye for a while, and he used this shortcut as a name for his album released in June.

So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The Canya, which means "one," was cut down to just Y -- it's just the reflection of our good, bad, our confused, everything.
Album is more reflective of what we are."

Former colleague Westa, J.J.I., also experimented with defis and large letters.
President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez, Obrador, promised never to use the army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of a bloody debate over students.

United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
Since China is increasing in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend in research in this area, the investor and practice in the field of SHI Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were given after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about S.I., although there is no formal strategy in the S.I.A.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: he wants to become number 1 on innovation in the field of SIE until 2030.
"Double budget for S.I. research would be a good start, taking into account that all other countries are far away from the United States and we are preparing for the next S.I. breakthrough," Lee said.
The double funding could double the probability of the next major achievement in the S.I. will be made in the United States, Lee said this week in the CNBC interview.
Lee, whose book “China, the Silicon Valley and the new world order” was published this month, is the Director-General of the Sinovation Ventures Fund, who invested in Face++, one of the most famous S.I. companies in China.
In the 1980s, in Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on the S.I. system, which played the best American player in Othello, and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee marked the previous competition from the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advocacy Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when the next time will be to help identify the next perspective participants.
U.S. researchers often need to work hard to win government funds, said Lee.
“This is not China taking away academic leaders, it is corporations,” he noted.
Facebook, Google, and other technological companies have been hiring lights from the Universitys to work on S.I.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to increase the efforts in the SIS.
"I think the Green map should be automatically offered to S.I. candidates," he said.
China’s state council published its Artificial Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
The National Fund for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to persons working in academic institutions, just as the National Scientific Fund and other U.S. government organizations share money to American researchers, while the quality of academic work in China below, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence has created a Joint Intelligence Centre to involve partners from industry and academic circles, and the White House announced the creation of the Special Intelligence Committee.
Also this month, DARPA announced the investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
With regard to the National Scientific Fund, he is now investing more than 100 million dollars per year in the SIS research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislative authority, who seeks to create a Commission for National Security of Artificial Intelligence, has not made any steps for a few months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of country’s name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday on a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would allow Greece to solve a multiannual dispute that blocked Macedonia from the possibility of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the north neighbor is a claim in its territory, and put a veto on the introduction of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments made a treaty based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the treaty claim that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in a referendum, and a boycott campaign raised doubts whether the emergence of the minimum 50% voters would be reached, which would allow the referendum to be deemed to be effective.
Questions in the referendum are: "Do you support membership in NATO and the EU under the conditions of accepting an agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created after the decline of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for the introduction of bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonia's youths, so that she could live free under the European Union's estimation, because this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski in Skopje.
Although the result of voting is not legal, enough members of the parliament have claimed that they will support it to make it decisive.
Two-third votes in the parliament will be required to change the name.
The State Election Commission stated that there were no violation reports until 1:00 p.m.
However, the phenomenon was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters were thrown into their bullets.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old elector Goze Tanevski in Skopje capital.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Duško voted in a referendum on the change of the country's name, which opens the way to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Volodimir Cavardarkov prepared a small scene and set up chairs in front of tents organized by those who would bounce the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proudly raised head, not through the service door," Kavardarkov said. “
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can contact others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European and Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev believes that NATO membership will bring many necessary investments to Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
"I believe that the majority votes for more than 80% of our citizens are speaking for the EU and NATO," Zayev said after the vote.
He pointed out that the result of “yes ” would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, the referendum will participate between 30 and 43 percent of the voters, which is below the necessary phenomenon.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian Television Channel, 57 percent respondents are planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them claimed to vote for.
In order to recognise the referendum to be valid, the phenomenon must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious strike in the Western government's policy since the beginning of its work in May last year.
See: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City is passing the whole Brayton defense and killing the goal
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have passed the defense of Bryton and have won the Manchester City with a 2-0 account on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's hall at the 65th minute, the match looked ridiculous simple.
The Argentine attacker received a passage in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three Bryton Protectors and found himself in the open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four green ones.
He circled over one protector, then circled a few more on the edge of the Briton fine.
Then he made a dog left by seeing Sterling.
The English Forward made the first touch on the penalty to give Aguero the ball, which his right bottom launched it on the right side of the gate, defeating the Brayton holkeeper, Matthew Ryan.

Shercer wants to take the scores from Roxis.
Since the Washington Nashonals team came out of the playoff, there were no significant reasons to wait for another start.
But shercer's tendency to competitiveness hopes to go to the Pitcher bitter on Sunday in a fight against Colorado Rokis, provided that Roxis will still have difficulties with playoff exit. Now, Rockis is on one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.

Why should I not want to take part in this racing?

Tramp Mittings in Western Virginia
The President reiterated the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano when he spoke of the importance of the phenomenon of the Republicans at the medium-term elections.
“All we have done will be placed on the map in November.
There will be one of the most important choices in our life in five weeks.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I'm fighting for wonderful candidates everywhere I can," he said.
Tramp continued: "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of democrats, you see it happens now.
And they're determined to restore power by using any means, you can see maliciousness, shit.
They don't care who suffers from them, who needs to be violated in order to get power and control, they want powers and control, we are not going to give them."
The democratic mission, he said, "confront and obstacle."
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "the wicked and malicious, the disgusting and the liar."
He mentioned the Senate Court Committee, named the Democratic Senator Diane Finstein by the name, which caused the audience to the loud crying of displeasure.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you give you a document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm expecting -- it was really a bad language of body movements -- the worst language of the body movements I've ever seen."
The Laborist Party is no longer a wide church.
It is not tolerant to those who express their views.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted for me to be convicted, it was almost unexpected.
Finally, I'm the last of those Laborers to Parliament that they've been informed that they're unhappy, and that's all because we're expressing our opinion.
My colleague in the Parliament, Joan Ryan, were treated almost the same way because she was decisive against antisemitism.
I was convicted for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
As regards the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, about Europe, these questions are ironicly similar to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the meeting of the Nottingham East says Friday, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the Friday Friday meetings of the General Committee for my eight years as a local member of the Parliament of Laborists were just like that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a very different tone, and the promise of a “great, more soft ” policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it was ever started.
It becomes increasingly evident that the Laborist Party does not accept different views, and every thought is appreciated from the position of whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader, and my colleagues, as I thought before, had similar political views, began to expect me to turn around 180 degrees and accept positions that I would never agree, whether national security or the only EU market.
Every time I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what I'm saying -- it follows the tissue of attacks in social networks with calls for revocation, the conviction of the center policy, I'm told that I should not be at the Laborist Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I have been lucky more than some of my colleagues, since the comments I usually have directed are political.
I am delighted at professionalism and the determination of the colleagues who daily face the streams of sexist or racist attacks, but they never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that the levels of abuse have become a standard.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Laborist Party should raise a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a wider church, and with every movement of "belief" or changing the rules of selection, the party is steady.
During the last two years, I was encouraged to keep up, not speak so loudly that “everything is good. ”
But that's not why I came to politics.
I joined the Laborists 32 years ago as a school student, because because the government lacked attention from the government, Tatcher, my class in high school, has literally broken down, since then I've been trying to improve the quality of state services for those who need them most, whether the local advisor or the minister of government.
I never hid my policy, including in the last elections.
No one at Nottingham East was disturbed by my political views and disputes with today’s leadership.
For those who have contributed to the Friday events, I just want to say one thing: if the country moves to Brexit, which would harm households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, both the members of the Laborist Party, and not: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no threat to calling me back and no political advantage will prevent me from acting according to what I think is the best interest of all of you.

"Air" 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeaten Air are rising up
Two recent attempts may have corrupted the final outcome, but no doubt the Air deserved a triumph in the today's wonderful entertainment game of the Prime Minister of Scotland.
Now they're leading the table, that's the only invincible team of ten.
Finally, a wonderful defence and improved ability to use opportunities gives the masters and coach Peter Mercy the right to be satisfied.
"We have been testing our games, and we are still invincible, so I must be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christy, from Melrose, commented: "I give the right "Eire," they'd better use the chances than we did."
The attempt of Grant Anderson at the 14th minute, Frazy Climo, led forward, but the yellow card for Scotch Captain Rory Hughes, Verriors, released, allowed Melrose to show the figures, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Climo reinforced the Air leadership through the toolbar and did and performed a solo-test, which gave the account 17-5 for the benefit of the Air.
But Melrose started the second time, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, which was implemented by Baggot, decreased the breakdown to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, who was taken out of the field on the cargo, and the Air Restaurant ran forward through the attempt of Stafford McDowell, which was carried out by Climo.
Captain Blair McFerson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose made another player pay the unreasoned attempt of Bruce Colvin under severe pressure.
The masters returned, however, when Struan Hatchinson got a yellow card for Climo's capture without a ball from the line of the fine landing, McFerson made a tachdown behind the Eire Mall.
Climo made an attempt that he did almost every time after the restart, then Kyle Row received a hit from David Armstrong into the box and sent Gregor Henry's flanker to the fifth attempt of the owner's team.
Apparently, the star of the "All Game" is set up for a new career in a restaurant area.
It seems that the star of the "All Game" Ford Kiran is set up for a new career in the field of hospitality, and that can be concluded after it became known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC TV, the scenario he writes to and in which he's filming with a old comedian partner, Greg Hamfield.
Duet announced that the future nineth series would be the last one in the series, and it seems that Kirnan plans life after Craigleng.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source in Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter the “prosperous restaurant” of Glasgo.
“Sea Our”: Interior Bolivia hopes that the court will open her way to the Pacific
The seamen are patroling the fleet headquarters in La Pas.
The public buildings hang the ocean-blue flag.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are painted by the motto: “Weather is our right.
We must bring it back."
In Bolivia, which has no way to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of a coastal line that went away from Chile in the 19th century's bloody conflict through natural resources, and there is a desire to swim again in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in the last decades, because Bolivia is waiting for a decision from the international court on October 1, after five years of consideration of the case.
“Bolivia has a impulse, a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, she expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many of the Bolivians will observe the ICU’s announcement on large screens around the country, and they hope that the Hague tribunal will decide for the benefit of Bolivia, that after decades of breaking talks, Chile will make the negotiations of Bolivia of the sovereign sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic root president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his revolution in the next year, also puts great hopes on a decision that will be announced on Monday.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court can hardly decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and if that happens, there will be little changes.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no authority to condemn the Chile territory and notes that it will not determine the result of possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the ICTY was taken only six months after the final arguments were given indicates that the case was “not complex”, said Pas Zarate, Chilean expert in international law.
Bolivia’s case has not been promoted; the last four years have been able to contribute backwards.
"The question of access to the sea was used by today's Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
The warrior of Morales exploded the remains of Chile’s kindness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue dialogue at a time, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodrigues Weltze, a representative of Bolivia in Hague, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be “a extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and the chance to end 139 years of diversity by getting mutual benefits,” he said.
Calsadia also denyed that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the marine issue as a political mill.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This decree is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if she can't trust the United States
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho said that his country would never give up its nuclear weapons before he could trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises expressed during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of competitive countries.
His comments appeared when the US Secretary Mike Pompeo seemed to be on the edge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which went into a deaf corner more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen Yen.
Rei says that the belief that the continuation of sanctions and resistance of the United States of the declaration of the end of the Korean war will once put North Korea on knees is a “infinished dream. ”
Washington fears to take the declaration before Pyyenan takes significant disarmament steps.
Kim and American President Donald Tramp want a second meeting.
But there is a widespread scepticism that Phenyan seriously considers the rejection of his arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Tramp.
The last trend of massive main clothing was presented in Paris’ fashion shows, which is already on the main streets of your city.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
Valentino and Tom Brown designers showed a number of excentric main clothings in the style of overlays from spring summer 2019 on the floors of a brilliant Paris week of fashion.
Very irregular hats captured Instagram this summer, and the named designers have already sent their embarrassing creatures outside the floor.
Valentino made an extravagant beach hat with widely decorated feather fields that closing the heads of the models.
Among others, overlays-accessors are decorated by precious stones of the café, the wizard hat, and even the hat-ananas, but they are not to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also showed the asortimation of original masks — very timely before Halloween.
Many of these colored masks had sewed lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than a high fashion.
One of the creations reminded the apparatus for the submarine swimming with the tube and the glasses, the other looked like an ice cream that was melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stilists say that huge hats can come out on the main streets of your city.
The overlays capes came into fashion by the Le Bombi, a slammed hat with the fields of sixty-inch width, which they saw in all: from Rianna to Emily Ratazkovski.
A cult brand behind a very irregular hat, which could be seen everywhere in social networks, gave peace another creation: a slammed beach bag sizeed almost like a model in a bathtub that was carrying it.
The purse with the yellow-red raphia with a bachrome of raphia and a white skin pen was the central element of the La Riviera collection spring summer 2019 of Jacquemus brand on the Paris week of fashion.
The famous artist Luke Armitaz told Fmail: “The next summer I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of the cities, because the designer’s influence is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for overlays-accessors.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is mandatory for citizens of the world
Independent schools of Scotland support high standards of education, and in 2018 there have been reappropriate results of examinations that complement individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music, and other areas.
These schools, in which more than 30,000 students in Scotland are presented by the Scotland Council of Independent Schools (SHRS), seek to provide the best level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools have to prepare students for a further and higher education chosen by their career, and make them citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can develop and introduce a individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable object for the selection in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in the language he understands, he considers it intelligence.
If you speak to her in her own language, she takes it to her heart. ”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot only use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The latest results of this year's tests show that in independent language schools, they are leading in the ratings of best-estimated objects.
In general, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received higher A score.
The data collected in 74 SRNS schools showed that 72% of the students received a higher score A from Chinese and 72% of the German students, 69% of the French students, and 63% of the Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will need in the future.
The languages as a selection object are now classified as NTIM objects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), within independent school programmes and in other institutions.
A study conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why employers cannot close vacancies related to the lack of language skills.
So language skills are increasingly needed in preparing youths for future career.
Since more prospective positions need knowledge of languages, these skills are necessary in the globalized world.
Whatever the career is chosen, if someone learns the second language, he'll have a real advantage in the future, because it's a skill for life.
The possibility of direct communication with people from other countries automatically gives a person who has several languages preferred competitives.
According to the YouGov survey conducted among more than 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75 percent could not speak in foreign language enough to support the conversation, and the French is the only language in which a biscuit percent of people spoke (15 percent).
That's why investments in teaching languages are now important for modern children.
Knowing a number of languages, especially the languages in developing countries, will provide children with more chances to find full - time jobs.
In Scotland, they will study their languages in every school.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for Britain since 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Despite your child’s interests in independent schools, you will always be able to choose several languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scotland’s independent schools are trying to create a educational environment that prepares children and arms them with skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of their future.
Now we can't deny that in the international business environment the language continues to have vital importance for the future country, so it should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered “the skills of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to make this choice, diversity, and perfection of Scotland’s youths.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools

The fans who want to see the first start of Lebron James for Los Angeles Lakers were almost waiting.
Lekers Coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first pre-season match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes will he play, not yet resolved.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the Lakers official site.

After training earlier this week, James asked about his plans for six pre-season schedules of Lakers.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games," he said.
Tramp mittings in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramp is starting today a series of pre-electoral myths from Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned for the next week of Tramp's mything, including the myttings in the friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy proposed to the Supreme Court is delayed, and Tramp wants to form support for future medium - term elections, since the Republicans are risking to lose control of the Congress after the vote in November.
At what hour will Tramp tonight be held in West Virginia, and how will it be viewed on the Internet?
Mitting Trampa in Whilling in West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours by eastern time today, on Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Tramp's tips in Western Virginia online below in the direct air on YouTube.
Tramp is likely to mention the stressful hearing that happened this week about the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the postponing of the Senate's vote for a week, while the FBI investigation continues.
But the main goal of this series of myttings is to help the Republicans get popular before the elections in November.
The representatives of President Tramp stated that these five mytings in the next week are focused on “activization of volunteers and advocates, since the Republicans are trying to save and expand most of the representatives in the Senate and the House,” reports Reuters.
“The Congress Control is so critical for its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible because the season of the pre-election campaign is approaching,” said the Reuters representative of the Tramp campaign, who did not want to call his name.
At the Vesbanko Arena stadium in Wiling today’s meeting, the advocates from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday visit will be the second last month of Tramp’s visit to Western Virginia, the state in which he took over 40% of the votes in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help a candidate from the Republicans to the Western Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisi, whose rating is due to surveys.
“ It is not good for Morrisi that the president is coming to raise his review in the surveys, ” commented Reuters Simon Heather, a politician from the West Virginia University.
Rider's Cup 2018: The United States team is set up to fight and hopes on Sunday Singles
After three sessions ending with one - side victory, afternoon, the Saturday Forsoms may become just what the Rider Cube was missing.
The immediate pulse cartridge is a complete sports concept in which players really believe, especially in similar competitions.
So when do they say that the impulse is working?
"They were in front for six points, and now at four, so I think we take it a little bit like a impulse," said Jordan Spit when he left.
Europe, of course, prefers four points ahead and another twelve in the game.
The Americans feel a little wind in their sails, too, encourages them, not at the end of the form of Speth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each made three points of four.
The spot with his killing punches from the tail to the grain shows an example.
These screaming screams became more loud when in the course of his round, he made a decisive patch and compared the account on the fourth match after he and Thomas were standing back to two points.
His patt, who allowed them to win the game on 15 holes, met with a similar scream, which tells you that the American team doesn't seem to be.
"You really need to try very hard and worry about your own match," said Spit.
That's all that each of these players left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more scores than Spit and Thomas, in the last two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unprotected story of the Rider Cube.
An unusual, but a charming couple in Europe has four of four and cannot make mistakes.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't make a godgy on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to avoid Godgy in the morning on Saturday and afternoon on Friday and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This race and how their energy seems to flow to this raging crowd and back, forces them to believe that they win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Fleetwood or Molinari to strengthen the potential victory of the Europeans when the sun comes over Le Golf National.
Both are wanted on different holes at the same time.
However, talking about the triumph of the Europeans is still early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were deployed with Sergio Garcia, a hero of morning footballs when he was in a couple with Alex Norren.
One godgi and two holes in the first nine holes brought the Spanish and Swedish to the hole that they could never get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to watch for the footballs and forsoms from close to the interaction of the pair participants, because of the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the interesting thing about how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe is currently playing better as a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of Forsoms has also shown that the United States team is intending to fight, and some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with a 10-6 account on the last day of the Rider Cube
On the end of the day, the Rider Cube of Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday Foundation and Forsoms, it's ahead of the United States with a 10-6.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari got two victories over the backing Tyger Woods, and now at Le Golf National, they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to restore the trophy that they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in morning footballs with account 3-1.
The United States made more resistance in the forsoms and won two matches, but they were unable to reduce the breakdown.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in 12 Sundays to save the trophy.
Fleetwood, the first European new man who won four points along, while he and Mollynari (together Mollywood) after the sensible weekends, were only the second pair who took four points in the first four matches in the history of the Cube Ryder.
When they broke Woods and Patrick Rid in the footballs, they joined in to conquer the wandered Woods and the new American Brison Dashambo newly efficiency with even more effective 5th4.
Woods, who pulled two matches on Saturday, showed random explosions of genius, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in the forballs and forsomas and seven matches in a seventy.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning footballs, returned to Henry Stanson’s partner in the forsomas to defeat the account of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coupka, who is the first and third in the world’s rating.
Europe couldn't do anything in her own nice fresh day to the south-west of Paris.
On Saturday, the chief winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with their two points.
They won a decisive victory of 2th1 against the Spanish John Ram and Ian Poulter in the footballs and later defeated Poulter and Rory McClaroy with a 4th3 account in the forsoms, losing two first holes.
Only twice in the history, the Rider Cube came back with a deficit in four points in the singles, although the Furyk team needed nothing to save the trophy.
However, after the second place for two days, the contratact on Sunday looks like they can't.
North Korea says that “in no case” will not be disarmed in unilateral order without confidence
On Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions increases the lack of confidence in the United States, and that in such circumstances, the country will never be able to renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho reported at the United Nations General Assembly that, last year, North Korea has taken “the important measures of goodwill” such as the cessation of nuclear and missile trials, the demonstration of the nuclear testing area and the commitment to not distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We do not see the appropriate response from the United States, ” he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be first armed in a unilateral order."
Although Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea on Washington’s “poath” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, his statement proved to be important because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization of Phenian in the past.
Ri refered to a common statement by Kim Chen and Donald Tramp at the first summit in history between the real President of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim called on to work on the “Danuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and Tramp promised the security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea desires the formal end of the Korean war 1950 - 53 years, but the United States stated that Phenyan should first refuse nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists appeals to weaken severe international sanctions on North Korea.
“ The U.S. insist on “denuclearization first ” and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal violently, and even deny the“completment of war”, ” said Ri.
“ To think that sanctions can put us on the knees, ” is an unreal dream of those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases our lack of confidence."
Ree did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Tramp, which the United States leader stressed at the UN at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to the three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jee Ina in the last five months and added: “If the question of denuclearization was South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a deaf corner.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from the last year when he told the General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles to the land of the United States was inevitable after the "Mr. Evil President" Tramp called Kim "the man-racket" who wanted to commit suicide.
This year, in the United Nations Tramp, who threatened to “further destroy ” North Korea, praised Kim for the courage of taking disarmament measures, but said that there would be much more to do and sanctions should remain in force until the dayuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Tramp noted that he did not set the time frame for this: "It will take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Phenyan for the steps made.
However, U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo stated to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council must continue energyly and inevitable until we see the complete, final, confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council has consequently increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles of Phenyan.
Pompeo met Ri in the United Nations General Assembly circuits and then said that next month he would visit Phenyan again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Phenyan in July and commented on progress made, but a few hours later North Korea convicted him for the gangster requirements.
During the meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to break up a missile complex, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States take the “suitable measures”.
He told him that he needed "suitable measures" as safeguards that Tramp promised in Singapore, and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students course about how to rest
The new course at the Harvard University this year made all of his students more sleep, trying to combat the growing culture of cruel learning all night after the caffeine fuel.
The teacher found that university students number one in the world are often unscientific when it comes to the foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Women’s Brigam Hospital, developed a course that he believes to be the first such course in the United States.
He decided to initiate a course after he talked about the impact of sleeping on teaching.
At the end, one girl approached him and said, “Why do I have this being told at the last class? ”
“ She told her that no one ever told her about the importance of a dream that surprised me, ” said the teacher from the Telegraph.
At the first time this year, students explain the foundations of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results and improve the overall well - being.
Paul Barrayra, a professor of the Harvard Medical School Psychiatric and the Executive Director of the University of Medical Services, said that the university decided to take a course after it was discovered that the students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one chapter, there is a picture of the room in a group where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and light, the deficit of sleep on sports rates, and the importance of the routine associated with sleep.
Another chapter tells the participants how long - time sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, the stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of the students instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the consequences of smoking cigarettes for health," said Professor Chaseler.
Cultural of pride for "sleep all night" still exists, he added, and he also noted that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleeping is increasing.
A sufficient sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon ” of a student to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, even with a set of abundant weight, because the deprivation of sleep translates the brain into a hunger mode that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaseler develop a course after he entered one of his other courses last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to all the aspirants with a request for a similar training program before the arrival of a competitive institution.
Professor Chassler recommends that students remind that they need to go to bed, as well as put a wake-up and be aware of the harmful influence of the blue light, which is administered by electronic screens and light-based lamps, and may violate a circuit rhythm that leads to problems with sleeping.
Levingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal distressed Gerard's boys
"Rangers" survived a turning attack of travelling sadness: Dolly Menga's hit a different team of Steven Gerard defeated the 1-0 account of Levingston.
The Aibrox team wanted to win its first triumph at the triumph after February's triumph over St. Johnston with account 4-1, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard as a 18-hound manager. The Gerard team remained eight points behind the leaders of the Scotland Prime Minister Harts.
Menga screwed up seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers store, which was lacking inspiration, did not seem like it could compare the account.
Now the Rangers are down to the sixth position, and Levingston rises to the third, and only the Hibernian is ahead of them.
Furthermore, the Rangers may face another distress, since the Lyneman Calum Spence had to process the head wound after he was thrown into some object from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that once passed past the Air in the half-final Cube of the Scotland League.
And Holt released the same warehouse of Levi 11, which took one point in the Harts last week, and was delighted when his nursed boys pushed the rivals on every step.
Rangers may have been dominated with the ball, but Levingston has worked more with the ball.
They were only gonna kill in two minutes of the game when the first pass of Menga into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gate of Allan McGregor, but the semi-protector was wasted this big chance by sending a ball by the gate.
The deep free strike of Keahan Jacobs came to Craig Halkett's skipper, but his defence partner Alan Lithow hit the back stack.
Rangers really got control, but in the last third there were more hopes than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos surely felt that he had to get the right on the toolmark on a quarter of an hour after his struggle with Steven Loules, but Steven Thompson rejected the Colombian’s turn.
The Rangers managed only two hits on the gates in the first time, but the former Aibrox gateway, Liama Kelly, the head of Lassana Culibali, and the calm struck of Ovier Ejaria, was scarcely disturbed.
Although the first Levingstone goal for 34 minutes may have contradicted the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only with their hard work.
The Rangers failed to manage Jacobs' cooking again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Menga for a simple ending.
In a break, Gerard replaced Culibals with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the winger broke down to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly arrived from his line to block him.
However, Levingston continued to force guests to play the same game they like when Lithow and Halkett make a long break.
The Holt team could have improved the results in the last stages, but McGregor was well opposed to Jacobs before Lithow hit the corner.
Glenn Middlton, a replacement at the Rangers, made another late request for a fine when he faced Jacobs, but Thompson regained his view.
Almanach: Geiger Inventor
And now the page from our Almanach Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the time goes... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Gaiger.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as Geiger's number.
Since then, the numbering Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of the pop-cultural, for example, in the 1950 "Crown Coronado" film with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play suspicious cowboys-scientists.
A man: “What is this? ”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s number used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these ears, you can really hear how radioactive atoms affect minerals."
Evans: "Well, it's really breaking up right now!"
Gaiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention of his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see ” malicious cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see ” and kill them, and to kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malicious cells that are part of the treatment
The method foresees the elimination of immune cells in the patient and their changes in the lab
Then these cells are able to “see ” proteins that are common to many cancer species, and then these cells reinstat the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who has received a vaccine that teachs the immune system to identify malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the elimination of immune cells in the patient, changing them in the lab so that these cells can “see” common for many types of protein cancer (HER2), and continuing to reintroduce these cells to the patient.
Professor J. Bersofski, at the National Institute of Cancer of Bethesda, Maryland, noted: “Our results show that we have received a very prospective vaccine. ”
"HER2" stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and colored cancer," he explained.
Similar approach, which includes eliminated immune cells in patients and “learning ” to target cancer cells, has worked in treating one of the types of leukemia.
After he showed up in the SNL show studio in the MAGA Canye West baseball, he slipped up with a sharp speech to support President Tramp,
what caused a negative response to the viewers
The watchers in the SNL show studio (Saturday night in direct air) whistled Canyer after his summary talk, while he praised the President of the United States, Donald Tramp, and stated that he would be chatting for the presidential post in 2020.
After performing the third song called Ghost Town in a baseball "We'll return the former glory" he exploded by a tirade in which he exposed the democrats, and reiterated his support to Tramp.
"They often ask me, "How do you like Tramp? He's a racist."
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America for a long time," he said.
Shaw SNL began with Matt Damon's sketch, where the Hollywood Star laughed at the testimony of Brett Cavano, which he gave before the Legal Committee of the Senate in the case of Christine Blazey Ford on sexual violence.
Although the talk of the West was not transmitted directly in the air, the video with its tirade was made in social networks by Chris Rock.
It remains irregular whether Rock wanted to laugh at West by putting that post.
West also complained to the audience that there was an unpleasant situation with him because of the main clothing.
According to the issue of Washington Examiner, West said, "When I was outside, I was acting rudely.
I was told, "Don't go out to the viewers in this baseball."
They've been harassing me!
And then I'm told I'm in a place where the oppressed people are silent."
West continued, "Do you want to see where the oppressed people are silent? I'll wear my superman baseball because no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to the Variety week, his comments had at least twice caused the negative response of the audience in the hall, and the SNL players looked lost.
The news in the last minute was invited to replace Ariana Grande’s singer, whose former boyfriend, reper McMiller, died a few days before the air.
The West called in many surprises by performing the song I Love it (I love it) in the bottle of the water of Perrier.
The news supported the head of the Conservative Organization of TPUSA, Kendes Turner, who wrote on Twitter, "One of the most brave ones: thanks for the one that stood against NATO. "
Instead, the leading show Karen Gunter wrote on Twitter that West is who he is, and it's just great.
"But I will NOT reward it (buying his music or clothing or supporting it" art), who, I think, confess and expose ideology that hurts my community.
He is a free man.
Like us," she added.
Before the show, the reper announced in Twitter that he changed his name: now he's the one used to be known as Canyo Westa.
West isn't the first performer who changed his name, he's imitating Diddy's example, also known as Paff Deddy, Paffy and Pi Diddi.
A colleague-rapper Snoop Dogg was earlier called Snoop Lyon, and, as known, the musical legend of the last decades has changed the name into a symbol, and then became "Article, earlier known as Princes".

The star of the throne game Kit Gerrington condemns the idealization of brutality
Keith Garrington became famous by the role of a warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medium-century fantasy series "Game of thrones" of HBO.
However, 31-year-old actor condemned the stereotype of macho hero, claiming that because of these heroes on the screens, young boys often feel that they should be cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture Cat, he said that he thought "things went wrong," and asked me how to solve the problem of the idealization of brutality in the age of hashtag popularity #Meto #, too, #watch, etc.).
Keith, who recently married his colleague in the Game of thrones, 31-year-old actor Rose Lesley, said that he's "decisively" determined to fight this problem.
"I'm at this point quite determined, and when did we get on a slippery way to idealize brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up because of the prime problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality because of images of extremely courageous heroes.
And he said, "What's natural and what are we planted?
Why does television and street teach that young boys feel pressure to be such men?
I think today is a really important question: How do we change this?
'Cause it's obvious that young boys have gone the right way."
In the interview, he also pointed out that it would not be taken off in any prescriptions and sequels of "The thrones games" after the next summer show, because "he's already done with battles and horses."
From November, Keith will play the real West play, Sam Shepherd, a story about the movie producer and his brother-grab.
As an actor recently confessed, he respected the meeting with his wife Rose the best that he got from participating in the Game of the thrones.
"When I took a picture in this show, I met my wife, so he gave me the future family and set my future life," said Keith.
In a fantastic series that received Emmy's reward, Rose played Igritt, the love of hero of Gerington John Snow.
A couple married in June 2018, and the ceremony was held in the territory of the family of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: In China, a rapid increase of 14 per cent of new cases of disease
In China, 14 per cent of the population with HIV and AIDS reported a dramatic increase.
According to health authorities, more than 820 000 patients are generally in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new diseases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, leading to a change in the past trend.
In some regions, HIV was rapidly spread through infected blood during transfusion.
However, as stated by officials of the health authorities during the conference held in the province of Yunnan, the number of people infected by HIV was almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV in time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decrimination of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to research, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men continue to marry women because of conservative values in the country.
The transmission of the disease in most cases is due to the inadequate use of protective means during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised to provide free access to HIV medicines, seeing this partly solved the problem.
Maxine Watters denies the inflammation of the republic senators in the network of her state worker and criticizes "safe lies" and "theory of conspiracy"
On Saturday, a member of the United States House of Representatives, Maxine Watters condemned a voting statement that one of its officials had placed the personal data of three American republican senators on their website in Wikipedia.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that these statements are spreading "ultraright" political viewers and websites.
"The belly, the lie, and then even more disgusting lies," said Waters in Twitter.
According to reports, the public information included home addresses and phone numbers of United States Senators Lindsay Graham, from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The data appeared on the network on Thursday, and they were placed by an unknown person from the Capitolia during the hearing in the Senate Commission on the charges of sexual offences imposed against Brett Cavano, a candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice.
Some time after the three senators interrogated Cavano, the data came out.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the IP source address was related to the Waters Office and it was able to find the data of its staff colleague.
"It is absolutely false, they don't match the reality," Waters continued.
"A colleague of my office, whose personal data and security are in danger as a result of these fabricated and liar claims, has nothing to do with the source of this information.
These unreasonable claims are absolutely false, they don't match the reality."
The statement Waters was rapidly opened on the network, including the former press secretary of the White House, Ary Flysher.
"It's a denial full of anger," wrote Flysher.
"It suggests that with such a nature, she cannot be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of what he did not do, he does not need to be angry.
The accused should not be acting drunk.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and indistinct."
Apparently, Flysher had a parallel between Waters’ response and the criticism of democrats to Judge Cavano, who was accused of being too angry during hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who is chattering to take the Watters’ seat on the results of the intermediate elections, also expressed his view in Twitter.
"It's the news if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Watters noted that her office had already reported "suitable government authorities and law enforcement authorities on these false statements."
"We will do everything we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they answered the law for their actions that are harmful and dangerous for all my employees."
"Agent Johnny English: New Mission" is the passing parodia for spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It's already been a good tradition to look for in every new British film of ideas, the Brexit. They're also in the new part of a series of comedial parodies for fighters about Johnny English. The first film called "Johnnie English" came on the screen in 2003, and later the series was restarted in 2011, and the "Johnny English: Restart."
Will it be a ridiculous and ironical self-saturation to what we are short, a new nation's export potential?
Anyway, Johnny English, with his motional face and his scratched eyes again, got the opportunity to make a mess, and his name more than anything else indicates that this comic character was created for the viewers in non-angular countries.
As we know, Johnny is a very fun secret agent in which, despite his strange attempts to be galant and charming, there is a little of Clouseau inspector, a little from Mr. Bean and a lot of things -- from the guy who played one tonne of the film of the Fire Cars at the ceremony of the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
The picture of the character is also a traveler and a mystery of the international scale that always left behind a mess that Atkinson once played in a long - forgotten television advertising of Barclaycard.
In the last movie about Johnny English, there are some good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglish in the knight's weapons approached the helicopter, and the shovels of the guinea shoved his helmet.
In the movie, Atkinson's talent is to make up a buffonade, but humor is passing through, and in some moments it's too much, especially if compared to "serious" film brands, like "Agent 007" and "Mission impossible", one of the "ingredients" is also a comedy.
It's like the jokes are rather based on children than on adults, and my stupid attacks with Johnny English don't seem as inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson's jokes in the German movies about Bean.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat over Britain.
The British supersecret network of spys is hackering and revealing the names of all field agents, which has become a total surprise for an active agent (alas, Kevin Eldon played only an episode role in the movie).
This turned out to be the last drop for the Prime Minister, a proud person who has already suffered a destructive criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to best transmit the image of Teresa May, but the scenario has not been able to discover it).
Intelligence advisors informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she had to be involved in some of the retirement agents.
The choice falls to an unfavourable Johnny English, who is now a teacher in some superfashioned institution and informally teachs children to work undercover (in this part with the spy school of the year) English for adolescents had several good jokes).
Englez is delivered to Whitehol for an emergency briefing, where he meets again with his long - suffering friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine boat (the role of an exalted exhaust person does not fully match the talent of Vicki Pepperdin).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went back, "Batman and Robin" are returning to the line and suddenly meet the fatal woman of Ophelia Pistolet, played by Olga Kurillenko.
And at this time, the Prime Minister is in charms of a charming billionaire who earned his wealth in technology and technology and claims that he can eliminate the problem with the British network, the evil Jason Volt, who was played by Jake Lacey.
In English and Buff are sending to their jokes again: dressed by waiters, they are making a fire in a fine French restaurant; they continue to sow chaos by illicitly leaving abroad on a luxury boat of Volta; Englez is making real mess when they try to use the helmet of virtual reality to know the planning of the house of Volta.
All stops lead us to the last episode, but with his kindness and insaneness, he looks like a movie for children.
It's a movie.
Like when I watched other films about Johnny English, I asked myself the same question: Can the British movie industry not offer Rowen Atkinson's role that really matches his talent?
Laborists deny the preparation of the plan that the British will work four days a week, but they'll be paid in five days.
The Laborist Party, Jeremy Corbina, has to discuss a radical plan that the British will work four days a week, but they will be paid in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to oblige the company's leaders to transfer the funds saved as a result of artificial intelligence revolution, giving workers an extra weekend.
Thus, workers will have a three - day weekend, bringing home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea will respond to the economic programme of the Party and direct the resources of the country to support the working class.
A four-day working week was approved at the British Congress of Tred Juniones, and it is estimated that the workers will be able to benefit from the change in the economic situation.
The source in the Laborist Party reported the issue of the Sunday Times as follows: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
It will not change in one night, but the idea of a four-day working week is the approach of the party to change the economic balance for workers and the general industrial strategy of the Party."
Laborists didn't first accept this idea, since the Green Party promised to initiate a four-day working week during the pre-electoral campaign in 2017.
However, not all members of the Laborist Party approve of this desire at present.
Speeker of the Laborist Party said, "The political programme of the party is not foreseen to introduce a four-day working week, so we're not considering this idea now."
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the pre-election of the Laborist Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to retrieve power from the "free directors" of communities and "consumers".
The Shadow Officer's plan also means that water supplies shareholders can not get their entire share of capital if the Laborist government brings "counting" on the basis of imaginary infringements.
He also reaffirmed the intention to include employees in the company management and create inclusive stock funds to deliver 10% of the ordinary shares of private sector companies to workers waiting for annual dividends of up to 500 pounds of sterlings.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are telling at 60 Minutes (60 minutes) or can Cavano's investigation leading by the FBI change their views
In connection with the investigation of the prosecution against Judge Brett Cavano, who runs the FBI, the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court is postponed for at least a week.
In the Sunday Show 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelly asked John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham the republic senators if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
'Yes, of course,' said Kennedy.--
During the hearings, I told you that I had a conversation with Judge Cavano.
I called him after everything happened and came up with the accusation, and asked him: “You really did it? ”
He was decisive, firm, compromiseless."
It appears that Greem’s viewpoint is no longer going to change.
"I think Cavano's accusations are provocation," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know what, Brett denied everything firmly," he added Greem, turning to Christine Blazey Ford.
And everyone who she calls can't confirm it under oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't understand what can change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York, the Festival Global Citizen Festival (The World Citizen Festival) – an annual event in the music world with an incredible number of star performers and not less disturbing mission — to overcome poverty throughout the world.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be crowded on the Great Gallage of the Central Park, not only to enjoy the talks of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez, as well as to draw attention to the real purpose of the festival, organizers seek to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Festival Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization, which is expected to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who will fight it actively.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (if you don't want to pay VIP tickets), visitors have to perform a series of tasks or "deeds" as they teach in a volunteer project, write an email to the world's leader, make a phone call or anything else to help draw attention to the purpose of the organization -- the elimination of poverty.
So have there been any results, since the objective of the Global Citizen organizers remained for 12 years?
Is it really the idea of rewarding for a free concert -- a genius way to convince people to require action, is it just another case of so-calctivism, when people feel that they really change something by signing an electronic petition or making a publication in Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have fixed 19 million "deeds" of their advocates to achieve different goals.
The Organization claims that these acts have motivated world leaders to claim planned financial appropriations and programmes for more than 37 billion dollars, which will help to change their lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group presented as an example of the results of its 390 financial obligations and public claims, with at least 10 billion already been collected and spent.
According to the estimates, the funds provided have been directly affected by about 649 million people around the world.
Among the main financial obligations, you can remember the Power of Nutrition, which is territorially referring to Britain. In the context of the project, investors and implementers have undertaken to "help the children to grow" and promised to give Rwanda 35 million dollars of assistance to address the problem of malnutrition after they received more than 4700 messages in Twitter from the Global Citizens organization.
"With the support of the British government, the members, the governments of other countries and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make a social problem of under-fooding a small fact of history," the representative of the Organization of Power of Nutrition Tracy Ullman said, speaking before the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5000 "deeds", which encouraged the improvement of mothers and children's nutrition, the British government announced that the funds for the The Power of Nutrition project were made to improve the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome the extreme level of poverty?"
The representatives of Global Citizen wrote, "It's a long and difficult way, so sometimes we fall down and we're failing.
But, like the participants of the movements for civil rights and against the apartheid to us, we will be successful because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the group of the Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Genelle Mona, are only part of the star performers that will be presented in New York this year and will be held by Deborah Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The Minister of Interior stated that the United States could use military forces to "block" to prevent the export of Russian energy.
According to the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, Washington may, if necessary, ask for assistance to the military forces to prevent the exit of Russian energy to markets, including the Middle East markets.
Zinke stated that the participation of Russia in a conflict in Syria, especially where it acts on the invitation of a legal government, was the reason to investigate new energy girls.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to become an Energosurs Trade Mediator, as they already do in East and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"With the US military forces can provide free passage by seaways and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy does not get into the market," he said.
Zinke was referring to the Western participants conducted by the Consumer Energy Alliance (Allians of Energosurs Consumer Energy Alliance), a non-commercial organization, which sees itself as "the voice of every consumer" in the United States.
Then he compared approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
"Economic strategy for Iran and Russia is that we're effectively using energy resources and replaceing them with alternatives," he said, calling Russia "one-way developed," because its economy depends on the energy of mineral origin.
While these claims were messed up, the Trampa administration had aimed at increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe, removing from the Russian energy market, much cheaper for the Europeans.
For this, the employees of Tramp's administration and the President Donald Tramp themselves are trying to convince the German government to quit the "insignificant" project of the construction of the Northern Flood 2, which, according to Tramp, will make Berlin a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that the Northern Flood 2 gasogen cost 11 billion dollars and that doubles the existing gasgon capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
The Kreml convinces that Washington is enthusiastic against the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share that energy resources cannot be a pressure tool and consumer should be able to select suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with the US Energy Minister Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative response to Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German leading organization of the field the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI) urged the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like the third country interfering with our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of the German Industry, after the last meeting of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusett Elizabeth Warren will seriously think about the president's post in 2020
Senator from the state of Massachusett Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that "he'll think seriously" about being president after the elections.
During a meeting with the public in Goliak, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of making her candidacy.
According to the The Hill Warren, "We have the time for women to go to Washington and set up the government's work, and for that, there should be a woman on his head."
"After November 6th, I'll seriously think of making my candidacy a president."
During the meeting with the public, Warren expressed her assessment of the Presidentship of Donald Tramp, saying that "he leads his country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was open, criticizing Tramp and proposing a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Cavano.
The Friday Twitter Warren wrote, "...usually, before the FBI votes, it's going to be an investigation."
However, according to the results of the Friday survey, most Warren voters don't think it should be chattered in 2020.
According to the results of the survey conducted jointly by the Centre for Political Research of the University of Saffolk and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the potential voters in the state of Massachusetts have spoken against the expulsion of the senator of their candidacy.
Thirty-two percent supported the exhibition.
The results of the survey showed that more support has been used by former Governor Deval Patrick.
During the discussions of other famous democrats who can qualify in 2020, they also call the former Vice-President Joe Bayden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Baiden stated that he would decide until January.
Sarah Paylin mentioned the PTSP track Paylin during the meeting on support of Donald Tramp
26-year-old Trek Paylin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military service in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence, and the incident occurred on Monday night.
"What my son is going through right now, what he's going through after return, can only understand other families who experience the consequences of PTSR and other health problems that our soldiers are coming home," she said to the participants in the meeting for support of Donald Tramp in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Paleen called Treck's arrest "the problem that no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "are not returning home as they were before, more cruel, and they want to know if they respect what their soldiers, pilots and other soldiers have done for this country."
According to the vocabulary of the police Department of Vasilla, Dan Bennett, Track was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and attacks on a woman, as well as that he was preventing the reporting of violence and carrying weapons in the state of alcoholic drunkenness.
18 states and district of Colombia support the charge of shelter policy
Eighteen states and the district of Colombia support the prosecution of the new U.S. policy, according to which the victims of gangish persecution and domestic violence are denied the status of refugee.
According to NBC News, the representatives of 18 states and the district sent analytical note from the court advisor in Washington to support a shelter that needs shelter and accused the policy mentioned in the court order.
The full name of the invitation in the "Grace Anti-Sashns" case, in charge of the American Union's Protection of Civil Rights, in which a federal policy has been complained and which was issued in August, is not revealed.
The invitationary stated that her partner and his cruel sons bands were beating her, but the US landlords refused her when she asked for shelter on July 20th.
It was illegally held in Texas.
State prosecutors, who support Grace's lawsuits, stated that the people of Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees of which often ask for refuge in the United States) often face serious problems such as gangism and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy cancels the decision of the Appeals Council on Immigration in 2014, according to which immigrants without documents fleeing from domestic violence could ask for refuge.
General Prosecutor General Carl Reisin said on Friday during his talk that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state laws, federal and international laws."
"Federal Law requires that the decision on claims for refugee status be based on the consideration of the facts and circumstances set out in this statement, and the prohibition violates this principle," says the analytical note of the court advisor.
In the analytical note, the prosecutors suggest that the policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States is harming the economy of the country, because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "complete the necessary labour resources".
In June, the Prosecutor General Jeff Seshns issued an order for immigration judges, in which it was that they could no longer give refugee status to those who flee from domestic violence and banditism.
"The asylum is given to persons who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial prosecution, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," said Seshns during the presentation of politics on June 11th.
The asylum was never intended to solve all the problems, even those serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Saviors are desperately trying to find those who have remained alive, while the number of deaths in Palu has doubled.
For those who remain alive, the situation continues to be worsened.
"The situation is very tense," says 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with fever in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
"Each minute a quick help brings the bodies.
There's no clean water."
Some inhabitants return to their ruined homes, take underweated benefits, trying to save what they found.
There are hundreds of people injured, and hospitals damaged by the earthquake, whose power was 7,5 points at Richter’s scale, are full.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris, with a break of back and shoulder, are resting at the building of the army hospital of Palu, where patients are being assisted under the open sky through constant repeated pushing.
His eyes were filled with tears when he remembered how strong the push snapped the hotel room on the fifth floor where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for rescue.
I think I'm stuck in the middle of the wreckages of the wall," said Harris to the correspondent Associated Press, adding that he and his family came to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife beg for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "producing psychological pressure" through "propaganda-containing advocacy"
A week after the Chinese state newspaper placed a advertising material on the four pages of the American daily publication on mutual benefits from trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of the use of American press to distribute propaganda.
The United States President Donald Tramp sent on Wednesday a payment supplement to China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper of the state of Iowa after the accusation of China of attempting to influence the elections to the Congress that will take place on November 6th. China rejects these accusations.
As informed by the Reuters officials in the United States, Tramp, who accuses Beijing of attempts to intervene in American elections, means a new phase of escalation by Washington, which is aimed at pressure against China.
Although foreign governments can place a commercial advertisement for marketing, there is an escalation of trade war between Beijing and Washington in time, which has already raised the duty to import.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the imposition of a repressive bribe in China was not enough to strike exporters from states like Iowa, who supported the Republican Tramp Party.
Terry Bransted, U.S. Ambassador in China, and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, stated that China has harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, as wrote Bransted in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, "builds pressure by publishing a advertising that contains propaganda in our independent press."
"To spread the propaganda, the government of China uses the road to the American people the tradition of freedom of speech and the independence of the press, placeing a pay advertisement in Des Moines Register," wrote Bransted.
"In contrast, on the street layouts here, in Beijing, you will find only individual votes of in-communists, and there you will not see the real reflection of what the Chinese people actually think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which causes anxiety, which can make the conclusion that the media of China is under a reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the most important Chinese publications offered a publication" of his article, but he didn't say which one.
Analysts warn that by failure from Cavano, the Republicans set against themselves electing women against intermediate elections.
Since many known republicans support and defend a candidate at the post of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano after he was accused of sexual harassment, analysts warn that this could cause an undesirable response before the future elections, especially in women.
The situation is around, and most republicans publicly claim that they would like to move to the vote.
These things can't just be played back," said Grant Riger, a professor of politology at Maxwell's University of Syracus during the interview.
Riger doubted that the investigation of the FBI, in which Senator Jeff Flake (Republic of Arizona) insisted in the last minute, would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the chief advisor and the speaker of the MoveOn progressive group, Catherine Jean-Perrier said on Friday, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow or in November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters sang "Listopad approaches!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move to the Candidature of Cavano, despite Dr. Christine Blaze Ford's testimony.
In an interview with the news site, Stu Rotenberg, an extraparty political viewer, said, "The people will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They say it is now, and it's true.
However, the motivation may be stronger, especially in women-electoral women of 18-29 years, from the precedents that have not yet been determined and often don't vote if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford gave a testimony to the candidate's charges to the Supreme Court of Sexual Crime, the analysts predicted the negative response of the voters if the Republicans insisted on approval.
According to NBC News, earlier this week, the former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steel, said, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As the director Priorities of the United States (U.S. Priority) in an interview in the news channel, Gai Cecil said: "The matter is not about the vote of the committee, the final vote or the fact that Cavano was on the law of the defendants, and how they responded to this situation and how they continued to act."
However, the thoughts of the Americans about whose testimony of faith, Ford or Cavano, were divided.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41 percent of the respondents believe or rather believe in Ford’s testimony, while Cavano believes or rather believes 35 percent of the respondents.
In addition, 38 percent of the surveys have noted that they believe that Cavano was giving or probably giving false testimony, while the Ford said the same thing about 30 percent of the surveyers.
According to The Guardian, after the insistence of Flake, the FBI is conducting an examination of accusations issued by Ford and another caller, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford gave a testimony under the oath of the Legal Committee of the Senate about how Cavano attacked her by being alcoholic when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez stated that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia at the party during their schooling at the Yellow University in the 1980s.
The world network inventor plans to run "new Internet" to create Google and Facebook competition
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the global Internet, starts a new startup to create Facebook, Amazon and Google competition.
The latest project of the world's technology legend, Inrupt, is developing a platform with the open source code of Solid, whose idea belongs to Berners Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and who to access the information.
In an exclusive interview, the Fast Company Berners-Lee was kidding that the purpose of the intrusion was the world rule.
'We must do it now,' he said about startup.--
It's a historic moment."
The Solid technology is used to allow users to create "personal online data storage" or "pod".
It can contain lists of contacts, lists of current matters, calendar, audio recording library, and other tools for own use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify at the same time.
The unique feature of this personal online storage of data is that it is incompletely satisfying the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "promotion of personal possibilities using data."
According to Director-General Inrupt John Bruce, the company has to engage in resources, processes and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, security platforms purchased in IBM, several staff developers hired to work on the project, and volunteers community.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee stated that he and his team did not negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether they should be fully replaced when all their business models were being changed in a short period of time.
"We don't ask for their permission."
The Saturday publication in Medium Berners-Lee states that the Inrupt company's mission is to "protect commercial energy and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the Consortion of the World Spider at the Massachusett Technology Institute.
In recent months, Berners Lee is an influenced figure in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt Berners-Lee, he remained the founder and director of the World Spider Consortion, the Web Foundation Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
"I look very optimisticly at the next era of network development," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Wann: celebrations about the dedication of the church to the Victoria Crest Order in the First World War
The only representative of the English Church who received the Order of the "Cross Victoria" for participating in battle during the First World War, is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Wann received a reward for the invasion of Belgium and Leokur on September 29, 1918.
However, he died from a sniper bullet four days later and never learned that he had received the highest military reward of Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren discovered a memorial stone during the parade in Rashden, County Northgamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Wann, called "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone happened just 100 years after his grandfather made an award, for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Wann translated his battalion through the St. Katen channel through a very dense fog and under the dense fire of field guns and guns.
Later, he hurried to the firewall, and with "desperate courage" he led a stream forward, before one broke into the field gun and destroyed three guns of the enemy unit.
Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the war ends.
72-year-old Michael Wann said his grandfather did what he would never have been able to repeat and deserve respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Wann, put a vein on parade under the head of the Brantwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wann said that "he feels very proud of being involved in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is demonstrating the respect that so many people show to him."
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206, but they showed them "Pep's pig."
Imagine that you're not sleeping all night just to watch the Bellator 206, and you're refused to see the main event.
In the tournament at San José, 13 battles were identified, including six main programs that were transmitted lively in the night of Britain at 5 channels.
At 6:00 a.m., just before Hegard Mussasi and Rory McDonald were ready to get together, the British televisioners died of a surprise when on the screen instead of the fighting showed up a Peppe pig.
Some of the viewers were not excited because they were not sleeping until the morning waiting for the fight.
One of the fans wrote in Twitter that switching to a child's painting was a "failing joke."
"In accordance with the order of the government, the content that was transmitted at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to release child transfer," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president from the marketing and communications with the Bellator public when he asked about the television,
"Pep's pig, yes."
President of the company Bellator Scott Cocker promised to work on the broadcast schedule to capture British viewers in the future.
"I think that if we're talking about a relay, we'll be able to arrange it," said Cooker.
"But now there's Sunday, 6:00 a.m., and we can't do anything until we have Sunday and they have Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages that we answered, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to remove it.
However, it turns out that it was inappropriate to government laws.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to cut the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual, and we've been trying to redirect the signal for fans, but we've been deferring these attempts.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worst" than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumping into the water tells Tom Daley that he grew worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but it motivated him to achieve success.
24-year-old athlete said he didn't understand that "not everyone like him" until he went to high school.
As participating in the release of the Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, Lauren Lavern leads, he pointed out that he openly spoke about the rights of gays to give hope to others.
He also stated that parenthood made it less to worry about the victory of the Olympic Games.
The leader who has been running this program for a long time, Kirstie Young, went to the hospital for a few months.
As a party to the first Lavern program, Daley stated that he felt "worst" than others when he was a child, because "the society didn't take it when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "To this time, the feeling of minority and difference was just what gave me strength and strength to achieve success."
He said he wanted to prove that something was worthy not to disappoint all those who finally learned about his orientation.
The two-time bronze olympics of the Olympics became a famous fighter for the rights of the LBGT community and took advantage of this year's College Games in Australia to invite more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He stated that he was openly talking about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this hope to others.
The triple world champion admitted that his feelings to a man, an American movie director, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, became a real surprise for him.
Daley married the Oscar Prize Laureate, older than him for 20 years, last year, but he said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you're going through so many things in this young age," (the first Olympic games he played when he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer, it's hard to find someone of his age, who would also survive similar tricks and falls.
In June, there was a son who was called Robert Black Daley, and since then, according to Daley, his "switch" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would only think about getting gold," he said.
"You know, there are things more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named his father Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daily said that his father could not accept the end, and before his death, he asked if they bought tickets for the London Olympics 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "you're not gonna sit in the first row because you're not next to me," said Dali.
"I held him for his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daily took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and got a bronze.
"I knew that I had dreamed about this all my life: diving in front of my neighbors at the Olympic Games, and there was no feeling better than that," said Dali.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song — Proud (Hord) in the execution of Gizer Small — which reasoned with him during preparing for the Olympic Games and still causes the ants.
Desert Island Discs exits on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 an English summer time.
On Saturday from the tournament for the Rider Cube, Mickelson was taken out of his shape.
The American Phil Michelson will set up a record on Sunday by playing his 47th game in a tournament for the "Cubek Ryder", but he has to rebuild his shape so that this event doesn't become unhappy for him.
Michelson, who took part in the 12th record tournament, which took place once for two years, led Captain Jim Furick out of the game during the float and forsams.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained on the side, hoping to overcome emotions.
Since Michelson wasn't famous for the proper strikes of his career, 48-year-old athlete was not exactly fit for a complex golf field for Le Golf National, where the raff usually punishes for wandering.
And if the field is not that obstacle, on the ninth match on Sunday, Michelson will have to meet the champion of the Open Champion and the master of the exact hit of Francesco Molinari, who won all his match this week.
If the Americans who stand by three points after 12 single matches start well, Michelson's match can be decisive.
Furrick expressed confidence in his sportsman, and he probably had nothing to add to it.
"He fully understood his role today, scratched me in his back, hugged me, and said that tomorrow he would be ready," said Furick.
"He has no doubt his powers.
Michelson is a member of the Fame Hall, who has done so much for the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two matches.
I predicted more matches, but it worked out, and so we decided to do this.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anyone else."
If Michelson gets on the field on Saturday, he'll beat Nick Faldo's record, who played the biggest games in the Rider Cook.
And that's where he might end his career in the Rider Coubock tournament, which never matched his individual achievements.
On Michelson’s account, 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven night results, but Furrick said that his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
"He's funny, he's delicious, he likes to joke with others, he's a guy who's great to have in the team," explained Furick.
"I think the younger players had fun, raising at him and this week, and it was interesting to observe.
He's more than just a player."
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that the great breakdown is not a solution.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the lonely rival tournament in the last day of the "Cubek Ryder" doesn't guarantee victory.
The Danish debated in 1997 at the Walderram Club field, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros was ahead of the Americans at five points, but it won the game with a small breakdown with the result of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in the Walderham field; a big break in the Brooklyn where we lost, and in the Walderham field where we won violence," Bjorn said after watching the victory games of Class 2018 with the result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break was 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing has yet been resolved.
Tomorrow we have to play with the maximum rate.
Go to the field and do everything necessary.
The game will be completed only after the result comes on the table.
We have a goal to get this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I'm focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we're aware of the best players in the world."
He was pleased with his players in a complex field, and Bjorn added, "I'll never run ahead.
Tomorrow things can work differently.
Tomorrow, individual matches are waiting for us, and this is something else.
It's good to play on the field with a partner when everything goes well, but it's just when you're standing there alone, and you can check what you're worth as a golfist.
This is how you need to configure the players to speak tomorrow: at the border of the possibilities.
You leave your partner without support, and now he also has to show what he's capable of."
Unlike Biorne, the opposite number Jim Furick expects his partners to play a better game at the individual level, except for Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who took three points from four.
By the last day, Furrick's destiny was returned by different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was defeated when the team from Europe created "The Wonder in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the command captain of 1999, organized the players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone’s side, the players in the middle of the distance experience special pressure.
We put the team players in a proper way, like we're going to do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the top-mache against Rory Macilroy, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half of the European team.
"There are these partners, and in this order, I have chosen because I want to equally distribute efforts during the whole game," Bjorn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
A new German battleship has been deferred
The contemporary fregat of the German military fleet was to take action in 2014, instead of the old warships of the Cold Wartimes. However, for local media information, this will not happen until the next year because of the disagreement systems and the immediate growth of expenditure.
According to Die Zeit, a vocabulary of military recruitment, the introduction of the Reinland-Pfaltz ship, the main ship of the most contemporary fregates of the Class Baden-Vurtemberg class, was deferred to the first half of 2019.
This ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that occurred after the delivery had damaged the implementation of the ambition project.
Four ships of the Baden-Vurtemberg class, which the seamen ordered in 2007, are to replace the old fregates of the Breman class.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful weapon, a set of aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some of the technologies of reducing sensitivity, such as radiolocation, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of technical security, and new fregates are expected to be able to avoid returning to the basement port for about two years.
However, journalists of Die Zeit warn that, due to the continuous delays, overtime warships that would strengthen the military power of Germany in the sea, will also exploit.
The F125 multi-patient fregat was in the titles of the newspaper last year when the German military forces officially refused to put the ship into action and returned it to Blohm + Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first case of returning the military ship to a ship building company after delivery.
The reasons for return were not known, but the German media mentioned significant "software and equipment defects", which caused the battleship to become inappropriate to carry out military operations.
Software deficiencies are particularly important, because the Baden-Vurtemberg ship crew consists of about 120 sailors -- it's only half of the number of troops who served on the old fregates of the Bremen class.
Furthermore, it turns out that the ship has a considerable excess of weight, which deteriorates its exploitative characteristics and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
It is considered that the Reinland-Pphalz fregate is double (7000 tonnes) for ships of the same class that were used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the incorrect equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of the preparation of the crew.
The estimated 2.2 billion euros were turned into a massive 3.1 billion euro (U.S. $3.6 billion).
The problems with receiving new fregates have acquired special weight in the light of recent warnings about the decline in Germany's military and maritime forces.
At the beginning of the year, Bundestagu's authorized for armed forces Hans-Peter Bartels reported that in the MS of the country "are few ships suitable for combat tasks."
The official stated that the situation had been rapidly deteriorated for a period of time, since the old ships were exploited and the new were not coming.
He expressed deep regret that none of the fregates of the Baden-Vurthamberg class could fill the marine fleet.
The National Trast will Observe the Secret Life of Battles
A new research conducted in the field of landowning in the Scotland Mountain is intended to establish how bats use landscapes to search for food.
Scientists hope that the data received will help light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take action from their preservation in the future.
In the gardens of Invery in West Ross, Scientists of the Scotland National Trail will be watching such types as the netopy of corn and pigmei netopy, and the drill of the ordinary and aquatic nightcare.
Special registrators will be placed in strategic places in land ownership to observe the behaviour of batches during the season.
Workers and volunteers of the Scotland National Trail will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and screaming of batches.
Then it is planned to develop a detailed map of living animals and prepare a report to link the behaviour of animals to the environment of their lives.
Rob Duar, a Natural Protection Adviser in the Scotland National Trail, hopes that the results of the research will help to determine which areas of living are the most important and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to evaluate the effectiveness of the environmental care (e.g. forming lions) and identify optimum forest saving methods for bats and other related species.
During the last century, the population of battoons has significantly decreased in Scotland and in the territory of Britain.
They are threatened by active construction and conquering territories, depriving their nest sites.
Other negative factors include wind installation and lighting, a sticky paper for flies, chemical construction materials, as well as house cat attacks.
Speakers are not actually blind.
However, because of the hunting at night, ears help them to catch more effectively than their eyes.
They use a complex echolocation methodology to identify insects and obstacles to flight routes.
In Scotland’s National Trast, which carries for over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance and 76,000 acres of the earth throughout the country, are seriously treated with the problems of bats.
Ten specially trained experts are conducting regular research, estate checks, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The efforts of the organization were even created in Scotland by the first and the only reservation for bats, which is located in the Triv area in the Damfris and Gallowey area, where eight of the ten species of bats live in Scotland.
David Thompson's headquarters claims that this is the perfect place for them.
"In the place of the Triv's territories, great conditions for batches," he assures.
"There are old buildings, many huge trees and other favourable living conditions.
But we need a lot more to learn about the bats, and through the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we'll be able to learn more about what they need to make good."
He insists that it is very important to check the area for batches before carrying out any technical work, because by unintended destruction of one nest site for the release of a young man, 400 female females may be killed, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
They are protected by law and are prohibited from killing, torturing or disturbing animals.
Elizabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scotland Centre for Battlekeeping, encouraged the public to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We need a lot more to learn about our bats, we have not yet revealed the characteristics of many species."
Ronald rejects charges of rape, and his lawyers are preparing a suit against German publication
Cristian Ronald called the accusation of raping "collapse" and claimed that people "are trying to draw attention to themselves," using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a complaint against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published suspicion information.
Catherine Mayorga's American accused the Forward of the Collective Portugal and the Euventus Football Club of Violence, which happened in 2009 in the hotel room in Las Vegas.
As the Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday, Ronald seemed to have paid her 375,000 dollars for silence.
A few hours after the prosecution of 33-year-old Ronald turned to 142 million of his fans in the Instagram video transmission, named the corresponding message "convenience".
"No, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are a slander," that's what the five-fold master of the Gold Ball made on the camera.
"They want to draw attention to themselves using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to gain from me, but these situations are part of my work.
I'm a happy person and I'm fine," he added, smiling.
According to the Reuters Information Agency, Ronald's lawyers are preparing a suit against Der Spiegel for the prosecutions they've called "unsuspicious suspicion in the field of private life".
Christian Sherc's attorney claimed that the football player would require compensation for "moral damage in size, which corresponds to the seriousness of a violation, which is probably one of the most loud cases of personal rights violations in recent years".
It's alleged that the incident was held in the Palms Casino hotel in Las Vegas in June 2009.
It is reported that after the meeting at the night club of Ronald and Mayorga returned to the player’s room, where he seemed to have been raped by an analogue rape, such a testimony was transferred to the district court of Clark, Nevada.
Majorga claims that after Ronald's described incident, he fell on her knees and said he was a "99 percent good guy" whom he'd betrayed "one percent."
As indicated in the papers, Ronald confirmed that he had sex with a model, but on both consents.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and then to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later, she agreed to the outdoor reconciliation, because she was afraid of revenge and she was guarded of "public humiliation".
Now, a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel the previous arrangement because she continues to suffer from an incident that she said had happened.
At the time of the event that was marked, Ronald was preparing for the FC Real Madrid from the FC Manchester United, and this summer he became the player of the Italian football, the Euventus team, for 100m euros.
Brexit: Great Britain will "forever regret" the loss of autoproducers
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses the status of a world leader in the field of autoproduction after Brexit, warning of that from the Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He added that he was excited by the statement of the representatives of Toyota UK who informed BBC journalists that in the event of the exit of Britain from the EU without an agreement, the company would be forced to suspend the production and work of its factory in Bernastone, near Derby.
"We need a treaty," Minister Clark assures.
The Japanese autoproducer stated that the effects of delays on the border in the case of Brexit without an agreement could cost jobs.
In Bernaston, the Toyota models of Auris and Avensis produced some 150,000 cars, 90 percent exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain excessively leaves the EU at the end of March, the production in our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, Director-General of Toyota in Bernastone.
Other autoproducers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain's exit from the EU without an international trade agreement.
For example, BMW said that the Mini model factory in Oxford would be closed in a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of autoproducers are that Brexit without an agreement can cause risks for supply chains.
Toyota’s production line operates in the operational supply of details and materials according to the needs — details come every 37 minutes from British and EU suppliers for vehicles produced for orders.
If the EU leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be breakdowns in the supplies of details that will result in delays and lack of materials.
According to the company, the Toyota store can be placed in detail for no more than one day, so the production will have to stop.
Greg Clark pointed out that the EU's organization of relations prepared by Teresa May (Chequers Plan), "except the schemes for avoiding problems on the border."
"We need a deal, we need a optimum agreement, which, I think, will allow us not only to achieve success at the moment but also to use the prospects that have come," he said during today's BBC Radio 4.
"Because of the testimony of the representatives of the Toyota company and other autoproducers, we need to preserve the high-effective supply chains."
The Toyota company was unable to tell how long the production will be stopped, but in a long-term perspective, it is expected that an increase in the cost will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and will result in reducing jobs.
Peter Zevalaris, the head of the Unite Professional Communities, in Bernastone, who worked here for 24 years, said that other participants are extremely concerned, "I can say from experience, the short jobs are not renewed."
The government representative said, "We have set up a precise and reliable plan to form our future relations with the EU."
Tramp and Rosenstein’s meeting can be relocated, noted in the White House
As the representatives of the White House reported on Sunday, the responsible meeting of Donald Tramp with the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "revocation for another week" while discussions on the expulsion of the candidate of Brett Cavano to the Supreme Court of Justice.
Rosenstein controls the work of a special prosecutor Robert Muller, investigating Russia's intervention in the election, the link between Tramp and Russia and the potential obstacle to justice by the President.
During a few months in Washington, there is a discussion of the probability of exemption of a prosecutor of the General Prosecutor, threatening Muller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein said about the use of microphones to record talks with Tramp and the possibility of the president's overstanding powers by 25th amendment.
Rosenstein didn't confirm this information.
But last Monday, he visited the White House on the background of reports that the official was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Tramp, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was appointed on Thursday.
Tramp stated that "I wouldn't want to" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence in time with the meeting of the Senate Legal Committee, at which Cavano and one of the women were going to testify, who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday, Tramp ordered a weekly FBI investigation for charges against Cavano, which further delayed the voting in the Senate.
Press Secretary Tramp, Sarah Sanders, performed at the Fox News Sunday TV show.
When she asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not scheduled, maybe it's going to happen this week, and I expect it to be postponed for another week, in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I'm keeping an eye on the press's last information."
Some journalists disagreed with this: Sanders did not make briefings for the media in the White House of September 10th.
The leading Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the frequent briefings weren't related to the hostility of the public's television reporters, although she added, "I won't deny that they're playing public."
Then she assumed that Tramp himself would communicate with the press more.
"The president answers questions more often than any president to him," she added, without referring to the source, "Statistics speak for itself."
Sanders noted that the briefings would still be held, but "if the press is able to ask the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We're trying to communicate often with the press, which should be particularly visible over the last few weeks, and the possibility of talking to the President of the United States is not worse than the press conference."
Tramp regularly answers the questions during action outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences for the participation of high guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why it was so, acting openly and sometimes incredibly before journalists.
The State Health Secretary of Scotland addressed the letter to EU workers in connection with the concerns through Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health addressed the letter to other EU citizens who work in the Scotland National Health Service to express their appreciation for their work and ask them to continue after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, a member of the Scotland parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the exit of Britain from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the value of claims for receiving a permanent displacement status for EU citizens working in autonomous government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman noted, "The talks between Britain and the EU on the issue of the exit have continued during the summer.
But the British government strengthens preparing for possible exit without an agreement.
I know that this period may be very anxious for you.
That's why I would like to emphasize again how I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all the European Union and countries outside it share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving the health service for patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay."
Cristion Ebercrombi passed an emergency surgery after a head trauma
The Senior Protector of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Ebercromby, carried out an emergency surgery after a head trauma in the Sunday game against Vanderbilt Commodores, which his team lost with account 31:27.
The chief trainer of Tennessee State Tigers told the reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He approached the sideline where he was sick," said Reid.
On the side line, coaches and medical personnel gave Ebercrombi oxygen before weapons were taken to conduct further surveys.
The Tannessee State Tigers official informed Chris Harris from the WSMV channel, Nashville, Tennessee, that Ebercromby was operated at the University of Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that "not yet testimony of type and severity of trauma," at Tennessee State Tigers, they're trying to find out when the player got injured.
Ebercromby, a second-classman, spent his first season in Tennessee State Tygers after the shift from the Illinois team.
He took five ball captures on Sunday before he got out of the game, so he's got 18 captures in the season.

This step can be considered as an attempt to neutralize the efforts of Jeremy Corbin to involve young voters in promises to provide a more accessible home for high - paid employees.
The increase in customs will apply to physical and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain.
Further bribes accompanied by an increase in the courtyard’s age to the second residence and real rental property may be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to include additional 120 million pounds per year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate that is built in London is owned by foreign citizens, which leads to a higher price and complicating the task of those who only dream about their own home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, are emptied because a large number of foreign buyers live mostly outside the country.
A new plan of action appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state bribe to make the apartment more available for young people.
He accused large construction companies of supporting high prices of immunity by buying the land without further use.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of important real estate reforms, including rental control and failure to expulsion without reason.
He also suggests that local councils in the area of building a new housing.
Teresa May said, "I promised last year that I would devote my prime ministership to the renewal of the British dream -- for every new generation of life should be better.
This requires changes in our imperfect housing market.
Britain will always remain open to those who want to live, work and build their future here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in Britain and foreign companies buy accommodation under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many, the dream of their own home has become unattainable, and the problem of living under the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "After all I want to be the chief coach of Collective Scotland."
Jack Ross, chief coach of the Sanderland FC, says that "more than anything he wants" would ever lead the Scotland College.
The 42-year-old Scotch started to restore the north-east club of the country, which is now sitting the third place in the First Football League, three points away from the leader.
Ross moved to the Station of Light this summer, returning the last season of St. Mirren to the Prime Minister of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to the second collective Scotland, but that's the end of it," said Ross during the Sportsound program at the BBC Scotland radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of the Collective Scotland at the Hampden Park Stadium, which always attracted me.
The only hope for me is to be successful at the leading coach of the club."
Ross' prevailers in the Sanderland FC, including Dick Lawyer, David Mys, Sam Ellardays, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kin, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Kanio.
Former coach of the Alloa Athletic FC claims that he didn't feel excited about going to the big club following such authorized names, previously rejecting the proposals from the FC of Barnsley and Ipswick Town.
"In the current stage, I'll think it's successful if the club returns to the Prime Minister of League.
Thanks to its structure and the material and technical security, this club is undoubtedly equal to the Prime Minister of League," he said.
"It's going to be a difficult task, but another result I'm hardly gonna think it's a success for myself."
Ross only built a training career for three years before he was a second trainer in the FC Dumbarton, and he spent 15 months in the FC's coach headquarters.
Then he helped Alloa recover after the FC reached the third division, and the next season from St. Merren went the way from the flying stage to gain the title of the winners of the first division.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his game career at the FC Clyde, Gartlpool, Folkers, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academycal.
"I'm on the trip," he recalls, talking about the transition to the FC "Alloa."
"I sincerely believed that training was more suitable to me than a game.
That sounds strange because I was successful, well earned and reached certain heights.
But it's hard to play.
There are many difficulties to deal with each week.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as a chief coach, I feel at my place.
I've always been interested in the training work, and I've never felt so comfortable for my adult life as I have chosen this profession."

Study: 17:30 Sunday - ideal time for a beer bowl
The summer heat has helped to increase the benefit of British pubs who are not in the best times, but to increase the pressure on the restaurants’ networks.
According to the sales calculations in pubs and bars in July, 2.7% increased, while the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, author of the CGA organization for business development, noted: "With solar weather and longer than expected, the participation of England in the World Championship, July went through the same scheme as the previous month when the pub delivery grew by 2.8%, and the restaurants went even worse.
The red fall by 1.8% in July increased.
Pabs and bars oriented on drinks, while they have the best rates — their profit growth is equal to the loss of restaurants.
The pubs with food also suffered from heat, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like the visitors are only interested in drinking.
In controlling pubs and bars of drinks, it increased by 6.6% per month, while the sale of food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst of a free and hotel business in RSM, said, "We see similar trends from the end of April.
Weather and widespread social or sports events remain the main factors that affect the sale of the internal market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to lose their profits.
The long hot summer has not come at the best time for food plants, and we'll see if the more moderate temperature we've seen in August can give them such a rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, was 2.7% in July, which reflects the slowdown of the market of new brands.
The gallose indicator of the sales of Coffer Peach Tracker in the pubs, bars and restaurants of Britain is the reflection of the collected and analysed productivity rates of 47 working groups, the total traffic circulation exceeds 9 billion pounds of sterlings, which is a generally accepted branch standard.
Every fifth child has a social network account hidden from parents
The results of the research showed that every five child, sometimes aged 11 years old, has an account hidden from parents and teachers in social networks.
A study covering 20,000 students of high school showed an increase in the number of fictional pages in Instagram
This news strengthened concerns about the possible placement of sexual nature
20% of the students reported that they had a "base account" showing to their parents
Every fifth child, sometimes aged 11 years old, creates an account in social networks that hides from adults.
A study covering 20,000 students of high school showed an increase in the number of fictional pages in Instagram, a social network for photo exchanges.
This news strengthened concerns about the possible placement of sexual nature.
20% of the students reported that they had a clean "base" account that showed to their parents, and one or more private accounts.
The mother, who ran into the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw the invitation to rape me there.
A study conducted by the organizations Digital Awareness of the UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles in social networks. Half of these children recognized that the additional account is secret.
The head of the HMC Association, Mike Buchanan, said, "We are very concerned that many teenagers feel the desire to create an online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Alyd Doyle will become "Athletic interests" at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Alyd Doyle was elected in the Scottish Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual general government meetings.
Doyle is the founded scotland leaflet, and the head of the Yen Beatty Council said that this is an excellent opportunity for those leading the sports movement to use its broad experience gained at the international level over the last decade.
"Aleid is using great respect among Scotland, British and world athletes, and we are convinced that when she joins the council, the sports in Scotland will be of great benefit," Beatti assured.
Doyle said, "I'll be inspired as an athlete representative, and I hope I can really benefit and promote sports in Scotland."
The American, a four - time olympic champion who won a race of 200 and 400 meters in the games of 1996 in Atlanta, and now, the Sports Browser for BBC, lost the possibility of walking through a transitory ishemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "I had a stroke for a month.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors claimed that only time would show if I could recover and how much.
I learned how to walk, and today I am doing dynamic exercises!
Thank you for the words of support!"
In the advertising of women's milk smoker compared to cows, the ideas of the Internet users were divided
The manufacturer of milk suckers faced an uncertain reaction of Internet users to a advertisement in which young mothers compared to real cows.
In order to note the release of the product called the first silent milk smoker in the world, the Technology Manufacturer of Consumer Products Elvie produced a advertising in a humoristic music video to show the freedom that the mothers provide a new smoker.
Four real mothers dance in a song filled with a shadow, which contains the following words: "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have my tail" and "As you see, it's not a wash, it's my chest."
The choir sings: "Smoke, smoke to feed the children, smoke, smoke, smoke, so that you can't waste milk."
However, the advertising video published on Facebook’s website caused a violent discussion online.
The video has obtained 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the reaction of the Internet users has been uncertain, and many have noted that the advertising is underestimated by the "worst organisation" of milk production in the industry.
"It's not a very clever decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and be born to give milk, but their children are being taken from them a few days after their birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie's milk-smoker can be easily hidden in a feeding bullet (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment, "It's obviously traumatically both for the mother and the child.
But why not incorporate them to advertise the milk smoker for women who need to feed their babies?"
Another one added, "This advertisement is very far from reality."
Other users have been defending the advertising video, and one of the women's videos has seemed "very cheerful."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would certainly have bought this if I were still feeding her breasts.
When I smoked milk, I felt really like a cow.
The advertisement was kind of crazy, but I didn't look for a secret sense in it.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "Common advertisement, oriented on mammy, which sucks milk (optionally in work or in the bathroom) and feels like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at enlightening breast industry's advantages and shortages."
At the end of the video, women show milk smokers hidden in their bullets.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
Elvie, however, works completely quietly, has no wires or pipes and is easily hiding in a feeding bullet.
Anne Balarin, a partner and an executive creative director of Mother's advertising agency, commented, "The Elvie smoker is so revolutionary that he demanded a bright and provocative presentation.
After doing a parallel between women who squeeze milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the characteristics of breast production, in an exciting and interesting way by demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that a new smoker will bring.
Elvie's smoker is not the first time in the news heads.
In London's Week of Fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the scene with this product during showing clothes from Martha Jacobian modeler.
Thousands of migrant children moved quietly to the tent city on the Texas border
The number of immigrants detained has grown sharply, although the number of monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because the cruel rhetoric and politics of the Tramp Administration have complicated the disposal of children to careers.
Traditionally, in most cases, carers were immigrants themselves without documents, and now they are afraid to put their own chance to stay in the country by offering responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential care providers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to print fingerprints and that these data would be transferred to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, High Officer of the Bureau for Immigration and Customs Control, testified before the Congress that the Bureau’s workers arrested dozens of people who supplied the care of minors without accompaniement.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no criminal history.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are carers or members of their household are illegally in the country, many of them are aliens who have committed offences.
So we continue to persecute these people," said Mr. Albens.
According to the shelter workers, in order to consider the children's affairs faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month after the detention, not in 60 days as they were before.
Many of them will be able to use a video conference, not to come to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to receive a shelter will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and official data from responsible officials in the past months, the longer the children remain under custody, the more likely they will feel anxiety or depression.
Protectors claim that these problems are increasingly enhancing in larger establishments, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the child’s psychological condition.
They added that by moving the children into the tent city and not giving enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends, we risk increasing the injury that many of them have already suffered.
Syria ordered the United States, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw troops
Also, speaking to the UN General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Valid Al Mualem, urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been in war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also works as Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were in Syrian land illegally under the cause of combating terrorism, so "to put them in place."
"They must leave immediately and not put the terms," he said at the Assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is actually finished" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, and millions left their homes.
He stated that Damascus would continue "this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "be some illegal foreign presence."
The United States has placed about 2,000 troops in Syria, and they mainly teach and consult the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are acting against President Basar al-Asad.
More than 1,000 soldiers have been sent to a desolated country by France.
With regard to refugees, Mualem assured that the country had created proper conditions for their return, and he also accused some Western countries that they "proliferated unreasonable fears" that the refugees did not dare to return.
"We encouraged international society and humanitarian organizations to help people return," he said.
"We're seeing the efforts to politicize a very humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that they will not assist Syria in renewing the country until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition of the cessation of war is established.
The United Nations diplomats reported that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last large pay of the rebels, had created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian and Turkish covenant has made it possible to prevent the massive attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia from a province of three million people.
However, Mualem emphasized that the covenant has "tough terms" and hoped that military action would be directed against dżihadists, including fighters associated with Al-Qaid Front an-Nousra, who "will be destroyed".
The U.S.E. Staffan de Missoura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, in which government and opposition will enter in to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem stated the terms for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that his work should be limited to the "review of articles of the proper constitution", and warned of intervention.
Why Trampa will be reorganized
According to this logic, Tramp can be revoluted in 2020, if many liberal viewers are likely expected, he will not be authorized in advance after scandal and impeachment.
No doubt it would be the "the dramatic ending of the presidentship all the time"!
At the moment, the viewers do not give signs of tiredness.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the Prime Time has doubled (up to 1.05 million) on the CNN channel and has actually tripled (to 1.6 million) on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nilsen, the Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in the Prime Time, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel ended up at the top of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news was discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our understanding," said Neal Ber, the executive producer of the Drama "The last candidate" on the ABC channel on a state secretary who becomes president after the attack on Capitolia.
Nell Scowell, a experienced humanist writer, and a author of the book "Are only fun moments: and a few strict truths about the invasion of Hollywood men" offers a different theory.
She remembered the journey to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that he would vote for Tramp.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's laughing at me," he said, "it's the story that Mrs. Scowell told me.
Chaos is having fun.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington are able to determine the future of Row v. Wade, the possibility of reunion of families of immigrants and the state of the world economy.
The disposal is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you're watching a group of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward "a well-known" sources for your book "Scare," Paul Manafort's jacket from the struss skin of $15,000, so it was written in the Washington Post, and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Tramp's anatomy published by Stormy Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be former again.
"The sense of reality show is partly linked to the fact that you are consented with something new every night," said Brant Montgomery, the chief Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the author of the "Lombard Stars", about the rotation in the actress store, and the daily turns in the Tramp show (conflict with NFL, the support of Kim Chan Ina).

When this week I met Mr. Flace in his house on the north coast of the island of Kawai, there was a warm sun weather (27 degrees at Celsius), but he was sitting at home looking at MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn’t get away from the TV — not when Brett Cavano stood before the Legal Committee of the Senate, but the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on his hair.
"I remember how we used to make all those crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the west civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but I guess they were right."

External influxing of funds into the most violent elections to the Congress
It is not surprising that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania there are additional money inflammation, since two electoral congressmen are racing for one chair through the borders of the electoral districts.
In the fight for this precinct of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been modified, a democrat member of the Palace of Connor Lemb, who won the other district at the additional elections last spring.
Lemb stands against another active congressman, the Republican of Kit Rothfs, which is now representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are significantly matching the new 17th.
The maps were reconstructed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January adopted the decision that the old borders of the regions were designed for the benefit of the Republicans despite the constitution.
The pre-electoral race in the new 17th district caused a strong opposition between the financial divisions of the main parties, the United States Democratic Party Committee for Congress elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lamba's name has become very famous in Pennsylvania after the winning of the 18th district with a minimum advantage during the additional elections in the Congress in March, which used wide attention to the public.
This place belonged to the Republicans over a decade, and President Donald Tramp won this county with 20 points.
Political experts have given little advantage to democrats.
In the United States, Salvador’s penalty was considered for support of China, but they changed their minds
The diplomats reminded of a weak resistance by Washington to the Dominican Republic and Panama, who had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Tramp held a warm meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Barrell, and before Tramp had a hotel in Panama, until the partners rented staff from there by the Trump Organization.
The officials of the State Department decided to revoke US diplomatic mission leaders from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama through "recent decisions on the failure of Taiwan", said the press secretary of the Department of Heather Noyert at the beginning of this month.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, who received about $140 million of US aid in 2017, such as drug control, and social and economic support.
Suggested fines that predicted a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions would be painful for this country of Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
As a result of the internal meetings, landlords from North and Central America postponed a conference at a high level devoted to security and economic prosperity.
But by mid-September, the high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and in fact, the question of sanctions against Salvador stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pens is now planning to speak at a conference appointed in mid-October, in a sign that the administration considers this interest very important.
Three American messengers were quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic because there were no new hard messages or punishments by Washington.
The representative of Mr. Bolton in the White House refused to comment on the details of the interior discussions reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, under the conditions of anonymity.
The information they provided was confirmed by a foreign analyst close to the administration that also spoke under anonymity conditions.
Study History
The report of the Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on the possible obstacle to the justice of Tramp, which is a strong confirmation of why we can find in the public information available now.
It is reported that in his investigation, Mueller is checking the possible link between Tramp's campaign and the attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the impact in the Congress goes into other ways, Tramp will have to report to the congressmen as well as to the voters and, eventually, to the one - participants.
In this case, a lot of "if," and I don't want to say that the Tramp fall is inevitable as well as his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine the length of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were willing to set up a state turn against Hitler if only the West began to resist him and supported Czechoslovakia in München.
We failed and lost the possibility of avoiding bloodshed.
The history move is determined by such a breakthrough, and the uninterrupted movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing.
The Americans are waiting for a few of these moments.
What are we gonna do if Tramp releases the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the person that depends on Mr. Muller's fate?
Rosenstein got in trouble since this newspaper came up with information that he offered a secret recording conversation with the president last year and sharing thoughts about the incompatibility of the Tramp position.
Rosenstein called the information in the The Times incorrect.
"How do we react if the investigation against Brett Cavano, which recently started by the FBI, turns out not enough careful or honest or if Cavano candidate for post in the Supreme Court, despite persuasive accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And first of all, will we in the mid-term perspective vote in favour of those members of the Congress that will be able to draw on Tramp's responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy will be evil times.
But I believe we won't be disappointed because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech - Slovak Jewish woman deported in Auschwitz the same Nazi regime as my Ambassador once.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the sabbath candles on the swastique table.

Gram Dorrance from Rangers with optimism awaits Vienna Rapid.
The FC Rangers takes Rapid on Thursday, after a thrilling night in Spain in a game with Williamreal at the beginning of this month, winning the Austrians will provide the Scotland Club with good chances to get out of the G League of Europe.
Because of the knee trauma, the semi-protector Gramm Dorrans was able to play for the first time in the season only at the game with Williamreal, which ended up with account 2:2.
"For us, this was a good result, because "Williareal" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went to the game with hope to get something and we got one point.
Maybe at the end of the game, we could go ahead, but the general thing is probably a fair result.
In the first time, the opponent was better, but after the break, we fixed the situation for our benefit.
On Thursday, there will be another important resistance in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be difficult, and our future rivals have shown good results in our last game, but we can count on supporting the sicklers, and I'm sure we can give a fight and get a positive result.
Last year, it was definitely difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with changes in the club itself, but now the situation has been normalized.
We have a great warehouse, and all the boys are happy.
I hope we can go on, leave behind the past season and achieve success."
Women lose their sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Although the surveyers had a clear concept of how they would like to organize care for themselves, few people talked about it with their family.
Some half of the people involved in the research of the Nationwide said that they were talking to their husband or wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent of the respondents talked about it with children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't hurry to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide Insurance Unit.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: Your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care if you don’t tell your wishes to your relatives in advance.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to get care, because this choice can be an important factor in determining the value.
Include a financial consultant: He can advise how to cover the costs.
The sources of long - term financing include traditional insurance policy, hybrid life insurance, or self - insurance (conditions that you have money).
Prepare the legal documents carefully: This will enable you to avoid legal tire in advance.
Prepare confidence for your representative who will control your health care and ensure that experts fulfill your wishes if you can’t do so personally.
Furthermore, we recommend that we provide confidence in ordering money.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay accounts if you are incompatible.

In Ilfracum, a man fired a few times from a pneumatic rifle
A man fired a few times when he returned home from the party.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracum, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, his stomach and his hand.
The officers described the shooting that took place at 2:30 at the British summer time as "unspecific".
The patient didn't see the attacker.
His wounds are not a threat to life, but the police are searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, reports government authorities, but the number of victims may grow.
Because of the exit of the communications system, officials dealing with humanitarian assistance can't get any information from the Dongal regent, the northern region of Palo, which is closer to the epicentre of the magnetic earthquake, at 7.5 points.
After a natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated.
Consider some of the basic facts of the city of Palu in Sulaves and the Dongal Regency.
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulaveza province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulavezi, with the oriental population of 379 800 people, according to 2017.
When the earthquake was caused by tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th year.
Dongala is a regent, which extends more than 300 miles (180 miles) along the coast line in the northwest of Sulavezi.
According to the 2017 regency, the administrative region located at the bottom of the province is about 299 200.
Fishing and agriculture are the main areas of the province of Central Sulavesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
The niquel extract is also important in the province, but mainly focused in Morowa, on the opposite coast of Sulaves.
According to the Indonesian agency on the mitigation of the effects of natural disasters in the past 100 years, Palu and Dongal suffered from tsunami several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people died as a result of tsunami in Dongal and hundreds of houses were destroyed.
In 1996, tsunami also covered the west part of Dongal, and then nine people died.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active Pacific firering ring and is regularly suffering from earthquakes.
There are several of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in the past years.
2004: December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Acheg, located in the north of Sumatra, caused tsunami, which hit 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people in the Indian coast of the Acheg province.
2005: At the end of March at the beginning of April, a series of powerful earthquakes crashed on the west coast of Sumatra.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The magnitude of 6,8 scores slipped south of Java, the most inhabited island of Indonesia, and caused tsunami that crashed on the southern coast, resulting in some 700 deaths.
2009: Near the town of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province, found an earthquake at 7.6 points.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnetous earthquake of 7,5 points slipped down one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, and caused tsunamis to a height of 10 meters, which resulted in decades of villages destroyed and killed about 300 people.
2016: The weak earthquake has struck the regency of Podjaya in the province of Acheg, causing destruction and panic that people have not yet forgotten the destructive earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the fractures of buildings.
2018: Severous earthquakes have struck into the Lomboc Island in Indonesia, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many houses, and thousands of tourists could not leave the island immediately.

He's also accused of the offences of class B, which is punished by the day of prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time against Paylin, criminal charges have been raised.
In December 2017 he was charged with an attack on his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Palene, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is now on the Court of Veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, as well as that he prevented the reporting of domestic violence and carrying weapons in the state of alcoholic drunkenness when this incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Paylin was exposed to the veteran groups for justifying her son’s violent post - traumatic stress disorder after Iraq’s service.
In Indonesia, the earthquake caused tsunami: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulaves on Friday.
The earthquake in the magnitude of 7,5 points caused tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The communications and electricity networks are out of the line, and the number of victims can rise in the next days.
The earthquake took place near the center of Sulavezi, located in the northeast of the capital of Indonesia of Jacarda.
The video spreading in social networks shows the moment when the nature hits.
Thousands of people gathered to a festival on the beach of Palu, when tsunami crashed on the shore.
Federal Prosecutors require a rare death penalty for a suspect in New York terrorist.
In New York, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Saifullo Saipov, suspected of the New York terrorism, resulting in the death of eight people — a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crime since 1953.
It is said that in October 30-year-old Sayipew, a driver rented in Home Depot pickup, traveled on a bike road along the West Side, in the Lower Manhattan, and began to beat bikes and footmen who were on his way.
According to the report on the intention to be executed in the Southern County of New York in order to reason the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Sayipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries.
According to judicial materials, each of these charges provides for the possibility of death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Justice filed a 22-point charge to Saipov, including eight accusations of murder for the purpose of demand, which the federal prosecutors are generally prosecuting in matters related to organised crime, as well as the accusations of violence and the destruction of the vehicle.
According to prosecutors who described the crime committed by Sayip as "awful, cruel, and incredible," this attack is the result of "decisive planning and pre-consumed intention".
The victims that Saipulah Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, caused or killed, were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Anne-Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferruci, Ernan Diego Mendos and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko, as described in the report of the purpose.
Five dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern County of New York was last violated by a criminal case punished by the death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug suppliers, and finally sentenced to eternal prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty for a federal case was executed in New York in 1953, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberges were executed after being sentenced for conspiracy for spying on the benefit of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 1953.
According to the case materials of Saipov, the birthman of Uzbekistan did not show the condemnation of the conscience in the next days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said to the investigator that he did not regret what he did.
According to the accusing act, Saipov informed the authorities that he was inspired to perform the video attacks he was watching on his phone.
The police reported that he also asked to hang the IDIL flag in his hospital room.
He didn't recognize himself guilty of a 22 - point accusation.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "very disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to pursue a death penalty rather than accept the confession of guilt and sentence forever prison without the possibility of release, will only increase the psychological injury caused by these events," said Patton.
Similarly, the Saipov Protection Party also asked the prosecutors not to pursue death penalty.
The parliamentary representative of the Conservative Party believes that the NAYGELA FARADJA needs to be appointed responsible for negotiations on Brexit
Today, during the protest at the Conservative Party's meeting, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the People's Army.
The former leader of the United Kingdom's Party of Independence said that politicians should "feel pressure" of eurosceptics, since one of the parliamentary representatives of Teresa Mae offered their candidature for negotiations with the EU.
The Deputy of the Conservative Party, Peter Bone, stated to march in Birmingham, that the United Kingdom would have "will come out" if Mr. Farage was the Secretary of Brexit.
Attention to the problems that May faced, trying to reconcile her deeply dissolved lines, even more attracted the fact that the deputy from the Conservative Party who acted against exit joined a special protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying to make a compromise plan of Chequers, despite the attacks by the Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
Allies insist that she won't leave trying to deal with Brussels, despite the negative response, and make eurosceptics and labs choose between what she offers and the chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave in Solihal, Mr. Bone said he wanted to "reject Chequers."
He invited Mr. Faraju to leave the shadows and to take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for it, we'd have already gone," he said.
The parliamentary parliament Vellingboro added, "I'm going to support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We fought in world wars not to be subjected.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that, after the vote of 2016, the public thought changed, "The idea that the British had changed their mind and did not want to go out, is absolutely unreal."
A member of the Conservative Party and the advocate of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, "Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the broad public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists who actually walk across the streets and fight for votes of voters.
Please dismiss Chequers and start listening."
In addressing Teresa May, she added, "The Prime Ministers keep their position when they make promises."
Mr. Farage said that politicians should "feel pressure" if they're going to refuse the decision taken on the referendum in 2016.
"It is now a matter of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say that they won't get away with it."
In the report to the enthusiasm of the crowd, he added, "I want our political elite that plans to betray the idea of Brexit to feel pressure.
We're mobilizing the people's army of this country that will lead us to the Brexit victory and never calm down until we become an independent, self-reward, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the exit opponents went by Birmingham and then held a two - hour mitting in the center of the city.
Several activists were waving with the Brexit Conservators after they started this weekend.
Laborist Lord Adonis laughed at the conservators because after the opening of the conference, their party program caused security problems.
"Those are people who tell us that they can use IT systems and technologies necessary for Canada-plus, a well organised border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a full farce.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about chattering for the president's post.
The United States Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the November elections, she'll "consciously think about chatting for the president's post."
The Boston Globe reports that the representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts told about its future on Saturday during the general congregations in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Tramp, has been chattered in November on the second term against a member of the Republican Party Jeff Dill, who was the head of the Tramp campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is considered to be a major candidacy that can combat Tramp in 2020.
On Saturday daily, 36th meeting with the voters in the form of the general congregations since Tramp joined the post.
She asked her if she planned to participate in the presidential elections.
Warren said, "We're time for women to go to Washington and set up the government's work, and for that, there's a woman on his head."
The suspect was arrested for the murder of the L.U. Tigers basketball player.
The Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, reported on Saturday, that a suspect was arrested on Friday for the murder of a firearm basketballist L.U. Tygers. Wade Simms.
The Baton Rouge Police Office announced an arrest of 20-year-old Ditton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in eastern time.
On Friday, they published a video of shooting with a request to help recognize the person on it.
The 20-year-old Simms was shot at the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wade Simms received fire wounds in the head and died as a result," stated on Saturday to the journalists 247sports Chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wade stood up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result, the interrogation found that Simpson was at the crime scene, had guns with him and shot Wade Simms.
The Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken under custody in the police office of East Baton County.
Sims, of which he was 6 feet and 6 inches, and he spoke in a youth league, grew up in Baton Rouge, and he played 32 games with 10 stars in the past season, and he spent 17.4 minutes on the field, collecting 5.6 points and 2.9 picks.
Granpri Russia: Lewis Hamilton reduced restraint in the fight for the world's title after the team decided to give him a victory on Sebastian Fettel
Since the Saturday Valttery Bottas left behind Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes’ command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from a pole-post and almost circled by Hamilton, who tried to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his companion by the team.
Fettel went to the pot-stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the race tail that had to solve everything.
The Mercedes pilot passed another circle and went behind the Fettel, but Hamilton ran into leaders after a maneuver with a wheel to the wheel, which led Ferrari to leave the inside space because of the risk that he would be pressed, after the result of a double maneuver he managed to get forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen launched from the back of the grid and stayed seventh to the end of the first circle.
He fought the majority of the race because he did not change his tyre to come to the finish quickly and to put Kimmy Rikkonan out of the fourth place.
In the summary, he stopped at a pot-stop on the 44th circle, but he couldn't increase the rate of the last eight, so Rickkonn set the fourth place.
"It's a tough day, because Waltery was exposed to the full on all weekends and showed nobleness when he gave me the opportunity to ride.
The team has performed an exceptional job to possess the first and second place," said Hamilton.
The Tongue of the Body
On Saturday's meeting, President Donald Tramp laughed at Senator Diane Finstein for her firm position in not reporting the contents of Christine Blaze Ford, accusing the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano of sexual violence.
During the west Virginia meeting, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford before the Legal Committee of the Senate, but instead expressed his view of events in the Senate, which, he said, demonstrated human "freeness, grossness and lie."
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that have been happening in the last few days in the Senate is anger, you see the wicked people showing violentness, disgustingness and lying," he said.
"You're looking at publications and disseminated information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you report the information?
Recall her answer... did you disclose the contents of the documents? — “What?
Oh, no.
I did not disclose it."
Wait a minute.
We advertising?... no, we didn't announce," he added, copying the behavior of the senator.
In July, Phinestein received a letter with a detailed deposition of the accusations made by Ford against Cavano, and at the beginning of September, the contents of it were announced, but Phinestein denyed that the leak of information had occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't announce the information received from it," said the Finstein Committee, reporting the Hill.
"She asked me to keep it in secret, and I didn't break my promise."
However, her denial seems to be displeased by the president who commented during the Saturday Summit, "I'll tell you, the language of her body wasn't quite impressed.
Maybe she didn't do that, but I haven't seen anyone get worse."
Continuing to defend a candidate to the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual violence, the president assumed that democrats were using accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to restore power in any necessary way.
You can see the uglyness, the embarrassment, they don't care who to insult, who has to go through to get power and control," Mediaite quotes the president's words.
The elite League: "Dandi Stars" is Belfast Giants, 5:3
The Jayants player Patrick Dwighter put two balls in a game against Dundee.
Dundy Stars were rehabilitated for the Friday defeat in the elite League of Belfast Jayants, winning a match on Saturday with account 5:3.
"Jayants" got an early advantage in two shabs because of Patrick Duyer and Francis Bovillier's drops.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney compared the bill in the home game, and then Dwighter reiterated the Jayants.
The Dandi player François Bushar compared the account, and two of Lucas Lundwald Neilsen's goals have secured their victory.
This is the third in the elite League season, the defeat of Adam Kiff's team, who won a voluntary victory over Dundi, with account 2:1 at Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth meeting of the teams in the season.
The first scaibu Dwighter dropped for the fourth minute (3:35) after the transfer of Kendall McFoll, and four minutes later, Boville, who received a score from David Rezerford, doubled the account.
After the tense first period in the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sullivan returned the householders to the game, and at the sixteenth minute (15:16) Cooney, receiving a score from Matt Markwardt, compared the account.
Dwighter's preferred "Jiants" before the first break, throwing his second bat at the end of the first period.
The masters of the field regrouped, and the Bouchar, for the twenty-eighth minute (27:37), re-exchanged the account by dropping the shift when his team was numerously overcome.
Thanks to Cooney and Charles Corcoran Neilsen's efforts at the end of the second period, the first time he made the Dundi forward and made his team win in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Jayants team, who's already lost four of the five last matches, will play a trip game against Milton-Kines.
Aviation Controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid earthquake
Aviation controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he helped fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a strong earthquake caused by tsunami on the Sulaves Island on Friday.
The strong underground strike continues to shake this area, and many people are under the ruins in Palu.
However, unlike their colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the dispatching tower at the Mutiara SIS Al-Juffrey airport in Palo.
He was staying there to make sure that flight 6321 of the Batik Air air air, which was at the time on the landing railway, went up safely.
Then he jumped out of the dispatch tower when he thought it was ruining.
Later he died in the hospital.
The representative of the Indonesian airline supplier Johannes Sirite stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News Agency.
We prepared a helicopter from Ballippapan to Kalimantan, which was to get him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
"We are very sad to hear about it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims can reach thousands, because the country's agency has a limited access to the towns of Dongal, Sigi, and Buttong.
"The number of victims may rise because many bodies are still under fractures and many of them cannot be reached," said the representative of the Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves of the heights of six meters destroyed the city of Palu, where mass funerals would take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide support and food.
Rizza Kusum, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Each minute, a quick help brings the bodies.
There's no clean water.
Minimarkets are robbed everywhere."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Ian Helfand, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia has hurried for helping people who have experienced this tragedy, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
President of Indonesia Joco Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and asked the military officers of the country, "I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the tasks involved in evacuation.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered from earthquakes in Lombok Island, which resulted in more than 550 deaths.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: as said in Air Niugini, after a plane falling into the lagoon, one man disappeared from the loose
The airline that carried out an accident in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one person disappeared, although earlier reported that all 47 passengers and crew were well evacuated from a drowning plane.
The Air Niugini stated that the state of Saturday cannot be found by one passenger.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a husband and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
The airline did not respond immediately to the request for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The local boats helped to save other passengers and the team after the plane fell on the water when he tried to land at the island of Chuk.
On Friday, the officials reported that seven men were delivered to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all stable.
The cause of the disaster and the precise sequence of events are unknown.
In the airlines and the U.S.A. stated that the plane landed in the lagoon near the landing line.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew over the landing line.
The American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane flyed very low over the earth.
"It's very good," said Janes.
Janes told him that he and others were able to go to an emergency exit on a thin airplane by belt in the water.
He told him that the stewardes panicked and screamed, and that he had a slight head trauma.
U.S.A. reported that seafarers working close to the modernization of the harbor also helped to deliver people to the shore with a naft boat before the plane drowned at 30 feet [100 feet] water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data, in the last two decades, 111 people died in accidents related to an aircraft registered in PNG, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst renewed the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the accusation party violated the case against a man accused of burning women from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The US Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in operational development for a few hours.
He told the jury members how he used cell phone records to reproduce 29-year-old Queenton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Rowlett, according to the Clarion Ledger, reported that he received information about the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sanford witnessed and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lies because my truck was in Nashville."
Another problem was that Tellis claimed that Chambers knew about two weeks before she died.
The phone records indicated that they knew each other only a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers’ phone.
"He removed it from his life," said Gale.
Protection should put out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be transferred to the jury later the same day.
The High Breed: what is a deliberate hip-hop?
Trio hip-hop performers want to challenge a negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed Group of Bristol claims that the hip-hop changed its nature -- left political ideas and the fight for solving social problems.
They want to get back to the sources and make a conscious hip-hop again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed the renewal of this directive in the United Kingdom thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark man?!
In New York, the nanny filed a couple for exemption, received a "racist" message.
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit for discriminatory release after she got the wrong addressed message from her mother complaining that she was another dark.
Marriage denies that they are racists, comparing the lawsuit to the demand.
Lyncy Plasco Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw a new nanny, Giselle Morris, who arrived on her first working day in 2016, a dark woman.
"No, one's dark," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the report.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she twice sent him Miss Morris.
According to the New York Post, aware of her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt "whispered" and released Miss Morris, saying that her previous nanny, who was African, had been doing a bad job, and she was expecting a nanny from Philippines instead.
Miss Morris paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now, Morris is taking a couple to court, expecting to receive a reimbursement for the salary, which she would have received in six months of living in a marriage to which she was first hired, although without a contract, was paid 350 dollars a day.
"I want to show them that I don't have to do this," she said, "And she said, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusation that they were racial, the marriage stated that the release of Morris was a reasonable decision because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after they were insulted.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said her husband, Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with a man who acted rude, even if it wasn't deliberate?
Your baby?
THAT'S GOING."
In comparison with "requirement", Plasco said that his wife had only had a child two months ago and "no more reaction."
"Would you revenge someone after that?
It's a bad act," added the investment banker.
Although the judicial proceedings are still ongoing, the Court of Justice quickly condemned this couple in social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
According to the new letter, the publishers of Podington feared that readers would not understand the idea with a bear who is able to speak
The daughter of Bonda Karen Jankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to print, said about the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know about the huge success that was gained by the Paddington story."
Relaxing that her father, who worked as an operator of BBC, before a little toy bear inspired him to write a child book, optimisticly responded to the fact that his work was denied, she shared as the 60th anniversary of the exit of the book at the same time felt "happy and sadness" because the father died a year ago.
With regard to Paddington, who she described as a "very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book became so popular.
"He was quite a modest man and didn't like to brag," she said.
"But Paddington was as real to him as a child of his own, because when children achieve something, we are proud of them, not theirs, not our victories.
I think he looked at the success of the Dington.
Although Paddington is the creation of his imagination, he has always succeeded in it."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was transported to a 2 hospital named Louis Paster in Nica, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Aside he regularly called, said that it was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperus.
"And then Nah called me and said she would die for the next two minutes and I must say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Thashi, darling, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
Medicines that the doctors gave her to keep her heart fighting gradually ceased and left her body.
She died for a while before everything was disconnected.
I had to just sit and wait, knowing what's going on at this time.
I couldn't squeeze, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep myself in the hands."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who was grieving about her daughter’s loss, sat on a plane along with other passengers, noting the severe trials she had to face.
"No one knew," she said.
"I fell down my head and couldn't keep tears.
It was difficult to explain, but it was just when I flew, I began to feel deeply compassionate to Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from putting their hands on themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfris leave on the Valley bridge cards with phone numbers for which people can look for support, as well as messages that please to inspire them.
Miss Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at his age of 18, he put his hands on himself.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way I feel every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Ledna, told her son was a prospective chef with an attractive smile.
"Everyone knew him for a smile.
They always said that this smile made any room lighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he wasn't in darkness.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11, found his brother’s body after he put his hands on himself.
Miss Davis says, "I'm constantly afraid that this will have consequences."
Miss Davis made postcards, "that people know there are those to whom they can contact and talk, even if it's just a friend.
"Don't keep your mouth shut, you need to talk."
Miss Hamfris, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband Mark, who had lived with her 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he felt depressed, that he had depression or something," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that it changed."
And on Christmas day, he was finally disgusted, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death had become a huge trauma for them, but they should have survived it, "This put a ruinful one.
I'm going to have a family.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Bretta Cavano hangs on his hair: the FBI is starting the investigation
"I thought that if we could get what we asked -- limited in time and in the nature of the investigation -- we might have reached a certain consent -- said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and he added that he was afraid that the committee is "depleting" on the basis of the unreliable loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Cavano and his Republicans want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is related to time.
The intermediate elections will only pass in five weeks, on November 6th, and if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously make their attempts through the election of their own person to the Supreme Court of the State.
George W. Bush called the senators with a request to support Mr. Cavano, who worked at the White House for the rule of Mr. Bush, and he met his wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI prepares his report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently in session, there will be a vote.
It's still not clear whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pens to solve the same number of votes and approve his candidacy to the Supreme Court of Justice.
During Kim's reign, the number of transgressors from North Korea "shooked"
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of transgressors from North Korea to South Korea decreased, stated the South Korean legislator.
Pyon Seug, referring to the data of the Ministry of the Unitedation of the Republic of South Korea, stated that last year, the number of survivors was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that key factors were to strengthen border control between North Korea and China, as well as that that smugglers who carry illegals now require more money.
In Pheniana, they abstained from public comments.
The major majority of the North Korean convicts eventually offer South Korea's citizenship.
In Seul, more than 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean war in 1953.
The majority runs through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the well protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers the perpetrators as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forces them to repatriate.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally in war, have improved in the past months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenyan and discussed the question of denuclearization, the negotiations of which were impaired.
This happened after the June historic meeting of President Donald Tramp and Kim Chen Ina in Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yon-Ho, on the basis of the sanctions adopted by the United States, has accused the United States of the lack of progress since.
"Without confidence in the United States, we can't be sure of our country's security, so there can be no one-sided disarmament in these circumstances," said Ri Yon-Ho in his presentation at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Cavano "hysterical" and says he's not good for work in the Supreme Court.
The Leader of the Minority House of Representatives Nancy Pelossi called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Cavano "histerical" and stated that he was unfit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I thought all the time that if a woman ever spoke this way, she would be called "histerical," Pelosi commented on her response to the Cavano testimony before the Legal Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally denied the accusation of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introduction, Cavano acted very emotional, sometimes screaming and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "absurd and coordinated destruction of the reputation", organized by liberals who were angry that Gillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi believed that Cavano’s testimony had proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, since it showed his prejudice to the democrats.
"I think that these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and democrats, will take his own candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was upset when she was asked if she would try to announce Cavano's impeachment if his guilt was confirmed, and whether the democrats would be received by most representatives in the House.
"I'll say, if he doesn't tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, it's not only good for work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," Pelossi said.
Cavano is currently a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Cavano against the law of "Available Medical Service" or Row v. Wade's case, because it's considered a conservative judge.
At his hearing on the issue of approval in Cavano, he circled the question of whether he would cancel some decisions by the Supreme Court.
"Now it's not the time the judge becomes hysterical, an predominant person and we'll say how great it is," Pelosi said.
Women must own this weapon.
These are just words that contain accumulated months and years of anger, and she could not pronounce them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," said Miss Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something unusual, do you?"
She continued, "A woman who used to work as an executive director somewhere and helped me very much, said that she was crying when she was angry, but she had her own method, and when she was mad and starting to cry, she said to her, "You can think I'm sad and I'm so crying.
And I am angry."
And then she just continued.
I thought it was amazing."
The tears are viewed as a permitable way out of anger partly because they are differently viewed.
One of my most explicit memories of the first job in the office where men worked mostly, was the situation when I once cried from an unreasonable anger, and the older woman, the unhealthy manager I was always a little afraid, grabbed me for a coat and pulled me on a staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to get to you."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from the Democrats from Colorado, worked with Gary Garth at presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught on an extra-marriage boat called Monkey Business, then he left the race, deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided that there were no reasons why she couldn't fly for the president's post.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said with a laugh in 30 years.
"The race took part in seven other candidates, and another candidate is the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation "Black and Seven Patutes."
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she was retaining the funds in the congregation, so she promised that she would not take part in the race unless she gathered two million dollars.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her advocates, who did not regret the support of men of $1,000, only gave her $ 250.
"They think they're going to give me a lower?" she wondered.
When she spoke with the speech and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, it was covered by emotions — appreciation for those who supported it, disappointment by a system that made the collection of money very complicated and forced the voters not as to the members of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as the angryness of sexism.
"You would have thought I had a nervous breakthrough," mentioned Miss Schroeder's press response.--
You'd think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
Did I still think about what they would write on my grave?
"She cried?"
As a trade war between the United States and China can benefit from Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and although far before it is complete, in a long - term perspective, the divorce between countries could benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Tramp made the first warning shots at the beginning of this year, taxing basic Chinese export products, such as solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The biggest situation this week has been accelerated by the new carriages of $200 billion ($50 billion), which actually taxes half of all the goods in the United States from China.
Beijing returned the same coin every time, recently putting a bribe of five to ten percent on American goods in the amount of $60 billion.
China had committed to taking similar measures, and the second largest economy in the world would hardly soon miss the possibility to follow that promise.
Forcing Washington to retreat means accepting the requirements, but for the President of China, the public worship of the United States is too disgraceful.
However, according to experts, if Beijing uses the situation properly, the pressure in the U.S. trade war can make China a long-term advantage, reducing the relationship between two economies.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a rapid economic fall in any of the countries, which is actually more danger than the observers had previously admitted," said Abigail Grace, an analyst, who deals with Asia in the Center for New American Security.
Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was "prepared" to return refugees.
In Syria, it is claimed that they are ready for a voluntary return of refugees and are called for help in the renewal of a land desolated by a war that lasted over seven years.
On speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Valid Al-Mualem, stated that the conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer because of the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
At the moment, all conditions for voluntary return to the country they had to leave through terror, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and limited the means of existence.
UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people who are still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to receive assistance in the renewal of a ruined war by the country.
But he emphasized that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries supporting the rebellion.
Europe boosts a victory on the Rider Cube in Paris
Europe's team conquered the Rider Coubcock in 2018, when the United States team won the summary of 16,5:10.5 on Le Golf National in front of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated six times in Europe and hasn't won the "Cubox Ryder" tournament here since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn got 14,5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star, Phil Michelson, who made all his best to the majority of the tournament, broke his first long-term blow on the 16th hole of par-3 into the water, and Francesco Molinari went into the water.
Italian golfist Molinari won in all his rounds and became one of the four players who had ever been through the 5 to 0 accounts from the beginning of the modern format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit has defeated the account of 5:4 from a player with the lowest rating in the European team of Turbiern Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world's rating, made an account of 2:1 of Jana Poulter from England, who may have been in the last time in the Rider Cube.
The Spanish Serchio Garcia, the veteran of Cubka Ryder, who was already involved in the tournament eight times, became a European, who wins most times in the tournaments all the time, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a hard year.
Thank Thomas for choosing me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to get the cup back.
It's the crew's worth, and I'm glad I could help," he said, "without the emotions, Garcia after winning in Europe.
He transmits the estaphet to his cousin John Rem, who won the American legend of golf Tyger Woods on Sunday in a single game with account 2:1.
"I feel an incredible pride of winning Tyger Woods, and I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four matches, and now he has a career record on Rider's 13-21 tournament.
The strange statistics for one of the most famous players of all the time who won 14 Major tournaments only by Jack Niclaus.
The United States Assembly has tried to reach the Farvey area during all weekends, except for Patrick Rid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, showing a high - class golf throughout the tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furick said about his team after the uncomfortable speech, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we had a short domination over Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking off the hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the U.S. Golf Association and the Cookie Ryder Tournament Committee, and we're going forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud of being their captain.
You can't ignore them.
We're losing."
