The Prague Bureau has fallen into a minus at the end of the trade.
After the morning, the Prague Storm corrected the losses.
The transactions with the CEZ shares have reached almost half the normal daily trade.
The Prague Bureau was attached immediately from the beginning of the Tuesday trade to its Monday crash when it dropped by almost six percent.
This time, it's behind the decline of the Wall Street stock.
This is how the market response is shown to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to support the stability plan of the financial sector.
Action Fall in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday experienced stocks on the markets in Asia, even though the indexes were finally deleted during the day of losses.
The Hang Seng Burze index in Hong Kong has recorded nearly four percent during the trade, but later the losses have been removed and decreased to approximately 2.5%.
The index of Hang Seng China Enterprises, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8 per cent, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The bureau in Sydney lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Thai-waan storm, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
"The timeout for rescue action in the United States is uncertain and will affect the financial markets throughout the world," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, determines the monetary policy separately, therefore no dependency on the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates of Hong Kong are at the same level as the United States.
US legislators should, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, quickly return to the negotiations and approve the proposal for financial support system.
Otherwise, it is said that the impacts will also be affected by other countries.
Bloody bath of American stocks
The American House of Representatives rejected on Monday the financial system's support plan, which was to be made up to $700 billion (almost 12 billion Kƒç).
The lawmakers so ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the basic causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a blood bath in Monday, and main stock indexes recorded the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
Dow Jones' index dropped by almost seven percent and the fall in similar scope was last recorded in 1987.
The index has fallen before the vote, but once it turns out that the proposal in the House has not passed, the index appeared to be in a free fall.
Congress resigned: U.S. government can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The highest representatives of the US Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of a financial aid agreement for the US financial system.
The vote will be the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators have broken into the negotiations on the approval of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion of crowns).
However, it is not yet victory.
Congressmen must conclude some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The support plan of the financial system will be discussed on the grounds of the House of Representatives on Monday.
The President of the Banking and Financial Services Committee of the House of Barney Frank told the Agency Reuters on Sunday.
In the Senate, the sources suggest that the plan could be voted at first in the Wednesday.
According to economies, the notification of the approval of the rescue plan should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, there will be a "treatment" because of the complexity of mechanisms to help markets to achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our different views on how the package to stabilize the market," the Democrat Nancy Pelosi said for the Bloomberg Agency.
According to her, the final vote could be done on Sunday.
The representatives of the lawmakers met with the US Minister of Finance Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definite form to the government fund.
It should buy unprofit mortgage assets from financial companies that download financial companies into severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the border of the definitive agreement of the plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue in a healing plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis is significantly affected by the stock markets that are rapidly declined.
According to the Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to calm the investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where the decision of the Congress could affect Monday trade.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when both American Congress Chambers will vote on the law, or whether the negotiations can be taken into account at the last moment of a problem.
Legislators hope that it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will still learn a number of changes.
The total amount for the aid of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the relief of the remaining amount if it makes the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, following another $100 billion, and later the final $350 billion.
Bush appreciated progress in negotiations
Although the President may vet this decision, Congress may overray its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme remained, which was acquiring funds for the purchase of bad hypothetical securities, whose value has fallen down because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, remained.
"We've worked everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress in the negotiations is satisfied with the US President Bush.
His speaker Tony Fratto declared that Bush is satisfied with the Saturday progress and appreciates "the two-party efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Reduction of golden falls
The President of the Bank Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the negotiator, said that the legislators agreed to be responsible for the monetary programme, to protect taxpayers from losses, to close relief, to time the financing of the plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called gold drops to the directors of the programme and establish a committee that will supervise the Fund.
He should be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We worked very hard on this, and we made great progress towards a deal that will work and be useful for the market for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts on help for homeowners who have problems with paying.
The government should negotiate new payments for the mortgages he buys in order to reduce monthly costs for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological aid
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy, Patrio Finance David Mark, a good idea, but it will be very difficult to realize.
"It is because it is not known which mechanism and at what cost the problems of assets will be purchased.
This will be determining how they divide the losses between the financial sector and the government," said this week for the iHNet server.cz Marek.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of the next week, it is not so important to Mark.
"It is much more important that congressmen agree to support this plan and devote it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on the event of approval is the most important moment at this point," Marek emphasized.
A fight on a knife blade: MP3 mobile players.
We'll advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
It seems clear that it's better to buy just a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons for a person to acquire a separate player.
The choice is entirely dependent on the method of use and demands of the future owner.
I guess it's hard for you to get a high-dear, expensive gramophone to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc.
However, such musical products on the LP panels do not come from a quality perspective and there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you blame art rock, jazz or blues in your fields, you probably dream of a gramophon like that at least.
It's the same with the music on the roads, that's a compressed music, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For someone it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for the player, as well as Pink Floyd's fan is likely hard to test the ears for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also decides to endure batteries
Some top music players can handle much more than just playing music, but what most mobile players are not.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, calling and texting, he can play music and videos, both record, he has a better, worse camera, and maybe he can navigate.
And if we take the smartphones and the communications, you'll have a little computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV photographs anything.
Mobile universality also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your cell phone, the sooner the display indicator will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy crops.
A few cell phones can play music for more than ten hours, mostly it's much less.
In this direction, music players (specifically the easiest) are significantly more effective.
So count on the cheap phones that they won't play for more than a few hours.
If you call in here and there, get to work for another charger - that's true for more expensive devices.
In MP3 players you will not have this problem, even those worse will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation for one charge.
Another problem is when you write music to your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not each of them can directly connect to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can deal with miniature memory cards that are used in their mobile phones without reducing.
You do not need any special software for players except for exceptions (iPod).
All you need to do is fill the music through the USB from the computer.
Most mobiles and players are already creating a music library, sorted by the name of interpretation, name of Alba, genre, or, for example, the user's evaluation.
Some devices only display a tree structure of directories like the Windows Browser and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
Players are easy to handle, mobile phones are more skillable
When selecting a specific device, care in particular about the sustainability of the battery, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, also the comfort of control.
If you have music mainly in the culiss, and if you listen to it every day just a little bit, like in the tramway, you'll have any mobile phone that plays MP3.
Which already can do almost any cell phone.
You don't have to watch what musical formats the mobile or the player can do.
MP3 can handle all and the complete majority of music that comes to you will be in this format.
It belongs to the most widest and, besides it, the total majority of devices can handle music in the WMA format.
Less of the AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also allow for the purchase of music online.
All you need to do is visit the operator‚Äôs (or other suppliers) and the song or album.
This service could already be a good argument for the acquisition of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and mostly limited only to fast-coated radio hits.
Prices are not also lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this is the way to sell music (as through GSM, the Internet or the wireless Internet) will be able to control the music industry in the future.
Mobile most people still carry with them.
Whenever you get a taste to listen to something, the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it is still important if you are always wearing ears or at least wire free handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated reproductor that has almost every mobile, but only the minimum MP3 players.
Probably the greatest advantage of music phones will be for many prices.
The cheapest is usually under 3,000.
In three and four thousand crowns, you'll already have a very decent walkman.
But mostly, you will be limited to the absence of output to normal hearings.
The best and technical phones are the most equipped and with a 3,5 mm mirror for usual listeners are worth 15,000.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy service.
The easiest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) - the players can actually control everyone.
Minimum functions, similarity to control with a previously common tape or perhaps a gramophone is obvious.
There is no collision in the form of mistakes in the mobile internet and subsequently the giant account for the transfer of data.
What kind of device to touch
Even cheapest cell phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot on exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the corresponding card, you're going into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models only cards with maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can deal with 8 GB memories.
If you already have a cell phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, touch Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you belong to more difficult listeners, please touch the specialized mobile phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsungy).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and comfort services are thus approaching separate MP3 players.
In addition, it is in Sony Ericsson, whose phones from a range of walkman have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
The same service and in the same price category to four thousand crowns, but with greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and endurance of the battery (on 15 hours, up to 35 hours) will take you from the above-mentioned marks MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our operators offer almost all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we miss something here -- a virtual operator that would make the classic cheap.
Maybe it won't be missing long.
About the Czech operators belonging to the most expensive in Europe, we wrote on Mobile.cz many times.
Furthermore, the CTU also confirmed that the SMS price is higher than the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on Roaming Tax Regulations, there may be a paradox situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, the SMS from abroad will be cheaper than home.
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic are maintained in comparison with Europe so high?
The answer is simple, there is no competitiveness that would really want to go into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxic, but we have three mobile networks and penetration over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators love to play that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The President of the Czech Telecommunications Council (CTU) Paul Dvo≈ô√°k, who has expressed himself several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in Czech Republic.
It's probably true that a classic operator with his own network is probably not having too much chances (in the end, he'd probably just hardly look for frequencies.)
But there's another option - a virtual operator.
The introduction of virtual operators to the mobile market has just brought a significant reduction in prices that classic operators had to respond to.
However, before the entry, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices in Britain like us.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
Otherwise, we don't have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you of the launch of a virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In just a half year, this operator was able to obtain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator.
The Penta financial group, which owns U:fona in Czech, stands behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, they have much less customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs on construction, operation and maintenance of mobile networks.
In the world, virtual operators are usually profiled as low-tech - offer cheap calls and SMSs, which is often exported by a higher service offer.
So, for example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than his competitors.
But as shown in the example of Mobilking in Poland, it may be a pretty good move and a bet on an infinite target group.
Because this operator focuses specifically on men.
"People choose Mobilking - Operator who they like and whom they can trust," said David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operated by this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a similar concept as in Poland could be caught with us.
The press speaker of Vodafon Miroslav ƒåepski doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach on which most virtual operators are based.
Furthermore, it is relatively saturated in terms of the offer of services."
In Czech Republic no chance, mobile operators say
But it seems almost sure that if there is a virtual mobile operator in Czech Republic, it won't be mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations don't seem too hopeful in Czech Republic.
It is more likely to be launched by Mobilking in other countries of our region," she said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studniƒçkova, a press speaker of the Penta Financial Group.
It was not directly confirmed that existing mobile operators in Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, he's trying to do anything to make no potential competitive appearance.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator is no longer available by the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of the O2 Telephone field.
"We have a great interest in offering not only firm, but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly dealt with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them," says Paul Kaidel, press speaker.
So maybe it's shineing for better times.
The unofficial information seems that we should wait for the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But so far, its formation is carried out by an invisible silence wall.
"We do not believe that there is a space on the Czech market for a full-value virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
No entity with a complex and serious project in this area has yet addressed us," said in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil ≈†≈°e≈à from the press committee Telephones O2.
The specificity of the Czech market is also referred to by other operators.
The press speaker T-Mobilo Martina Kemra delivers in rare conformity with the expression O2: "We have not yet recorded any life-specific and both-profit business project that could continue to be built."
And he adds, "In the T-Mobile network, a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a specific agreement on the table to be considered in this short horizon."
The waterphone focuses rather on compliance with the requirements of its 3G licence.
Miroslav ƒåepski says to this: "We are open with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
That's what we think is the most favourable of the customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, the price reduction and thus the decline of their profits.
Why, then, would such a competitive approach make it easier?
The fact that when the operators are concerned with something, they can pull for one rope, also testify about the formation of U:phone.
Probably the biggest pressure towards the CTU went at the time of the creation of U:phone from T-Mobile.
It is aware of public accessible information from the CTU website.
Now, however, U:phone is suitable as a argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemra reported: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator on the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would put high requirements on it and, in particular, on its services."
In view of this approach of mobile operators, however, it is directly infecting the absolute independence of the Czech regulatory authorities.
It's not just the position of the CTU, which is unfortunately in Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other excellent countries - has no power to interfere with the competition.
They belong exclusively to the Competition Protection Office (UOHS).
But he took his typical attitude to the whole problem.
"The entrance of a virtual operator to the mobile market would be possible after a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has yet been concluded, since the offer of potential interesters was probably not sufficiently interesting for classical operators," Christian Chalupa said in response to our question from the committee of external relations to UOHS.
It may not be surprised by the representatives of the operators of this formed expression.
It is more than reasonable from the Authority that represents the interests of consumers and, inter alia, to ensure that no one uses its position on the market.
Especially when Christian Chalupa adds: "In abroad where virtual operators usually operate, we can observe that their market entry contributed to reducing prices for mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and price decline does not belong to the interests of the UOHS.
In the truth shocking on the whole case, there is a thrilling contingency of three mobile operators resulting from their reactions.
The question is, if it's just a coincidence, it's offering itself.
Just like the total price of gasoline in pump stations is certainly just part of a coincidence and a hard competitive fight.
"The Authority did not seek any signs of competitive action in this matter, and therefore there is no reason to interfere.
No operators have a dominant position, so there is no corresponding increased responsibility for their marketing actions.
The necessary tools for the opening of the mobile market for virtual operators may also be missing the telecommunications regulator," Chalupe said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many dispute points.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTU, which makes telecommunications from the perspective of competition the only market.
Of course, no Czech operators have a dominant position in such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires a network operator's approval.
And the mobile operator -- he has a very logical sense -- on his network monopoly.
So in a certain segment, they must be dominant.
Even if we do not accept this argument, for UOHS, it should be at least warned that three mobile operators are doing similarly.
However, the complaints of a number of stakeholders (including the GTS Novera) indicate that in the negotiation with all operators, they inflict very similar obstacles.
Miscellaneous responsibilities at the CTU is then a relatively common trick in telecommunications that UOHS gives his hands away from the whole matter.
We've met him in a few similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted novels of the Telecommunications Law have extended the powers of the CTU to competitive competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS must know more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's good when no one's looking
However, without notice, there are some pseudo-virtual operators who have a number of mobile networks.
These are companies who issue their own mobile phone services prices, but they are only partially public.
It's usually a company dealing with multilevel marketing.
The own mobile phone service offers such as Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others.
The prices of these companies usually get to the elected.
The magic is that the company is acting against the operator as a classic company customer that orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer then receives special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators are prohibiting similar sales.
"If cases you're talking about, there might be violations of the contractual conditions that we should deal with and could be concluded in collaboration with the company," Martin Kemerov√° answered our question to this problem.
But it is unlikely that similar activities would not be carried out to responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of three companies mentioned may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are advocated by such a procedure.
Because these companies have unnecessary profits and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav ƒåepski notes on possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by the negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not guided on their name, so they cannot have it fully as normal customers of mobile operators."
But that should be at least weird.
Furthermore, another question for UOHS is opened.
If mobile operators close their eyes over a similar procedure, why are they blocking the formation of a virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has a relatively strong power to disclose similar activities, and if it does not, it must not be satisfied with the explanation of the operators that they have no idea of anything like that and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As it has fallen in the text several times, the entry of virtual operators to the mobile market has brought a notable decrease in prices for services.
But practically in all countries where virtual operators were emerging, classic operators tried to defend their formation more or less.
Jimi used arguments were practically identical - too small, if possible too saturated market, problems with quality of services etc.
In advanced countries, however, at these moments, regulatory authorities have affected, not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether formal measures or informal pressure have achieved that the first virtual operator has been created and the other have been loaded on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are throwing the whole case as a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that inclusion in competences in these cases is more than suitable.
But let's not throw the flint into the ceremony.
If the background information is proper and the virtual operator will appear in us very soon, the Czech mobile market may be dispersed again.
If one of the operators has accepted a virtual mobile operator, it is hard to remain intangible to deny (discrimination) other stakeholders.
And we might stop calling more dramatically than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymna has four new versions.
Pick the best here
Listen to the four new version of the Czech state hymna.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek presented new recordings of state hymna where my home was presented on the occasion of the Day of Czech state.
Hymnu was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of George Whitehead.
There are four versions - with male or female soli singing, in the congregation application and instrumental text.
The singing was taken by Katerina Priestess and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the amendments of the hymna are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krƒçek.
On the iHNed server you can listen to all four versions.
The whitehead considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful himens.
He already told the Czech radio that he deliberately chose to sing solo variations of singers with young representative voices, which are significant and popular.
"In the beginning, I also tried to make sure that the congregation had a clear diction, so that the text was well understood to contemplate," he said.
The Czech state hymna will celebrate the 175. anniversary next year.
The song Where my home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of the Stavovski theater in the original Czech game Fidlovaƒçka Joseph Kayetan Tyl, supplemented by Francesco Scroup.
She gained popularity and people spontaneously took it as their own.
The first song of the song became a natural part of state hymna after Czechoslovakia was created in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the formation of the single Czech Republic.
How's "new" hymna sounding?
Prague MHD in Wednesday for the first lift and on chip
Wednesday 1 October 2008 the history of the Prague Traffic Undertaking as the date when the metro, tramways and buses enter the first passengers who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of paper tickets.
At this point, he can acquire approximately 10,000 people owning the Opencard chip card.
Travelers can buy 30 days and 90 days and a yearly coupon (this will be paid from 1 January 2009) and also allow them to record their chip card in info centres and jobs of the Traffic Business stations Museum, Bridge, Hole≈°ovice, Angel, Rostyle, Summer, Kobilise, Paradise Garden, Cacherov and Luka.
Coupons can be purchased from yesterday on the website www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers used the service by the afternoon.
Those who start using the Internet can definitely forget the expensive windows in subway stations where they had to stay regularly in long fronts on paper tickets.
Because the buyer buys on the Internet, and on the Opencard card, they will record it in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"In these places, the traveller is available a cross-border with a trained service that will help interesters with the Internet shopping and will also record a purchased coupon on their card," said the speaker of the project Martin Careful.
In addition to the books, you will be able to record electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-servicing automats mounted in several metro stations.
How do these machines look?
They are red, reminded of ticket markers, and the travellers may have already noticed them in the stations of the Metro Rastila, Budjayovska, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vlatavska.
"There are five in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," he added to the Careful.
The coupon will check the automatic driver's place
The automatic service that starts working tomorrow is simple.
All you need to do is put the Opencard chip card in them and the previously paid coupon will be recorded on it itself.
Electronic coupons have been paid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
In the suburb trains and bus lines with 300 to 499 travelling to the capital, mainly the inhabitants of the Central Czech Municipalities.
"In the trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers, using which they detect the time and zone validity of the coupons," Philip Drapal explained the check of tickets from the Ropid organization, which comprises the road orders of the Prague mass transport.
The suburban buses have card readers built in a cartridge with a driver.
It is therefore necessary not only to show the driver the chip card, but also to attach Opencard to a place on the side of the treasury.
This means that the driver will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If the traveller needs to verify the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking drivers for this information," Drapal added.
The travellers who do not ride in town buses and will not remember when their coupon is expired can go back to self-servicing machines where the coupons are recorded on the card.
Here the information on the validity of their documents is shown on the display of the appliance.
Judges wanted a referendum for the United States
In 1945, the Sudetic Germans asked for the inclusion of ≈†umawa in the United States.
It comes from a letter stored in the collections of the South Czech Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, accordingly, some groups of Sudetian Germans turned to the President of the United States.
This is, among other things, a letter that has been held in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Czech Scientific Library.
The Germans from Czech Krumlov request in a letter from the President of America to prevent the return of the "forest coats" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the monachy agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the right situation and we want to be sure in the words that the American units are not coming to the German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as the Liberators," the letter signed by "Ljudi whom the destiny of the Shumava is on the heart."
Because the connection to Czech Slovakia is allegedly accompanied by the Sudetian Germans - with the knowledge of the Czech national nature - the hope of only brutality, disagreement, disagreement, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the American President to take over the Forest Protectorate for the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter million inhabitants, you can acknowledge this territory to a foreign country who oppresss and distorts minorities and nothing, you will never contribute to the winning of the United States," the letter says.
The reason why authors can't be signed is, accordingly, the fear of revenge of Czech oppressors.
If the President of the United States had allegedly doubted the views of the woods Germans, it would be enough to arrange a referendum in the Forest Pocket to whether its inhabitants would be part of the United States or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today‚Äôs knowledge of war history, some memorials are properly illustrating the expectations of the Sudetian Germans.
Although the Czech Germans had to have at least understood that they would be retired from the Republic, few of them had at all accepted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a certain type of autonomy to the Sudets.
Others believed they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalopa, born in the Czech Budjejevic.
He was like a Buddeaux German on the Balt Navy.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holland, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would use the Czech," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia did not count on being removed from the Republic on the basis of Benesic decrees.
You don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive action aimed at safety on roads in Czech history.
However, an emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport is going to launch in the Wednesday.
The Office of Minister Alesh Ribbi promises to rescue drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, online, but also on flyers.
She should distract the drivers from rapid ride and alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind them to be tied before they leave.
He wants to touch his conscience mainly by young drivers, motor drivers, walkers, and also professional drivers.
And what's going to happen in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And that's the "blood" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think you'll pay!
The word "you don't think" is written by big letters on the Espeset.
And then the word "you pay."
This should symbolize that a person can pay his own life in a moment of immediate distraction.
The freaks will "scare" spots until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the English countries, where images with drastical images of victims of accidents can normally be seen.
It promises it will reduce accident and the number of dead on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and bee on drivers
"The driver's in charge of sugar and bee.
Sugar for them is that, for example, when they go to red, they save time.
Beach is a threat to punishment or accident.
The drivers must be reminded of the risk," says a transport psychologist at the Homolce Martin Ko≈ô√≠n.
And that's why the information campaign is needed in the press, and mostly negative advertising, is meant by a psychologist.
It says that the boards are less efficient than those that warn drivers of danger.
"If a statistical table warning against danger is installed, it will probably soon be connected with the environment and the drivers will not be devoted to it," Korean warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The Chairman of the temporary Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke to the return of almost all the territory occupied in 1967, that is Prejordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highness, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He did this in a interview that was printed by Jediot Achronot's diary on Monday.
"We must reach agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return nearly all (ocupied) territories, unless all of them are," Olmert said to the journal.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but the Palestinians will have to pass a similar percentage (the land of Israel), because without that there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or buldozers to pass his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," he noted Olmert in the exemption of two June attacks in the city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "specific solutions for the temple Mountain, holy and historical places", which lie within the Old city.
"The one who will want to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he emphasized further.
Departure from the Golan heights
Olmert also spoke for Israel‚Äôs departure from the Golan heights, which he believed as an unreasonable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I'm not suggesting that peace with Syria be concluded only on the basis of leaving Golan," he noted.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to gain Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hizballah (Shiet Movement); they will have to give up permanent support provided by terrorism (Shiit movement) to Hamas, (terrorism networks) Al-Kaida and Gihada (Saint Wars) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after an accident: Are the stewards in the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them. You can't go on a remote bus.
In connection with the tragic bus accident, the Student Agency near Italian Padova raised the question whether stewards and travellers could move on the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the steward is in contrast with the road traffic law," the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, says.
The accident last week, when a twenty - year - old steward girl died, apparently caused a truck driver who crossed the road.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, even though she had another two places.
However, the bus can crash, or hardly brake, even at the time the stewards spread coffee or newspapers.
The role plays whether the bus is equipped by the technical license.
If the bus is not homologated, the passengers must sit.
Remote buses Student Agency have no station site; what Currently.cz confirmed the Director of Radim Janchura.
"That's what the Ministry and I were dealing with, and the passengers first did not allow.
Afterwards we revoked it and we reached out that travellers are allowed to go to the bathroom if they have their seat," he told their opinion.
The Stuart Law doesn't know
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward - no legislation is dealing with this role.
However, no legislation does not prohibit the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the guide of the vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," the speaker Hanzelka provides less clearly.
The director of the Road Vehicle Management Board of the Ministry of Transport, Joseph Ponity, in contrast, considers the issue of the law to be treated sufficiently.
"It matters whether the bus in homologation is allowed to stand.
That's what it ends," he says.
The buses are divided into urban places where the stations are and limited maximum speed, intergrading places with higher speed permitted and remotely without spaces to stand with the highest allowed speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP expert on transport security Jaroslav Horyn in the movement of the stewards on the bus board does not see a major problem.
"All the dangers are not at risk, the situation can be compared to the aircraft service.
It's not even here when the turbulence comes, and the bullet can hit the head."
"But if the bus has hardly stopped, natural laws, of course.
Just like the city bus or the tramway.
The security of the stewards must address the carriers with internal regulations," he says, and it also considers, in the light of the law, the problem is unsolved.
Janchura is willing to cancel the service
Student Agency offers the services of stewards as the only bus carrier.
She's working for two hundred of them.
The director even after an accident does not consider their calling as risky.
"But once I get the impression that the call of the stewards is risky, I'll cancel it.
Coffee and papers can get travellers on the show.
It would also spare the costs," he said.
As an interest in security, the absence of stewards in his cars was caused by the Director of Asia Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of lines compared to SA.
"We don't have stewards, we're against it from the beginning.
Ever or later it ends with some deadly injury," he said a few years ago for the week.cz.
There's been an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a link connection in Neapol, a young stewardka from Plzensk, who worked for the company for two years, died.
The Slovenian truck probably slipped out without using the direction from the restraint line and blocked the bus.
His driver tried to avoid a hard maneuvre, but he disturbed the right front of him.
That two places to be sold for the rest of the stewards, Janchura refuses.
"This place is not possible for remote connections, it's blocked."
The company is going to sue the driver of the truck.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait at the court's array, but the financial refund is expected by the guilty.
Law adjustment?
Immediately
The examination of the movement of the stewards on the busboard could bring to the amendment of the law on which a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport works over a year.
"No concrete conclusion, however.
The buses do not solve too much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the road and the use of the mobile in the management," says the expert Gorin.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards to threaten the safety of passengers in a substantial way," speaker Hanzelka concludes that bus security control is in the power of the police and the labour safety authorities.
The hope of D√ºsseldorf is Frankfurt
The large words in the letter of the WestLB to the employees of this bank are not missing.
By connecting the units of this D√ºsseldorf monetary institution with the Frankfurts Deka-Bank, the Central Financial Group Institute will be accompanied by trade in capital markets,‚Äù we will see in a letter that has reached the public on Monday.
The WestLB shall, in accordance with the letter to this transaction, introduce a "set of competences" which provide for long-term profits.
And they say that such a connection can be a decisive impulse for further association in the world banks sector.
Such texts arise when the agency wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a difficult period.
The unstable WestLB is still under significant pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Social Office for Finance Oversight, whose notification of the country's government in North Porinie-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
The link between Deka-Bank, which customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, no matter what kind, has been discussed for a long time - even on the French party.
The Chief of Deka-Bank Franz Waas, when presenting semi-year economic results at the end of August, has heard that in the fusion of his banking house from Mainzer Landstra√üe with some of the earthly banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, there is no sense.
The Deka-Bank Administrative Board, which stands from one half of the earthly bank and from the other union, has, however, authorized the WestLB's representative to discuss joint business activities.
This could be business or part of the capital market.
However, the interviews have just begun, the financialers.
About Deka-Bank, which belongs to its 3,000 employees in the financial market in Frankfurt, does not speak for the first time in connection with consolidation in the competitive sector.
In 2003 it seemed to be a moment that it could have happened with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba bank.
There was nothing out of this triple eventually.
Shortly after the fusion plans reached the public, the Essenian country government spoke against the participation of the Helaba bank.
Both other banking houses didn't connect like that.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead obtained Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg from Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, speculation on the connection of Deka-Bank with the earth banks was repeatedly occurring.
However, recently, G√ºnther Merl, Chairman of the Bank of Helaba, expressed negatively to speculate on the connection of his financial house with others.
However, it appears that it is independent of the belief that the connection of different banking houses of the public governmental sector is a necessity.
Now, after elections to the earthly board in Bavorska, BayernLB's connection with Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg could be drawn first.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If pressure to further fusions should grow, it gradually loses possible partners for such a connection.
In the south, she would only play other violins, even though the financial crisis is facing significantly better than banking houses in Mnich and Stuttgart.
On the beginning of the year, WestLB forbided the Relationship by the Hessen-Th√ºringen jury banks, which has a 5-8-10% share in Helaba.
That's how Nord LB would look.
However, geostrategic considerations of this species are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, the question is how much business models of individual institutions are dealing with together.
In June, Merl declared that the crucial issue of the future competitiveness of the earthly banks should be provided by the business model, the German union, and the jury banks have not yet answered.
It could also end with the WestLB distribution, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
Therefore, the letter of the local branch also refers to a "complex solution" for the whole banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect individual files to Deka-Bank, it will show time.
The second weekend of Octoberfest is known as "the weekend with Italy"
It's for Elena for the first time, for Luca's third or fourth.
But this time, Elena's going to be his girlfriend, and she says everything's going to be different, she says.
A stronger beard stands behind them, with a five-liter tag of Kaiser, and two hundred tourists on the Octoberfest proves how deep tones can deliver his throat.
Elena Luca will dance first and then kiss him.
They've arrived in Verona from Bolonia.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova Station, they will leave this evening at 23.45 four buses with the label "destinazione Monaco, Festival della Birra", expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses are mainly the Italians, the Brazilians ride exclusively in one bus.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, celebrating at night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's nothing for Italy.
Marc, who wears a long coat with a sewing of a skin imitation and glasses with broad silver rings, belongs to these three buses.
He's been riding with them for five years to Octoberfest, only three trips this year.
At night, over the day between the beer beer stations, at 22:30, return.
The night would only mean inadequate expenses, says Marco.
The road costs 75 euros including a welcome toast with Kaiser beer, cooked exactly according to the Bavarian Law on Beer Cleanliness, Health Insurance and German speaking guide - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
The buses are on their way to Brennero.
There's no beer, not yet.
The bus shuts up fast, travellers sleep.
They're doing good, they're still gonna need their powers.
It is built in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the highway number 8 pieces before Mnich is doing another break and a lot of other buses with the Italian mark.
When Marc's group finally arrived in the parking lot at 6:30 a.m. near Theresienwesa, there are about 50 buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and others are gathering together, Marco has the last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all: put on a yellow hat.
It is written by "Octoberfest", next to Marco's website travel office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the door opens to the beer tent, run!" Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Go and take places in the back of the tent.
"Don't go ahead to stop, and not all the yellow hats on the same sheets, sit in the space!"
Maz is worth 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the drinking.
"Let's show the Securities that we're acting properly.
Once you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third: "That's exactly the eleventh night." Do you understand?
And upstairs to Vienna, space with beer states.
On the road, one member of the group hangs yellow hats as marks for trees, tags, and even on a large bavorian side.
You need to prepare for retreat.
Like "the weekend with Italy" is known for the second weekend of the Octoberfest.
The exact numbers of visitors are not available; they are talking about 50 thousand of those who travel across the Alps and fall into the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors arrived from Italy this weekend.
The monich police will strengthen seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavorian Red Cross, leading national statistics in which the Italians before the British (about 60 interventions) and the Rakuna (approximately 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments hold the first place.
Especially favorite is the Hofbr√§u tent in Italy.
Nightless for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Last week, Peer Steinbr√ºck, Federal Minister for Finance, emphasized that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relative" and has included the fact that the German banking sector will not remain saved of crisis development.
'Cause it was the last weekend.
In the Dax Index, the following financial house specializes in the financing of real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a loan from the German banks of several billion to protect from market turbulences.
The person familiar with the situation on Monday told the agency Reuters that this credit aid would be up to 35 billion euros.
The interests will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from a really exhausted amount.
They say the money comes from private and public law banks.
Depfa's daughter's loss is behind the background.
This state fundant, according to a report on the long-term projects for which he lended money, has refined extremely short-termly, which is now not possible because of non-reliance on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve dropped by 95 % to 2.37 million euros and the share of its own capital decreased easily from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The normal profits and net profits from financial trades, compared to the zero last year, the returns from an increase in the value of claims and certain securities, as well as the cancellation of the reserves for loan trade decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only due to higher reimbursements for subsequent accounting costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the refund of interests under the tax regulation and the mediation of trade for concrete enterprises, the 16 per cent decline on the receipt side was still mitigated.
The former government fundant, after his privatisation in 1990, burned on mortgages for farmers, which were then excluded from the service portfolio and continued to run the Aareal Bank.
Since the classical state funding was too low, Depfa was engaged more in infrastructure projects and in financing joint private investors and state projects (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and has been diverced internationally.
From the value of his daughter's company now, Hypo Real Estate has to write down something and these replies will have a "based material effect" for the calculation of profits and loss of the whole group, as some have let themselves hear uncertainly.
The fact is, the dividend won't be.
For 2007, it has been shortened by two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate is a significant financial fund of state and infrastructure projects since Depfa is taken.
The stronger than other institutions depend on refinance on the inter-bank market because they have no customers' contributions.
After the fall of the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers almost dried the source of interbank loans because the banks are preserving liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a year for part of Depfa's credit portfolio - approximately 50 billion euros - short-term refinance.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial need of the group is covered by this loan for a surveillance period and the company is protected "from the impact of international monetary markets at the moment to a considerable extent of incompetent functions".
Other sources have been heard that these money ensured refinance by the end of 2009.
The President of HRE Georg Funke, on the contrary, declared that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the cash markets in due time.
The Social Bank and the Social Institute for Finance Supervision (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now secured.
That's what shareholders and creditors of the bank hope for.
But in view of dynamics and inadequateness of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely excluded that the loan should not be completely exhausted.
However, it is not possible to exclude the opposite.
After the bank was standing in front of the insolvency late Sunday afternoon, it cannot be preliminary, a salvation to calm the passion.
The share rate has fallen by 75 per cent per EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, the bonding courses were well held.
While the preferential debts were practically not moved, the secondary course of bonds are more significant.
This concerns primarily the bonding former daughter firm W√ºrttemberg Hypo and logically bonded with the period of payment after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally seemed an alternative investment opportunity for speculants, but their stability is needed after a significant increase in the banking crisis and the crisis of the Institute itself, which brought it into the company by Depfa, to understand, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the emission banks, governments and less affected trading banks will be willing to support the system, it is possible to count on reimbursement of securities within their term of payment.
But it can also happen to what is now almost no one daring hope - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time with this partial decline, the probability of the bordering with certainty has now become just an authorised hope.
Especially for long-term creditors, it is likely to prepare a number of nights awake when they decide whether to give up their commitments.
Short-term investors can use the limit line to at least create the transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to rates of later years for the purpose of future tax payments from capital revenues.
Sylvana and secrets of the bento box
When a 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop's first day in Tachiban high school, girls start to chike: that German is completely "cawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from mang, and on her new blog about the exchange stay she talks about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been bailed from my way to school.
I live in the area of Tokia to Kawasaki and ride 40 minutes on a train in Tachibana.
I had to find the road myself, fortunately, I didn't lose myself.
It seems that the beginning of Tachiban's training is not given as strictly as our home in Lower Saska.
Students start meeting after eighth hour and twenty minutes before nineth start a short session with a teacher, namely 'home room'.
But before teaching started, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the type of man who likes to talk before people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I took on my old dress of my host's mom, my blue, blue knee and black skin shoes.
So I stood in front of the lawn and tried to say everything right: "Syonara Wo of Sylvana..." - I'm Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and I'm birthday in a week.
At that point, I was very glad to learn the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were screwing, chichotting and waving, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mangs.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls needed for survival and means "sweet, sweet."
Then I swimmed into my place quickly.
A girl next to me smiled quite wide, considered her honor to sit next to her a foreign student.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong came back, I was literally asleep.
They spoke across each other and chichotated and asked me about the possibly and impossible - but it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Everybody packed up their bench on the break.
My owner's mom also made me a box like that for lunch -- and that's something else than a boring German meal.
I had rice with vegetables, little pairs, corn salad, fruit and some kind of fish in a tofu cake.
I don't even know what I eat here in Japan.
Those things look strange and they taste pretty new.
Surely everything is really good.
Well, maybe just on the salt swings, bro!
Benta in Japan's schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a own-handed bento to the boy, which is particularly artificially modified in this case, and hopes that the boy at the breakfast meets the boy closer.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm curious if I can see it here too.
'Why exactly Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
After all, I prefer to read manga for years.
And to understand these comic books and their culture better, I started learning Japanese once.
So I was absolutely clear that I would have to come here once.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and habits.
And these are highly appreciated here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything's so well organised, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokio is the greatest city I've ever seen."
The rats also have feelings
Does that mean that they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how would they be able to check if they felt the same when they were acting like us?
In the Internet magazine "Edge" has been published for several years of the contributions of famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in his series represents the chosen answer to the question: "What do you think is true without proving it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else yet can prove it if we can't prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we begin to devote to another species and open the issues of perception or general awareness, we enter an incompatible area because the hardware is not in conformity.
When a rat gets in danger, he will do the same thing as many other animals: he'll pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
People act similarly as some scientists consider comparative subjective experiences.
I still don't believe in that.
The two aspects of the brain structure embarrass the transfer of our subjective experience to animals.
It is, however, because the areas associated with human consciousness almost always include a side prefrontal cortex (because of its share in short-term memory and execution or management functions).
This extensive area is developed in humans significantly more than in other primates, and it seems that it is totally missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our awareness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them knowing who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to believe that humans are different from the other primates.
Another dramatic strangeness could hide the linguistic essence of a person: since so much of his perception is connected to the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if the consciousness of the tongue doesn't matter, it would definitely affect it, so the animal consciousness, whatever it is designed, would probably differ from the most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to figure out how awareness is likely for other animals.
When, as an internal and subjective thing, it is not even possible to measure or, because of a special hardware, analyze it based on our own experience, it's a challenge for us.
Most of my findings relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of awareness that should be scientifically easily accessible.
It would be possible to explore animals' processes in awareness regardless of their contents, and exactly what happens in the studies of short-term memory in primates, especially for example of visualization.
But this approach to Christof Koch and Francis Crick focuses rather on the neural coreals of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical but may not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What is the result of feelings?
I bring them out of the fact that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain of aware of its own activity.
So what we call fear is a mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences such as physical reactions) will use the operational memory.
It is seen from this angle, the feelings are closely linked to the areas of the cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially humans.
In conjunction with language nature, a gentle deviation of perception is arising because we can distinguish and categorize the states that we may associate them with others.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that the feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of cortex and the brain tribe devoted to physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain tribe.
Since this network has not changed too much during human evolution, it could be easy to participate in feelings perceived by several animal families.
I can't teoretically resist it, however, I consider it unproofable.
Pankseep argues that what our rats and people seem to be fearful is likely to feel both organisms as well: How is it possible to verify, says Pankseep, if rats and people feel the same when they act similarly?
The swab escapes from danger - does he feel fear too?
In my view, the likelihood of behaviour cannot only prove the compatibility of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison continues to move us: rats and people have similar brain tribes, opposed to the swabs or brains.
But is the brain tribe responsible for feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it to a man, how would we like to prove it at the rats?
I think rats and other insects, perhaps even swabs (who knows?) have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably essentially different from ours (because human consciousness is based on specific areas and languages), I'm rather exploring emotional behavior than emotional sense of rats.
In any case, we can wait for progress at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and people.
Like rats, I don't study language and consciousness, I don't even test my feelings, because I don't know if they exist.
It's possible to think it's short-sight, but I'd rather move forward than throw myself over the wall again.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of EUFA Platini: Midwife for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that preparations will soon be directed by the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the EUFA decision in Bordeaux as a proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to arrange ME with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"It is not amnesty for our country.
Work just started and there's still a lot to do in both countries."
In the early implementation of the time plan of construction or restructuring of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are screwing up.
It's even possible that the number of stadiums for ME will decrease from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We must now work as fast as possible," said the President of the Ukrainian Union, Gregory Surkis.
"EUFA will keep track of us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Union of PZPN was revoked and replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlock after a number of scandals after the National Olympic Committee.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports, Miroslav Drewevski.
He said there is a "value danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," said the Poland press agency PAP.
"The President of EUFA Michel Platini has been assured by a letter that this step will not suffer from preparation for ME 2012."
A number of teams from the first league were only sentenced in the past season for manipulation for forced deployment, and even had to be moved quickly.
Abusive Dennis Quaid returns a hit
She wanted to make a advertisement to a new movie, talking about private things -- and now she has problems with her ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke of her former Dennis Quaid as a divorcer of marriage.
He's mad and he's getting a hit back.
The late rose war with the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce together these two Hollywood actors have a disagreeable dispute - in front of the public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview for the American magazine InStyle last week, first expressed her reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
He said she learned about the scope of fraud until after the divorce.
The incentive for this mental strip was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" -- the story of a distracted marriage.
The reaction of Dennis Quaida to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was meaningful: "It is mad," said a 40-year-old actor of New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews the history of our relationship and edits it."
Furthermore, it's "politationable", that the common 16-year-old son, Jack, again, "is a public reminder of the pain and radical changes for every child's divorce."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a twin father.
He ends his views of prevention as follows: "My life goes on anyway.
I think I'm happy that I have a wonderful family that's doing great."
Airlines and hotel prices are down.
In the first half of 2008, years and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights under one current study were even cheaper to 50 per cent.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have been cheap again - this is the result of a study of the travel and financial services provider of American Express.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made from the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter, it revealed their significant decline in the second quarter.
Since the hotel market prices grew for several years, the accommodation in many places has already elevated.
Since January to March, prices have increased in 41 of the 48 following European cities in the average by 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The most emphasis was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay by 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The reason for this trend is the American Express weak course of a dollar that caused the "declining taste of American tourists to travel".
Hotel price decline was also more affected than industrial centres, such as Hannover, Kolin over Rin or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices by their increase by 26.3 per cent even recorded the European record.
Furthermore, the prices of the airlines showed an increasing trend in the first quarter:
In 2007, the travellers in the Economy class had to pay more than 7.1 per cent in the average than in 2007, even by 29.2 per cent for fuel.
However, from April to June the prices of tickets in the Economy class dropped by a average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, in the Business and First-Class classes were less significant.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11,9 per cent increased, in the second quarter, by 23.6 per cent.
In the German national years, the prices were even down by half according to the quoted study.
One of the reasons for this price fall is slowing economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure because of the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The sign of an intense situation is the disruption of non-profit airlines by air carriers and a high number of airlines that announced the competition in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Glabach 1:0
Thanks to one branch and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets in the head of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to build a working eleven.
Written by Christopher Klein - to increase Unsuccessful landing for representative Marko Marino.
This Glabach player joined the game too late and failed with an exhausted balloon on the stick.
His message was precisely formulated and prompted out of his mouth convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the chambers of the Hamburg Arena.
It didn't happen much in the catacombs, the half-time break ended, and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger was a HSV physiotherapeutic for almost three decades and has more respect than a lot of momental actors.
So his request was also heard in the responsible place.
Coach assistant Cornelius Jol joined and raised his finger on the match mark.
Cornelius is the brother of Chief Coach Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded like this: come here with the other goal!
It didn't happen to be done.
"They weren't looking at everything nice today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
And Bastian Reinhardt would've used to "will he be more relaxed".
For 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers owe the headline of Mladen Petriƒá (11.) and the circumstances that very weak Glabashans couldn't hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," summarized Martin Jol.
The hamburger SV will celebrate this Monday 121 years of its existence.
So, on Saturday afternoon, the divers celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and the lively updated video table on the video wall, where their team was listed as a prime minister.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to assess it," said Marcell Jansen.
He believes that the continuous table result symbolizes rather the unreliableness of the league than the dominants of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Nevesa and Silva, the Brancher of Petrice and from FC Bayern gained by Jansen - is still not able to brighten yet.
"We need more emotional and more dribling," said Jol thoroughly.
After the voting defeat
The Wall Street is spreading fear.
The first reports on the dive of the rescue package caused a decline in the Dow Jones index to 700 points.
That was the biggest loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow picked up something again.
About 20.30 showed this most important world storm barometer of five percent decline to 10.579 units.
The Technological Storm of Nasdaq was more than seven percent in a minus of 1548 points.
The worst was in Dow at this moment, American Express, who lost nearly 14 percent, and the Bank of America lost about twelve percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Goldman Sachs' shares lost almost ten percent.
A few days ago, great investor Warren Buffett had a share in this company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called corrupt hypothetical papers are to be provided.
However, the total amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, it is intended to receive the stock options of financial companies that could be paid in favour of the course, thus reducing the burden for the state budget.
Action courses in Europe fall
Millions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not doubt the investors.
The course of shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly disconnected and downloads the Dax index.
The American Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned relief of the financial market by the state.
The spectacular course losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank broke the index of German shares (Dax) deep into the minus.
The actions mentioned by the monk's real estate fundant lost, despite the rescue of the government and private banks to three quarters of its value, the Commerzbank lost more than 20 per cent.
Dax slipped clearly under the psychologically important limit of 6000 points and recorded 5 839 points with minus 3.7 per cent.
All over the world, stock markets go to knees.
In New York, a business day in Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors are afraid that the US government's rescue package of $700 billion would not have to have an apartment sufficient to restore the event on the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3,3 percent during the first time of trade, and is at 10,809,25 points.
The American House of Representatives has to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate may express the first October.
Other European markets were only in one direction: in London the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 per cent, CAC-40 lost 2.9 per cent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese leader index Nikkei fell by 1.26 per cent to 11 743,61 units.

Business and tourist concern also announced that the shares in the company Thomas Cook would not sell.
Dark Matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have not met one mysterious phenomenon: the dark material has influenced the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravity practice).
Experts are afraid that the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativeity would not have to be completely correct.
Almost 18 years, the Ulysses Space Sonda flyed.
The guilt of fuel leadership that will soon freeze now threatens her death in the winter.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been messed up for years - the anomaly of gravity practice.
Gravity practice is an air maneuver of space probes, where they gain additional flexibility in the gravity field of some space body, such as the Earth.
This means that the probe can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Research Sonda Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sunny Ulysses.
But what the scientist has indicated for years in this case in amazing: flying bodies are not acting 100% as a man would expect by the old good gravity law.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
Sondy are accelerating or slowing unexpectedly.
Physics have failed to explain this effect so far.
He was baptized by gravitational anomal.
Several experts are afraid that even the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativeity, which describes the attraction of the material by the deviation of the space, should not be completely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Promotion Studies in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was wrong and is trying to explain the gravity practice anomaly by means of so-called dark material whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"The responsible for this anomaly could be a dark material that could also be very close to the Earth," he says.
The existence of dark material is known by space researchers for about ten years.
It is obviously a gravity force whose effect on other space bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, she is completely invisible, which means she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, this dark material is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the Italian Minister for Foreign in Egypt said that tourists were kidnapped again on the free.
Sudan kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
The shooter said six kidnappers were killed before release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
The ransom is already running.
The Germans are constantly becoming the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists in Sahara are all free.
Similarly, the Egyptian state television, the Arab Television Station Al-Arabia and the Italian media informed it.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to reports of the Italian TV station Sky TG 24, confirmed the release: "Our co-citizens and other hostages were released.
We are just verifying their health status," Frattini said.
According to Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romania and their eight Egyptian guides are fine and safe.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert are allegedly on their way to Cahira.
Instant remains the background of the shooting before the hostage release: according to the statement of the Egyptian security worker, the kidnappers were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the ransom," said the quoted worker.
He already said, "It was only the hostage to take over," when suddenly the "this surprise" was lost.
Judanese soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and two of them.
The kidnappers asked Germany for a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be transferred by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The "El Masri El Jom" journal, appealing to one of the German mediators, stated that the release of the hostages is stretching because the kidnappers are concerned about their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the hostages of women's sex after paying the ransom.
Men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to speak to this report.
The use of your father "it led to suicide"
A few years of parental abuse led a woman to kill herself, sounded in court.
After confessed to eight cases of sexual distress, seventeenth-year-old Michael Trerise from Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that his own daughter, Stephanie Randle, regularly connected her when she was five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," he wrote to Treris in confession.
The court also stated that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, April 1, 2007, aged 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her and tied her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in the cafeteria.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His own daughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the court, Ms. Randle, who spent a significant part of her time as a volunteer for National Trust organization, was pursued by a spirit of abuse that was committed twice a week.
The prosecutor Ramsey Quaife stated in the court that in 2006 the friends of Ms. Randle, who was also very devoted to surfing and cycling that she was "emotionally dead" and "renounced life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's supposed to be choked with the igelit bag.
Randle stood face to the father of his daughter, who wrote a confession, which ended with the words, "I bound her, and bound her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim, it must have been horrible when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends by taking a victim's life.
Even more horrible is the fact that if she hadn't done so, it would probably not get to trial at all."
"Especially I would like to emphasize the consequences that Stephanie's parents said your crime against their daughter in those years," he added.
Apparently she would be a promising, successful, happy young woman.
The official who lost the data will be accused of
The BBC found out that a government official who left strictly secret documents in the train in June will be accused under the State Secret Act.
The man concerned left two strictly secret documents in the train to Waterloo at the time he was temporaryly assigned to the Defence Ministry.
The documents had reached the hands of the BBC before they were transferred to the police.
It is the least serious violation against the law mentioned, and it does not indicate a criminal intention.
The BBC writer Frank Gardner said that such a move would be a surprise for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter was dealt internally between the Ministry and the Government's Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed shall be accused under Section 8.1 of the relevant law, which is a clause dealing with information protection.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police of the Officer be accused on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Rapporteur Committee (Joint Intelligence Committee).
The documents he forgot contained secret analysis of Al-Qaida and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed on Monday morning and moved from home to an unknown place.
Company reservations face B&B debt
The British Company Reservations may have to deal with more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has provided 2,6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion pounds to protect deposits.
The interests of this loan will be paid by all companies that take customer contributions, including 59 companies' foundations.
The Director-General of the Association of Social Bases (BSA) Adrian Coles said that the reservations and their members must pay.
The 14mm debt will eventually be paid by saving Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that is being paid in the meantime will be paid to all 700 financial companies each year, which take customers' deposits.
The Compensation Plan for Monetary Services for BBC confirmed that all 59 companies are initiated in this number.
It is humiliating that these institutions that have acted carefully... now have to pay some accounts of those institutions that were not so careful from far.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionately to the deposits it held, and that the reserves should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest from debt will increase in 2009 to 450 million pounds.
That means that the reservations will have to find 81 million pounds to pay interests from the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Business Association, said the BBC is convinced that this is not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that have been treated carefully during the breakdown of the apartment market must now pay some accounts of those institutions that were not so careful."
According to BSA, no reservation since 1945, when they appeared, has fallen.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this matter during the next few weeks to see what are the possibilities of protecting the communities and their members from the account that could be substantial," Cole added.
The interest paid in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interest will be paid for the whole year, and that could be almost twice as much.
Since the company stocks are participating organisations without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
The milk will betray for five pens per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey milk announced that since Monday, the price of its milk would increase by five pens per litre.
This year it is the second increase in prices, after a two-pence turmoil in February, and it comes after the research carried out by the advisory company.
Little traders are to decide whether they want to reflect on customers' prices.
Before the increase in February, the high-marketing price of dairy from Jersey last changed in 2002.
Bail for the Bangladesh Expressor is rejected
The Bangladesh Court rejected the request of former Prime Minister Shaich Hassina Vajida for bail release, which means that if she returns to the country, she may be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the accusation that she obtained more than 50 million (729 700 dollars), when she was a prime minister.
The case is one of the several accusations of corruption that are raised against it.
Chalida Ziya, a long-term political rival of Shaich Hasina, was released earlier this month on bail.
Shaich Hassina is to return to Bangladesh during the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), has asked the local army to give her full freedom first.
Writers say that while she was released to the honest word so she could enter a foreign medical procedure, it is not clear if she remains free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say now he appeals to the Supreme Court of Justice.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request of Shaich Hassina for bail with no need of bail when the examination released in abroad is already under way," said her defendant Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall appeal against the Supreme Court of Justice."
Her lawyers claimed that she needed bail to return from abroad to the country for the preparation for December elections.
The High Representative of the People's League said Shaich Hassin was supposed to come home after October 17th.
She was detained last year after the army held by the temporary government took over power, but she was released from prison in June to abroad to a medical procedure.
Shaich Hassin and Chalida Ziya both reject all charges against each other.
Fear of vaccination against defense in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200 000 children have not participated in the recent general vaccination against the armor because of the violence associated with Taliban.
The UN performed vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, he says that for security reasons, she could not reach the children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
The UN spokesman stated that it happened even in spite of the promises of Taliban that thousands of vaccines would not be attacked or stopped at work.
BSkyB lost the ITV court dispute
The BSkyB has lost a judicial dispute on the review of the Commission's competitive decision, which led the company to reduce its share in the ITV competitive broadcast.
The appeal tribunal for the competition of BSkyB ordered to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9 % below 7.5 %.
The Commission has previously declared that the share of BSkyB was a competitive fight and had an inconsecutive impact on ITV.
The BSkyB bought a share in 2006 in a store that prevented NTL, now renamed to Virgin Media, ITV to buy.
In April 2007, the Justice Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of share in ITV by BSkyB has caused doubts about ITV independence and called on the Commission to compete to start an investigation.
The Chief of Consortion Virgin Sir Richard Branson, consumer organisation and regulator of Ofcom were all against buying.
BSkyB argumented that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a disproportionate solution -- particularly because BSkyB said earlier that she was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation of the American attorney's affair
The U.S. Chief State Prosecutor appointed a special prosecutor to examine the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The Tah came in a situation where the report of the afera developed by the High Inspector of Justice of the Ministry of Justice criticised the activities of government officials.
The report criticised officials of the White House, the legislator and the former Minister of Justice Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was incited by fear that the lawyers were removed for political reasons.
The Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers who were interrogated during the investigation lied to investigators in order to marry justice.
In the report, General Inspector Glenn Fine stated: "The serious orders, including the potential criminal proceedings, have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the US Ministry of Justice removed nine American lawyers in December 2006 by their functions.
At that time, the Ministry stated that lawyers were released for weak performance.
But later it turned out that the release of the lawyers was not estimated worse than many of their colleagues, which led to the conclusion that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of highly built republic ambassadors and senators, others refused to investigate the accusations of the deception of the voters raised against the Democrats.
American attorneys are investigating and prosecuting lawsuits for the government.
They may be released any time but should not be removed for political reasons.
The head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, got under fire for release and finally resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The report of the General Inspector expressed very critically in terms of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying that he had "main responsibility" for release, "abdicated" from his leading position and "no" in the event.
Other officials, including former High Bush advisor Karl Rove, were criticised for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's commander will be evaluated
The Rock Star Meat Loaf gets one of the Q Awards for his epical Hymna Bat Out of Hell.
A singer who came to the ceremony for his special gold price next weekend in London said he was "honored" by acquired recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and 50 seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's hit album in 1977.
The nomination for this year is run by the Coldplay group, which has arrived in four categories.
Paul Rees, chief editor of the Magazine Q, said, "There are some songs that stand over such things, like time and genre, and Bat Out of Hell is certainly one of them."
A song written by Jim Steinman needed big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It started with an instrumental part that took almost two minutes.
The song was published in Britain in 1979 as a singl and reached the fifteenth place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out of Hell was held in the ladder for about nine years and sold over 40 million copies around the world.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered in recent years of health problems, was also operated in 2003 because of an irregular heart rhythm after he collapsed on the stage.
In 2007, acute laringitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
Later, it turns out he had a cyst on the rumors.
Cover streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon to sell
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, roads and other land communications, some famous, other only users.
But even many veteran taxiers and long-year locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they never heard of it.
This little street is in the neighborhood of East Village and leads north from the First Street - without getting on the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and forty meters length, it is more like a screwed passage than a traffic move.
There are no tags with street names.
She's practically invisible in the common atlas.
Still, the street has a fan.
For example, the company Avalon Bay, the developer of recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
Extra Place wants to reinforce and create a cleaner passage to shops and botics that should be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are the long-term neighbours who say that they were shortly charmed by the street just because it was one of the last remains of the time the block was earmarked.
However, the city's Office for Protection and Development of the Facility, which has the street in its power, is not the least interested in sticking with it.
At the meeting of the General Community Land Committee, the representatives of the city office and the Avalon Bay plan planned to buy a street developer.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, circuit manager of the General Community 3, the Committee prefers a variety where the street remains in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns a very few lands, and we would like the Extra Place to remain in its property," she said.
"The proposals for repair and management could be submitted, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to make the small street a new way and plant places for a seating, from which several would use a caf√© whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at the meeting this month.
Michel de Milly, speaker Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to fix this empty street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale proposed the city.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the Office for Conservation of Buildings, said that the city really wanted to sell the streets, and underlined that the task of his office was to develop property rather than to manage.
In comparison with his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a small trail in history.
Some people think that the street was given its name in 1802, when the large farm of Philip Minthorn was divided between several of his children and that tight strip of the country, no one had a privilege.
The Extra Place led the back door of CBGB, a puncrock monument that closed in 2006, and the street may be the most famous as the background of the photograph on the album group Ramones "Rocket to Russia".
"This place was amazing," said Danny Fields, manager Ramones, who photographed in November 1976.
"There were wasteful, broken clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some local, including bloggers who write about the exploitation of the East Village quarter, are confronted with the idea to sell Extra Place and claim that the piece of public property, being inclined, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a raritum - almost unchanged piece of town that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog named Jeremiah's disappearing New York (with the subtitle "The Book of Mounts: bitter nostalgic view of the city in the extinction process"), hanged part of the story of Extra Place from the series Talk about the city that appeared in the newspaper The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind street, dark and dark in the day, and limited to cutting iron doors of the warehouses and smashed windows, where a week of old papers are chasing in the streams."
Except for a few exceptions, the street of one last night looked exactly the same.
The rat ran through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, whose place today is a costly shop.
There were graffitis on the wall and there was an empty bottle of beer next to the fresh dose of the newspapers.
A couple of circuits said that the Extra Place thoughts were a little bit, but suggested that he could use some resistance.
On the contrary, Fields said they think some people underestimate the impression of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "was in the dark, wet and disgusting places."
Debate on billingability: Diving to English
In this edition, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for billing education.
Lance T. Izumi, academic worker from California and director of education in the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-autor of the book "Worder than you think: why the middle class needs to choose schools."
Effectively addressing Spanish electorals is an embarrassing matter.
The education agenda of Baracka Obama just proves it.
Obama's campaign underscores that "Afro-American and Spanish students have a significantly lower probability that they are more than white students," which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, it promotes Obama's educational agenda, particularly, for "transitional bilingual education" for those who are yet learning English.
However, the question of Baracka Obama is whether his commitment to billing education, which stresses the use of languages in class other than English, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Let's take the Sixth Street Prep, Charter Basic School in Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are totally Spanish from low-profit families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have arrived recently, are only learning English.
Even though, in the 2008 state mathematics tests, 100 percent of fourth class students reached the highest level.
Almost the same amazing ninety - three percent of the fourth - class students reached the highest level in the state tests from English and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by another method that Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and exercise, continuous evaluation of skills and access without excuses.
In addition, Obama should note that, according to Linda Michaels, director Sixth Street, is a school educational approach for those who only learn English, "a complete diversion."
The diving into English emphasizes nearly the expensive use of English in learning.
Ms. Michaels, who's against Billing's education, said to me, "We've had a great success with a totally new student from Mexico -- after 12 months, you'd have entered the class and not know what it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model, how should other schools look with great shares of Spanish and English learning students?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own parties (National Education Association is a long-term supporter of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for double-lingual education impairs the prediction of Obam's response.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter when he said that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wishes to delete the performance differences, he should rather consider educational models that work, carefully thinking than laughing and trivializing them.
The rape falls sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices in Monday drastically fell due to the fear that the American plan for saving financial markets would not have to restore the economy.
The prices of the term oil trade dropped in the morning trading on the New York Commodity Bureau to 7% to 99.80 dollars per barrel.
Since last Monday, the prices fell by more than $20 for a barrel.
In the past two weeks, the commodity markets were shaken by financial disturbances in Wall Street and two strong hurricanes in the Mexican Gulf.
After reaching maxim 145,29 dollars for a barrel in July, the prices dropped earlier this month to almost 90 dollars for a barrel, while again jumped on the wave of the huge financial insecurity.
The investors reappeared on Monday, even after the President of the Congress announced that the weekend had reached an agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report has been shaded by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from the end.
In the latest episode of a progressive divorce, the government announced that the Citigroup Group would buy the banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg government partially declined the European financial conglomerat Fortis.
The Barclays Capital analysts said that the creepy weekend meetings that led to the economic salvation plan "seem to be incapable to rebuild the mood on the market".
As the economic situation gets worse, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to fall down.
"Inspections for markets with global stocks, interest rates and currency courses have been strongly detected," analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote in the report to investors.
"We believe that the commodities will not be able to escape the diseases.
From a commodity perspective, our greatest concern is how much the American virus will spread across the world and especially to China."
The bank's analysts limited their expectations to the next year, since oil consumption fell due to slower growth in the economy, and reduced their predictions of gasoline prices for 2009 by about 20%.
Wild ride in the second quarter over the team's record
After he spent the last eight seasons more than anyone else, Shaun Ellis' defensive player thought he'd already seen everything.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter where Jets converted the wireless game into a spanished ride.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizonian Cardinals equipped their grieving game with the dark clouds over them.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues Colese to a 12-yard touchdown sprint, which perfectly predicted the afternoon, where their gradually developing cooperation moved a mile ahead.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter to another two touchdowns, including the one in which he fell cornerback, and the next 10 seconds before the half of the match.
"It was nothing extraordinary," Favre said about all his extracts to Coles.
"He's a damn good player.
We had a great communication, whatever people think."
While Favre and Coles were throwing away, the defense attacked Cardinals Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a broken shot and returned him 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith tipped another recording and caught it.
The linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced was perhaps the best.
The Cardinals team got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely diged a 20-yard goal from the field, which won the lead of 34-0.
That's the biggest thing Jets ever got in one quarter.
Coach Jets Eric Mangini, when he was invited to describe that madness, he said, "A second quarter or a third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points in third quarter without answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
A lot of points fell in a short time segment."
Restless Gebreselasia improved its world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia again showed why many view him as the best remote runner at all when he overcome his own world record on Sunday in Berlin‚Äôs marathon and became the first man who ran 26.2 miles of a long race under two hours and four minutes.
With a victory on a pleasant flat track in time 2:03:59 he converted his preceding time 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselasia, 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - overcome the world's record or at least the world's master at all distances from a metric mile to a maraton.
Last month, Gebreselasia missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because he was afraid - from the backward view maybe too scared - that the polluted air would irritate his problems with the asthma.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - solar and 48 degrees on launch, 55 degrees in the target - he won Gebreselasia on Sunday with a 4-minute average and 43 seconds per mile.
As the runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Keny focused on a longer trail, the Marathon record fell in the last decade by more than two minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the Sunday victory, he told Gebreselasia to the journalists that he had two weeks ago screwed in the litter and left a week of training.
The break obviously bothered him rather than delayed.
"I'm so happy," said Gebreselasia to the reporters.
"All was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little doubty today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - because he said he was too much planning his races, generally avoiding world maraton peaks, relying on guides, as if it was a race on the road, and building world records over the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's huge running quality.
Maintened at the rate of four Kenyans reached Gebreselasia half in time 1:02:04.
After the leaders dropped away, Gebreselassie was persecuted by two elite Kenian runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little before three miles before the aim of Gebreselasia last took and escaped Kwambai, who then ran second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi ended third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitenk, a parent of Kazakhstan, who is now German citizenship.
Record Time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Sixty-five-year-old Mikitenk won a surprise last spring in London marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed the Peking game because of something that was described as a back wound, but she recovered and won in Berlin and the third marathon that she had ever run, improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let the ethiopic and Kenyan runners escape to a great step, and then she reached about 18,2 miles [18,2 km].
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia ended the second in 2:21:31 and Helene Cypropova from Keni ended third at 2:25:01.
The pride and obstacles of the life of black people in a separate city
Hidden between the greatest entertainment parks of the larger Orlando, several miles away from all shiny, loud and gross, lies a quiet city in which pride and the difficulty of African American life.
Eatonville, the first entirely black town that was included in the state and where the Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is not as easy as she described in 1935: "The place of five lakes, three croquet fields, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough quay, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a passing place.
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Jeonville festival of the Dawn! to present the gift of Hurston, the most famous woman writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains aside, even though she made a stop for tourists by incorporating it into a florid tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the period of economic crisis.
It's still as independent, dignity and privacy as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black people in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "knows about us so little that they don't even know what it's going on."
Even today, in the year when the Montenegro presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on races, many of the inhabitants remain careful about the views of foreigners.
"We pay great attention to how our story is stored," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here since the birth and is a member of the oldest farness in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It's like a historic model of black growth, and a community of nearly 2400 people, where poverty rate is double against the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also a shadow example of the Southern rural black culture - sometimes disregarded, sometimes famous - which came from American slavery.
It's not too surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and protective.
And the concern about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through the heart books full of men like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (their eyes were watching God)" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florid Tourist Guide changed a city of pieces into road 17, which leads through the frequently displaced center of Florida, in the stage of the black history and human drama.
With the examination of a big drum in her life and literature, Hurston‚Äôs reader introduced to the store of the first Jeonville Mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"Left next to the road," she wrote, "is a white brown decorated modern national school with well maintained courts and fields that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can't read or write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits in the clock hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston Eatonville connected with self-management, but also with illiteracy, reconciliation of marriages and sex.
This apparently wasn't a typical Fodor's manufacturer.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"The dawn said it as it was," says the nineteen-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who made Hurstone immortal by quoting men who sang of their beauty singing pure songs.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston still remembers a chiper embarrassment that she often returned after her family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
Seventy - seven - year - old Augustus Franklin remembers that mostly, when she crashed into the city, she arrived in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in the city, which is proud of the dignity of clothing today.
Most of the inhabitants were fascinated, Franklin said, but a lot of people were screwed up.
"The people of Zora always loved to see," said Franklin.
But, he added, swinging on a chair at the back terrace with a view to the lake of Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "without ever stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were expelled from the press.
It seemed that Eatonville and the rest of the world forgot about her.
Although she was once a literary star, the current Langstone Hughes and the only black girl at Barnard College in the twentieth century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in the Florid Fort Pierce, where she lived earlier.
In Eatonville, there were no bigger sad ceremonies or great public readings.
"I don't think they understood her meaning for the world or her reference at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the biography of Hurston, "Wrapped in Rainbows (Packed in spirits)" published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
The representatives of the County of Orange wanted to stretch the city by a five-road road instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local bipower of the main road.
Orland's explosion has already pushed the inter-State road 4 across the west edge of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still coming from a complex historical period.
Needed integration, along with other things, ended relatively idylic isolation of this community.
In the 50s of the 20th century, the struggle for the mixing of races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"In that time, a band of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things on people who sat on the side," said Franklin.
"We actually had a lady who killed it.
They walked out of the car."
In the 1955 Journal of The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the requirement of the highest court of forced integration and its decision in the case of Brown versus the educational chamber, she declared "for my race it is more insulting than celebrating."
The inhabitants now claim that the desegregation of schools, even though in some areas was positive, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermine the courage of this youth.
"The black children were used to hugs - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher tonight," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter Ellie Dinkins and the executive director of the non-profit group Reserve the Eatonville Community (Save the Eatonville Community).
It took time until teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You don't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher -- I mean, there's a cultural barrier there," Ms. Nathiriov√° said.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many other Zors Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, raised themselves above prejudices with mild self-conscious and quoted, such as "How can someone perceive the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to the unmarked grave of Hurston and began fighting for renewing her reputation.
Five years later, the bookstones were found in a commendable biography of Hurston from Robert E. Hemenway, who reinstated her into the American Canon.
The road project arrived just the moment the most famous daughter of Eatonville recovered the lights of the ramp.
The former neighbours of Hurston now considered her a rescue.
In order to show what can happen to the road, the community began to plan the Hurston festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inauguration action two years later, and every January many return to the celebration.
The state, after a few years, retired from the road proposal.
"Their five railway railways were resurrected, you would say that it directly exploded the real civil pride," Nathiriov√° said.
Boyd said it easier, "The dawn saved Eatonville."
Victory over the road project helped to change the image of the city.
The outside towns like Rachel Munson, a lawyer who began to attend this church in 1993, began to appear in a larger number, and the inhabitants began to reconsidere the past.
Eatonville joined the National History Register in 1998.
The new one floor library (of course named after Hurston) was opened in 2006 on the re-asfalted and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today Eatonville remains a florid anomaly: only six miles from the center of Orlanda can sometimes act as a fallen street in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Day is 90 percent black.)
With strangers who come to look for the story and the meaning of Eatonville, they are often treated carefully.
The permission for most interviews is necessary to have in advance and certain things - like wall paintings in the oldest Yeonville church that are painted by white people and which show black people in the fields - can't be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, courageous, self-confided teacher who likes red, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be correctly understood.
And even as Hurston's festival increased, home pride has also increased.
Especially young people seek to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and equally proud, creative, working, foolish and diversity as other American races and ethnics.
From Franklin's nephew's voice, an eighteen-year-old Edwin Harvey, he recognizes the true love of the community when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or in the police he says she'd enjoy some help.
And even younger, like 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kennonova, seemed to have learned to describe Eatonville right.
"Most people, if they just walk this way, think, 'Hm, this town is nothing against the others," said Alondra Kenon recently Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York we all speak gas financially.
At first, nothing has changed here.
If tourists on Manhattan stayed away from the news stations and the giant TV screens on Times Square, they would not realize that they were standing in the middle of the storm.
They would never agree that in a glass bird of offices over their heads, bankers and managers of investment funds that monopolyze New York, the worst "worst day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still scratching the metal cart along the walkers and carrying muffins to breakfast.
The Spanish continue to move between the towers and wear, like human mules, 50 scratched shirts hanging from waves on their backs.
The office rats are still waiting in front of their morning bagel at the street dining stations, and it is still impossible to gather a yellow taxi day between fourth and seventh afternoon.
It didn't seem at all like a crisis until, with all the talks about pessimism, I decided to set up on Thursday afternoon.
Although I've timed this task to cover up with a late afternoon sit on my local office JP Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people waiting in the queue.
Not before treasure windows to pick up or store cash, but before the cross, where older customers order check books, tourists ask for the way to trade with the mixed goods of Macy's and new customers start accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason as I did.
However, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they arrived, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called thrifts (a little similar to construction competitors), monetary communities and of those types of companions whose branches operate only in one country, and who claim to care for their customers as family.
In the past year, 15 such banks broke down.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets for $327 billion, went to the audience, and when the New Yorkers returned home on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with assets for $440 billion, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
The employees of offices and businesses who were standing in front of me and fearing another collapse, moved their cash to the bank, which is considered as a safe port and which makes most rescue on Wall Street.
The ordinary New Yorkers learned gas finance in the last week.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket talked to the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, that broken bank, and to her ruined top-professional worker Dick Fuld with a family-familiarity as if she was talking about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed 50-year-old housekeeper of my gin, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food supply.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in the cash market funds.
I moved it, I won't risk it."
Muslim graves disappointed by Austrian right fracture
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian right side of Frees and Philip Dewinter from the Belgian Right Party Vlaams Belang attended the manifestation presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 by the organization "The City against Islamization".
They do not contain characters similar to the transport marks showing the meats crossed by the red line.
The police accuse the right extremists of the degradation of the Muslim cemetery in Austria of the same weekend where extremely right parties have achieved enormous profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves on the graveyard in the city of Traun near Linze were sometimes severely destroyed between Friday evening and this morning, and the police are convinced that it was an organized action.
The perpetrators fought for some graves of Jewish symbols, such as David‚Äôs star, but the detectives are convinced that this could be an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred to the Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear whether this incident was connected to the elections.
The speaker of the Islamic communities here said that they are "deeply shocked" by the reports of inhabitance coming at the time the end of the Muslim post moon, Ramadan.
Austria, meanwhile, enters the circle of searching for its own soul after the traffic went on yesterday in parliamentary elections.
Both extremely right parties, which have gained more than 30 per cent of the votes together, the Frees and the Union for the Future of Austria, have led a vegetationally anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans have been condemned as xenophobic criticians.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the Free Party, who won over 18 percent of the votes, protested against the sheets and burkes in the campaign, and even expressed his resistance to foods with a view to the relationship with Islam.
At the last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he spoke about "European Brotherhood", which is to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prohibit the construction of minerals and are argumenting that these are political symbols of islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analysis carried out immediately after elections that have built extreme right to the position of the strongest political bloc in the country suggest that this change has been caused in particular by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter must not travel abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star, who was convicted for sexual abuse of children, forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
The officials issued this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he plans to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police was authorized last Thursday after she handed the evidence to the officials of Glitter's previous judgments for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, named Paul Gadd, was not attended at the lowest criminal court of Ashford in Kent, but represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
He said: "On Thursday 25 September the lowest criminal court of Ashford requested the Kent police to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the borders to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd didn't attend personally."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel to abroad, how it stored his record in the sexual assault register.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
It also has to transmit the scheduled date of departure to the police for a week in advance.
If he noticed his obligation to inform the authorities, he could be convicted for five years.
The Kent police announced that they would not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible routes across the district.
Kent's speaker's police said, "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our perspective, it is easier to watch someone who remains in Britain, because there are large systems that manage potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kent's people is the highest priority for Kent police and we work carefully to monitor the behaviour of recorded sexual attackers so that we reduce any danger to the public to a minimum."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after he spent 27 months in Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to fly to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and he refused to leave London.
The Thai authorities did not let him pass passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22th, he finally arrived at the heathrow terminal 3 and remained there, while his legal representative David Corker went to Uxbridg's lowest criminal court in Western London, and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully asked him to register as a sexual assaulter.
Glitter was previously detained in the United Kingdom for four months for the property of child pornography.
The source from the Ministry of Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of Interior, was calm and glad that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To catch the real nature, I photograph a master outside the scene." G√ºnther Bauer - photographer
No shoes, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenca, separated from concentrating on interpretation - just so I'm going to target the relaxed expression of a man or woman.
On one side of the artist.
The second is a man.
Inseparable, if we pass privately, in those moments away from the audience - then a confidential gesture can be seen, a depth of a summerly caught view or a passionate gesture of hands that are careless because they are not going to come up on the scene.
The German G√ºnther Bauer is in the "Flamenco-people" theatricality of theater with singers, dancing and guitarists with the less familiar face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer comprises a unique iconography of flamenca from different environments.
The exhibition that takes place within the Moon Photography of Flamenca (Mes de la Photograph√≠a Flamenca), "reflects the growing international meaning of flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people, but when you look at the photographs, you find that these are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people portraited "on the street" are artists capable of transferring passion, sadness, joy... and completely capture the watchers.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to photograph at the stage.
He's wearing his personality and character inside.
I was wondering to create a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to catch the personality of the giant flamenca.
The charmed festival "Cante de las Minas" started Bauer in 1997 a long way to portrait flamenc singers, guitarists and dancemen on the screen camera.
These are portraits that, by selecting cameras and materials, look like a classic photograph.
The application of different styles is in contrast with the classic base of the picture and borrows the present spirit, which is the idea that Bauer itself reflects and flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but does not stop surprise and develop."
What takes off the watchers is not the effect of the dance itself, singing or games, but the personality and nature of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet the most important, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experience, it was and is the constant work presented during these days in the El Photomate gallery.
This choice forms known flamenca figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project has become some kind of flamenca antology and will soon be accompanied by a book edition that will contain exhibited portraits.
The perception for portrait has brought Bauer to the idea of repeating the "Portrate sports veteran" (SportARTproject).
Although their concept of "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "foot people, recognize them and have a chance for a moment, whether longer or just short, enter their lives - that's my passion.
I think the photograph is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or encounters people, individuals that sometimes don't even know, or give him a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, I always try to realize my imaginations."
The collection of present flamenco portraits called "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the El Photomata Gallery in de la Mata 20, equivalent to Alameda de Hercules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel that he wrote is "badness"
It is happening in the environment that he has not yet known, and is talking about events for his strangers, but Mario Vargas Llosa is going to successfully implement its new project - he is currently working on a novel, whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived 20 years in Congo and traveled even in Amazon.
The eternal favorite of the Nobel Price for Literature yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia festival confessed that the project that is currently employing him is "a triumphment", and that "all suggests that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had reason, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe that I will end it once," he finished his contribution to the exchange festival of ideas, thoughts and words, which during four days saw in the city of the aquaduct around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "Mest and Dogs" was one of the main figures of the third year of the word's celebration and fulfilled the expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival price for the most favorite writer - old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled theatre Juan Bravo in the last place.
With Felix Rome, who introduced him, he had a satisfactioned audience, who had an hour running as a water - Peruan with amazing precision and a notable dose of humor, remembering him from the original "incredible adventure" from "the pleasure of a passionate reader" and of "power to live more than I lived" borne a literary mission; as complemented by "independence of inspiration" by writing "disciplinated", carefully repairing text, repairing and overwriting; or as they influenced his writing, Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what "rememorable images" are the nose base of his stories.
Hispano American writer admitted that "there is no way", how to find out whether and how many books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just entertainment, void experience" -- he stressed Vargas Llosa by saying that he "to people act" and "force them to turn away from the row," and called the writers to "do not take responsibility" of their mission.
Climateology loses the celebration in Zooblanco - missing spears
The exhibition of spears closed in Zooblanco yesterday morning was cancelled after a confirmation of an effective notification that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
That's why the company, along with Fermin Bohorkquez, Pable Hermos de Mendoza and Leonard Hernandez, decided to cancel the bullshit matches.
The inappropriate meteorological conditions suffice this celebration for a long time, and two of the three celebration could not be fulfilled.
On Saturday, the rain deprived the progress of the other planned bull matches.
During them, the formation of Jos√© Luis Moreno, Curro D√≠az and Juan Bautista should be constructed by bulls in the arena in Castillan.
But it was only on Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and rewards for dynamic and estetically quality performance was taken on his shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante replaced two wounds with spears for greetings and one ear that brought him rather uncovered seats in the arena than the toreador art.
The worse was El Julia, who walked through the bike arena of Los Llanos unsalted.
In the second round of the woods without a single breath, he has received a sharp criticism since the majority of the population.
They ran checks in Alawa in the van with 2,000 pounds of hashish
In ten minutes, five.
Road control of Ertzaintz in the city area Armi√±on (Alava).
The applicants stop two people riding in the van, and they want them.
The cost, more than two tons of hashish, is not to stop.
According to the report of the Committee of the Interior of the Basket Government, members persecuted and detained one of the drivers in the van, a man aged 38, identified as A.A.J.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and fake public documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road checks on N-1 in places where the border of the city area of Armi√±on.
They were going to stop the van for control, but the driver did not follow the instructions, speeded up and run.
The car operators began to pursue immediately, when the vehicle stopped a few miles away from the peak, both passengers jumped up and fled into a forest growth.
Ertzaintzy's suppliers finally reached one of them and took 2 178 pounds of hashish, which suspects transported, as it appeared when the Iveco Daily surveillance was searched.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with packages of hashis which were subsequently transported to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighting.
Furthermore, the police found that the marking is "cluttered" and does not agree with the data listed in the supplies documents, the detained was therefore accused of fake public documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect who, as mentioned earlier, managed to escape so as to finally determine the origin of the drug captured.
The detained A.A.J., 28 years old, was transferred to the police department to fix the relevant formalities before they approach the next investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear detained under the influence of medication
The actress Heather Locklear, the favorite Amanda from Melrose Place, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her performing unusual maneuvers when she tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito, informed the magazine People speaker of the California road patrol.
The Witness stated that about 16.30 hours. Locklear "whispered on the gas, dried in the loud barking in front and back and tried to leave the parking spot -- she took the sunglasses several times when she wandered."
The Witness, who probably didn't know the actress first, saw Locklear a moment after stopping on the nearby road and coming out of the vehicle.
This person also warned the rescue service because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police guard arrived, she found a actress inside the vehicle that partially blocked the cart.
"She seemed disoriented," and that's why the members took her to a specialized drug and alcoholic center to be subjected to the test.
According to the police speaker, the actress cooperated and the excessive amount of alcohol was excluded at once, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was obvious to the officers at first sight."
Locklear was detained for suspicion of the impact of the effects of the unspecified substance and was taken to custody around 1900, even though she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from the treatment clinic, where she was recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists on the angelic IU association to apply its powers in the Sylva Case
General Chief of IU and Member for the United Left Gaspar Llamazares announced today that the final decision in the cause of the former Council Committee of Youth and the sports of the Council in Seville Francisca Manuela Silva, who left the office last week after he was accused of the proceedings for his family, will depend on the district association of the party.
"I'm a too much federalist, it's an angelic organization to apply its powers," the Llamazares noted the negotiations to which the party will have to step towards the former member of the Sevil City Council.
The Chief of IU, however, insisted that in the case of an investigation of the illegal proceedings that Silva has committed, it is absolutely necessary "transparency": "IU has always fought for such matters to be maximum transparency."
He also emphasized that the party has a "strict ethical code for all public functions".
"Twitter Blood" ('Sangre de Mayo'), Garcia's epic bet
Jos√© Luis Garci in the film "Flower Blood" (Sangre de Mayo), which was inspired by the Episode of the National History of Benita Pereze Galdose, restores the famous rebellion of the Spanish against the French - this is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the film creator wanted to "implement the expression of figures and analyses of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarr√≠a during the presentation of the picture before a large team of interpreters.
The May Blood with a metrage over two and a half hours will be placed in the movies this Friday and in the future there will be more than four-hour television series for Telemadrid.
As a great fan of the literary creation of Galdose Jos√© Luis Garci claims that the film fulfilled the "child dream", for which Esperanza Aguirre owed him three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid to take a picture on the twoth anniversary of Madrid 2 May, he accepted the offer that the story would come from the Epizode of the National History.
The budget of 15 million, fully contributed to the Madrid Province, means Garcia's "one opportunity" to create an environment with culiss and costumes suitable to the image of "Spain Shooting, which was wrong in the leader for whom it was fighting - the fight for independence led for the Government of Ferdinand VII to the decline and deficiency of the country," he stated.
But the director regrets that he can't count on the financial support that came to the films The Sad wing (Ala triste) or Goy's spirits - almost double of the May's Blood - so he couldn't record some scenes from the scene signed at the same time by Horatio Valcarcel, with whom he works almost all over his film track.
The film director "Restart again" (Volver and Empezar) works as he is normally used - on the scene with the actors with whom he usually tests before filming and which he does not choose by casting, because it seems "happy" and also believes that "the part of the director's call is, inter alia, to go to the theatre and the movies, and so learn what happens in the work he's dealing with".
Many of the players he chose for May's Blood are already appearing in front of his camera, such as Miguel Rellan, Carlos Larra√±aga, or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Garci with four nominations to Oscar, one of whom he gained, is the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the same May Blood, the Seven tables of the French Billier and the last selected Blind Sun, represents the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "she's just going to appear."
Garcia doesn't expect any appreciation for this film.
"You think at first you're working for what's going to happen, but then you realize that you're only working for the salary, so you'll be able to do another more movie," Garcia explains with more than 30 years of directing career.
Isabel Bayon renews a spiritual reference to Sevilla Dancer Tortola Valencia
Sevill's flamenca dancer will give up the other Sevilla dance.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, from the father of Catalan (Floren√ß Tortola Ferrer) and the mothers of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and when she was three years old, she and her family moved to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on the oriental dance.
She had a life full of passion, a pioneer of a woman's emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a buddhist and vegetarian and fought for abolishing the corzet that prevented women to move freely.
The life of this woman affected by the dance and aesthetic revolution of the Isabel Bayon International Europe.
"I wanted to work with Pepo Gamboa, and she proposed this figure to me - it seemed unbelievable."
According to the dancer, "we're not about telling her life, we're about the capture of the soul.
The names of her dancing show reminded me of the flamenco rhythms.
So "baby dance" evolved my guajira or "the snake dance" some kind of tanga.
Her dance was sensitive and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic is also answering," she said.
The presentation is counted by the involvement of two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Vedou, who will sing in one show as in "Open Doors" (La Puerta Aberita), and with the teacher of Matilde Coral, who made an exception and joined her former hook.
"Matilde represents the senior Tortol, a mature figure.
I'm happy she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honour to me."
It also counts on music and guitars of Jesus Torres and Paca Arriagy, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Moron; the El Pajara drums, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of the actress Juanfry Juarez, who has the role of an eternal guide of this kind of artist who are primadons with all and who are always in love with them.
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who was taking place in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, and all over Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think she was one of those women who have a huge influence at some time, but today no one knows her and yet less appreciates her creation," Bayon says.
The show begins today at 20:30 at Lope de Vega theatre.
The book "Free Day of Married" also closes the trienales
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "Saint Stephen's Church" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez closed a marriage with Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Culture Council of the autonomous angelian government to celebrate "Trinale Zenobya and Juan Ram√≥n" (2006-2008), held in order to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel price for literature and their anniversary.
"Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n's Trienale" are about to end with the new edition of this work, an international convention to be held in New York, repairing the Nobel Museum House and travel exhibition "Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez: Onen sunlight", which was opened in May this year, and after rounding the various angelic provinces, it should be planned to move to New York at the time of the convention.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andaluian Government also ordered eight hundred prints of the "Frestly married Day" edited by Peder Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Perez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of personality and the works of one of the world's angelic poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like herself so much anymore.
"God sometimes creates perfect humans.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of the actress Sally Field, who cooperated with him on "No evil intention" and under the difficulty of awareness that Newman left, reveals his unconsolved vision of abandoned American movies and all of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And he was retired since 2007.
And that he knew he was hardly sick.
Still, he was a boy for everyone.
"Every time what a person feels can't be expressed in no way, and I've lost a great friend now," said Robert Redford in the tears, "my life and my country were better because of him."
No one was afraid he'd be ridiculous or exaggerated.
The father of the movie and the country died in particularly a dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, when American self-consciousness is at the bottom of the desperate seeking reasons for pride.
When the time is rough and people without virtue and just a bunch of those who are worth your admiration, there's no need to be Louis Cernud to love Paul Newman.
For all, he had a nearly platonical ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a warrior for losing and winning cases, from the foundation against drug addiction based on the honor of the firstborn son who died of overdose, after his own mark of domestic food and biofood.
A full treasure for a country that cost a lot of effort to forgive the suicide food culture.
The violent wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, said that not one man died but a whole era.
Another Englishman, Oskar's director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was a top of his career.
Bad boy from Australia, Russell Crow, to mark Newman's trouffle as his largest source of inspiration.
"This leather has put a pretty high patch on us all," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the small ones who today have the courage to try to live like Paul Newman -- based on honesty and leading a serious privacy life far from the cameras.
It's not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, there are people like that and Paul Newman is their pattern.
He divorced once, and since then he was married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, who was loyal, even though he had a lot more than a chance to be.
"Why should I go out to a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him in heaven be proud that there is a controversy between his daughters and the admirers on earth - in America, it is not too common.
It is said that "of all the great roles he had made, he was the most proud of the role of a loyal husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a sacrificed philanthrope."
Imperfect races in Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us want the olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the 2012 unsuccessful, it may be 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we're going to the race yesterday, I'm saying no!
It was spoken of him as a perfect race, and according to my judgment, he was the worst I've ever been on.
Such a snake of nonsense that right now, if there was an assessment and I was testing, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's take a look at it from the beginning, pretty one at a time.
The nonsense begins with a racing number that makes a man run early.
It doesn't seem bad to me, but when a man goes there, let them give him everything (including a chip that is to prevent the transmission of the road).
Oh, no.
Here a man must have first picked up a number (the first nonsense, go there only for it) and (after the arrival of the right front) - what a surprise! - they only had a S shirt size (second nonsense, because I need XL size).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis they decided to buy only small shirts, because it's less substance and they're cheaper?
Okay, well, that's a little bit compared to what was happening on the day of the race.
Except that it had to go very soon for the chip and the front insisted on him for more than 15 minutes, there had to be a backpack.
For more than 35 minutes there was a waiting time, which is on the race where 11,000 people are expected, something unbelievable.
So, as it could be expected, the race started, and we haven't put our bags yet, and when it was done, it was much worse with the pickup.
Furthermore, the waiting extended 40 minutes of rain, leading to a general rebellion and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have an inflammation tomorrow, and some like me will not show the right time in assessing the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I suppose, I didn't have the right time to start.
Of course, if someone asked me about some perfect race, this one wouldn't have thought of me.
So I think we're just gonna have to keep a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is searching for reception (virtual)
At a conference on new technologies, MIT has introduced Microsoft further development in a new system of recognition of images and human interactions in the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but capable of carrying out basic activities as calling taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move around the entire area of society) and seeing what he hears in the conversation.
Thanks to the camera and system that recognises forms and faces, this "reception" can find out how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
He can also distribute the present according to the conversation groups.
On the demonstration video, the reception records a third person and understands that it is not part of the group that talks to her and that he is not a company employee.
She asks if she's going to see someone, and she tells her she'll be dedicated to her in a moment.
It's all without a blue death screen.
Excellent.
But of course it's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, for example, a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week there was a lot to talk about the change in Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial use, they would be five times more powerful - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
The discovery as a thunder when we consider that Microsoft version of the version adds new functions to Windows and another "extra".
A change in direction would be a credit act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system slowly loses its meaning and is also software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who were adhering to the theory that this was the first Googlu step to competitive competition with Windows.
Many have justified that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the necessary layer to understand between the hardware and the software.
He has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the tchyni.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think about "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth, but relative to the truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system and on the contrary to more web browsers.
The computer is enabled to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time every day on the Internet than around the windows.
What does half of the applications carry out to the system for?
There's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less difficult, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here I have a little example.
I took this photo in a recreational room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the drinking machine that asked them to use their search tools: "Your search, our future."
In 2006, independent studies showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used to search Google.
By the way, a new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count until 2010.
In Microsoft, they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone becomes more computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the expense delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso was carrying him on the Azurov Coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one lighted in the "Blood Diamond" of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in "Kmotrov" Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the muscle muscle muscle muscle community uniform.
And if we want to get into the count of his life roles, we can flood up to the image of a typical muscle with a high muscle that raises the acts in the carriage circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical cotton man's underwear, suitable and without gloves.
The English speakers call him 'tank', but Le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels is rising over all the others.
First of all, for his cruel name - even though the people are called "Marcel" - which is related to sport, because, as the legend says, the name was named by the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' comes over the other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinguished shield and (almost unsignificant) a belgic flag, which the models of the most emblishing tiles have as a detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company does not specialize only to tank tops.
He also produces mickey college, retro boxers, cashmir sweater sweaters, cotton pants, marine shirts, children's clothes, mini shorts...
Thinked pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame to be just a underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
A huge image with her sister did not stop her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, even though small figures, is a woman full of life.
The new acts in the fashion are taking Cruz's sisters very seriously now.
For Monica, it means much more than just that some nice, famous girls borrow their name.
In Paris, the promotion was attended by the Mango company in its new seat, and the announcement of the most important fashion prices that this Spanish company is sponsoring.
She's heartless and daring, and she'll get you closely.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection that we proposed to Sister Penelope for Mango for this year's autumn-winter season, and I also attended the release of the second year of "Mango Fashion Awards" and the dinner in Opera for Valentine's Honour.
So it was difficult, but at the same time an exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango before you work for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the '50s and '60s, and we pulled a lot of incentives.
I also like to walk around the city and watch women walk dressed, combine and layers of their clothes, and I do it very often.
You're a dancer, a actress, a designer, so a very universal woman, right?
I think so, but the end is all connected and has a lot of connections.
Maybe I liked the clothes from a little while, and I still wanted to go to Grandma's house, talk about my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going on a trip.
When I became a dance girl, I always tried to take care of how I was walking dressed.
You know, we dancers are based on how we're adjusted to feel good at our classes and tests in view of the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, you really get into the figure.
So everything is connected, but with great respect to designers and professionals.
You're 30 years old, you're in a crisis?
No, no, no, no, no.
I feel better than ever before, I'm having 30 fun.
I find out that a woman's already done, she has experience and lives enjoy less mistakes.
The biological hours don't scare me.
I'm doing what I want from a little while, and it gives me great internal happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother because my body wants it, and I want to be a young mom, and I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about it.
But one thing I know is, I'm going to make my child feel happy and I'm going to raise him with great love.
As for the movie, you're waiting for a few premiers of movies you filmed last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to coming to the movies.
I'm from the theater world, so I'm very impatient and unhealthy, and I want everything right now, and that's not what I can do.
I look forward to the Prime Minister of La Ultima Mountain and "En Busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like them...
A few days ago, you had your prime minister on a show moll by Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to get on the mole like a model.
Just called me Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend the beneficial shows for her organization "Women for Better Life", and the clothes we've made -- I've also chosen two models from our collection for Mango -- and the excursion was transferred to this Naomin non-governmental organization.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things are talking about her, and since I know her, I can tell you that many of them aren't true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good thing he's engaged in.
She asked me to play for charity, but if she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it too.
For the benefit of women of the third world, I will do what it takes.
Drivers will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior requires that the driver with three administrative sanctions for the management under the influence of alcohol in his car install a system that will prevent him from launching a drunk car or if he does not breathe.
The proposal has already been acquainted in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the High State Representativeship, according to which it is a pilot project that takes one year.
His goal is to return the driver to the wheel, so the drivers will also have to graduate the course of transport reimbursement.
In addition to this experience, the National Transport Safety Authority (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technological Institute for Car Safety (FITSA) will also participate.
According to the statistics between 30 and 75 % of carists accused more than once for drunken management again in this state.
Alcolock should prevent this, because it is a system attached to a vehicle that measures alcohol levels in an exhausted air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if it is recorded higher than the alcohol concentration allowed.
His price exceeds 1,000 euros and it would have to be replaced by the guilty himself.
The study carried out in this sense in the United States in 2007 showed that for vehicles equipped with this equipment, in the first year of the introduction, offences were reduced by 65 %.
In Spain, 115 people could be saved every year.
The measures shall be limited to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: in order to address this behavior before it becomes criminal.
In order to facilitate its introduction, as the legal adjustment can be implemented normally, the necessary amendment of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in no sales version, even though some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been tested.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on the PSOE proposal (Spain Workshop Socialist Party), in which it is recommended to install this system in school buses, as in France.
In Mexico and no "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 17:40, as it was in the program, the presidential hangar landed at Benita Juarez airport in Mexico D. F., a plane of Spanish air forces in which Princess and Princess from Asturia landed.
The sun was just falling, but its lights still had to cover their eyes so as to see a follow-up couple coming out of the plane.
The Spanish Ambassador and other officials standed under the shelter.
A few hours ago, I asked a taximan on the street if he knew that the Spanish princess and the princess were coming to a public visit.
Yeah, well, that's great, it's not gonna get to the airport at the time... she's out of here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she's been living here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right.
The Mexican press, however, well knows who the princess and the princess of Astury are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting at the hangar at the airport close to the red carpet and the military cordon, which forms 27 sea soldiers ready to shoot a honourable salvage.
The Prince appears with a smile on the lips in a dark blue suit and a princess, very mediumly dressed and with brown hair, has no common "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D.F. a storm is threatened.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at the photographers and unforcibly call them.
At the door of the hotel, one of the four largest in the city, a mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
Best-funded fashion price
There's probably no better place in the world to announce the fashion price than Paris and probably not a better designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second year of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to allow international presentation to new fashion talents.
The price is subsidised by the amount of 300 000 euros.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year, was looking at her proposals yesterday in the Manga exhibition on the Paris Bullwar, Haussmann number 54 and almost cried with an impression.
Of course, it is the second largest business of this company in Europe and was just opened on the surface of 1,335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank Valentine's designers for taking the presidency of the jury, caused us to eventually have dinner in Paris Opera Garnier.
Mango's fiercely decorated presidential table looked next to the most famous Chagall's works.
Nati, who with a heartbreaking grief for the recent death of her brother, did not show anything, put on the dress of this tag and ELAH jewelry over whom the breath was hidden, and hanged to her son Luise - almost two-four-foot elegant - accompanied by Valentine in the table at dinner for his honour.
Andik, the boss and the owner of Mango, was welcomed, and as a gentleman, he remained with baron Rothschild without his jacket, because they both offered them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived in a shop in - own-handed - pants and shirts and for dinner, changed into a long black sexy dress, touched the night walk after Opera at the accompanying Goya Toleds, showed us a ballet test room and, remembering the other times, she caught one of the sticks and marked "grand plue".
Iness Sastre didn't keep her in the next palace, but she showed us photos of her son on her cell phone before she left.
The next morning we could love the presence of Olivier Mart√≠nez - another young man riding on the motorcycle - and John Travolta, who came to the Paris Hotel Intercontinental with his own clothing and towels and asked for no smell in his rooms.
Stars under the star Paris sky.
Oh l√†l√†, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1,000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about chaotic and cruel daily life.
And that's not enough, they're all summarized in one book that will bring relaxation to the book on September 30th.
The alarm bells every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but even worse, it is to imagine itself absorbed in a rapid rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called voltage and computer pain in the back.
Stress is a sickness of the 21st century.
However, there are no ways to combat daily exhaustion and difficulties to get away from the world of work.
No, that number is nothing bigger and nothing smaller than 1001.
Susannah Marriott outside the yogin position, classic massage and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book collected all "menu" options adjusted according to the taste and time options of each individual.
The anti-tribute book is called "1001 Relaxation Method" and by the Computer of Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone feels that there is no way to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relations, ‚Äúthe manual‚Äù denies this view.
Furthermore, it offers further procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If your veins do not have adrenaline that reinstates the balance in your body and stress becomes a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Speaking of sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I mean, not those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they're sleeping.
When it happens for the first time, it may make you scared, but it's actually irrelevant.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquie.
It's very common, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely not one of you were told that he was talking from sleep last night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (e.g. once in life in high fevers), or with more regularity (each day, once a week, once a few months...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There's not only one reason that would explain her occurrence.
Frequently it is associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nightmares, enuresia nocturna (night support) or moonlion, but it must not be.
As mentioned earlier, many of them may be accompanied by very high fever, stress or explosive situations.
In any case, it is a little bit of a tested phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a quiet voice, speak individual words, whisper, or just on the contrary (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the child is exposed with great strength, it would be appropriate to observe and consult an expert to find out if he has no problem that causes great concern and thus expresses his concern.
We said it was a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is joined in another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example if it is associated with apnea or with permanent stress).
However, we can do so that we will have a few very simple preventive measures in mind, such as:
Try not to disturb the child too much before he goes to sleep.
So to look for peaceful games and avoid scary or some violent TV programs or series.
In very nervous children and those who can relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the baby to sleep more calmly.
When somniloquia appears, try to be calm.
Remember that she is harmless for the child and that the other day she will not remember anything.
Consumptional advice
Don't wake him.
It's unnecessary because he's not aware and you're gonna stop his sleep.
Even though he speaks, he sleeps, and he rests.
Remember, if you feel that you have a lot of trouble, it would be appropriate to turn to advice or to find out what causes such anxiety in your child.
If you understand what he says (what is not so common), avoid the temptation to question him and draw information from it.
It's not going to be good, because when he's sleeping, he's not aware that he can arrange thoughts.
Besides, you will hear what he says, but you don't know what he dreams about, and then why he says it, so be careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you're making.
Never tell the child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not a joke.
That causes great concern.
Don't just worry, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeuseurrn finally after a long thin period again found the way to win.
Without playing a great game, the yellows have created more chances and have been able to convert one of them victoriously.
During this conflict, the game did not have a very rapid pace in which the attackers had only hardly prosecuted.
After the first attempt of the captain's guests, Kauffmann, who fired away only by hair passed the connection, he began to have Illhaeusern lightly above and first Fonderflick from the distance, then Hirne with air, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate Dannemaria's defense.
The rival built a defense wave in the half of the field and left only agil Riahi on the assault.
The beginning of the second half turned out to be a decisive, first thanks to the two Dannemaria bars with the names of Riahi and Temporal, then after the opening of the score for Illhaeusern, which Marais took care of, well set for the processing of the ball reflected after the previous Diebold experiment (53').
However, Golman Illhaeusern had not enjoyed much joy for a while, about 12 minutes later, he was forced to return to his dressing room and to leave his fellow players in a weakness.
But Dannemaria couldn't get out of it and the 11th of Illhaeusern, who just took a little away to "cuff" defense, no longer caused any bigger trouble, except for the entire last seconds of the match, when the ball after a big confusion flyed very close to the march.
Sarkozy goes along with angered fishermen
Before leaving to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride through Bretania.
In order to face the demonstration of the strength of the fishermen who severely violated the availability of several Breton and Normand ports on Monday, the French president decided to go to the Guilvinic port of Finist√®re to meet their representatives there on Tuesday morning.
The last named promised that it would be adopted "in a constructive spirit" and hoped "will come with specific proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the "crisis committee" meeting created by the Breton fishermen in order to obtain measures against a rapid increase in oil prices that have reached a top of a average of 1.14 euro per litre.
According to the speaker of the Elyse Palace, David Martinon will "display with them the solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and better ensure the conditions of employment and sailors' payments".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected for fishers with inadmissibility.
On Tuesday morning, the operation was performed by the "Helmage" (accessions slowly driven vehicles) in Morbihan and Calvados departments, causing a closer 10 km trap.
The recreation port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-quota were not interrupted.
A filtering barrel was carried out on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The Mariners have proved their determination on Monday, when at the dawn before the storage of the flying ports in Brest and Lorinth burned tyres and palettes, while demonstrations were in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports on the coast of Atlantic and Manche channel, like Sables d'Olonne in Vendee, where the traulers remained in the port, or to Le Havru, where about 20 ships blocked the operation of commercial ships.
Fisheries from Turball and Croisicu in Loire-Atlantique area during the evening stopped the blockage of the important Raffinery Total in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they eventually decide to act at the middle meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinic, the "crisis committee" should decide on how to continue on the road, and on its participation in the prepared meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris on Tuesday.
However, some Breton fishers do not want to be represented by the leaders of the State fishing committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go from nothing" and "they don't want to get to Paris," said, for example, Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Union of Fisheries in Lorinth.
Fishers from the polling that do not pay oil tax are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the yard of the ship's profitability is achieved only when oil is below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman Great
Unforgettable representative "Butche Cassidy and Kid" died as a result of cancer at 83 years of age in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes also worshiped the legend of the movie and politically engaged actres Paul Newman, who died at 83 years of age.
Embraer maintains its supplies for 2008
Brazilian aircraft producer relies on a 215 aircraft supplies this year, over the threat of a global economy.
The Fourth Air Constructor in the World, Embraer, maintains its supplies for 2008 with 215 supplied devices, confirmed by his President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian constructor promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially on the scope of its planes from 30 to 120 seats.
Until today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese clients within eight years.
The AIG is saying that it considers the transposition of 15 % of its assets
The American International Group Insurance, which the American Monetary Authority has received over water, considers that more than 15% of its assets would be made to pay $85 billion given to him as a backup, writes the Sunday Financial Times issue.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of the majority of its activities outside the life insurance in the international field and retirement activities in the United States, specifying a journal quoting the sources of close to the negotiation.
According to FT, the AIG Administrative Board met on Sunday during the evening to examine the eventual proceedings.
AIG was not possible to obtain any confirmative declaration from the AIG.
The assets that AIG is going to remove include its air leasing branch of International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance provider of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and investment in private equity, is supplied by the FT.
No final decision on these proceedings has yet been taken, continues the FT.
AIG must accelerate cash in order to pay the loan 85 billion, provided by the Federal Reserve Bank, risking the US authorities to enter 80 % of the capital, which will at the same time settle the corresponding ratio of the current shareholders.
Paris. Analysis of the historic meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Bureau recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan for saving the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, which is an unseen loss coming from 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777,68 at 10,365,45 points.
The biggest point failure in his history (about 684.81) recorded on September 17, 2001, on the day of the renewal of the trading after terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The index of Nasdaq with the prevailing technology component lost, according to definitive data after the completion of the trade, 199,61 point and steadyed to 1 983,73 and the expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) at 1 106.55 points.
Unfortunately since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street literally failed after the unexpected rejection of the plan for rescuing the Banks of the House of Representatives, a plan that was to enable the market to re-see a little stability.
228 votes against and 205 for representatives refused to provide the Secretary of State Treasury to Henry Paulson the means he asked for.
Two Republicans of three rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal sent to the market that sees that Congress is unable to adopt a plan," Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial believes.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added and expressed concerns that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late".
"If this project is really condemned to disappear..., the cafete will be immediately transferred to the Fed (U.S. Central Bank, Red.) and to other central banks to explode the crisis, which would strengthen the credit conditions," Brian Bethune, head of the Global Insight Economy.
And with the emphasis on the urgent situation, Piegza reported that in the United States, "every new day brings a fall of one financial institution".
After the Friday crash, Washington Mutual organized the bank's banking offices with its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly took place and demanded immediate intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which suggests that the markets are not dealing "only with the American crisis, but with the world crisis", added analyst from FTN Financial.
The bond market has grown strongly.
The remuneration of the cash inventory for 10 years dropped to 3,632% compared to 3,827 % on Friday night, the amount of 30 years to 4,161 % compared to 4.357% of the previous day.
Obama won on points in the first TV duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House followed the second debate, whose task was to find out who from the couples John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The commanding states of the Republicans and Democrats campaign did not surprise both of them when they announced their victory in the TV duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, whatever decent, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before presidential elections, decline in research.
The Gallup's Institute, whose public opinion survey issued on Saturday, gives Obama five points (49% vs. 44% for McCain), believes that the democrat is the winner in duel.
Among the undecided voters that are currently concerned, Obama is a winner for 39% questioned, while, according to the CBS survey, 25% condemns McCain's victory.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday by means of the alleged good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and simultaneously the only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's talented," Bill Clinton noted, however, on the weekend.
The Seventieth McCain systematically raised his unsupportable experience in foreign policy fields, while emphasizing the "naivity" of his rival in questions that formed the core of the first conflict.
"Sounds like Senator Obama didn't understand that..." there was a repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he also assured.
In such a attack spirit, they were carried out since yesterday's Republican television spot.
On the contrary, Obama emphasized the future.
He didn't lose his head and turned out to be short and precise.
He raised his ability to make the right decisions and renew the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama yes," he replied on the weekend of a democratic spot, which the republican says that he does not take sufficiently into consideration the impact of the crisis on the "free American".
"When the ninety-minute debate of that John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday before 20,000 people gathered at the North Carolina election meeting as a rain.
He didn't even say words like "medium class" or "working." The financial discontinuation clearly benefits from Obama, which the Americans consider more eligible to save the economy on the edge of the ruin.
"The next week could be a crucial turnout," estimated yesterday an influenced Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama with the one Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For a candidate of democrats, the current disaster is "the final verdict of the eight-year bad economic policy, as George Bush operated and supported by Senator McCain".
Senator from Illinois reaffirmed that, through unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should be able to reduce taxes from 95% of the Americans, and also warned that the realization of the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy resources is its priority number one, together with the introduction of the health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided questions regarding the financial assistance plan of $700 billion (470 billion euros), which was adopted by the Congress last night and which is very unpopular.
"What are you, have you noticed that some choices were made in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday night at the main square of Belarusian capital to in advance reject the results of parliamentary elections.
Several hundred Belarus gathered on Sunday night immediately after the closing of the election rooms at the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregularity of elections to Parliament.
Although no results have yet been announced, many young people have come to demonstrate the regime of President Luka≈°enk: "Dictator, Demision".
Some admit that they didn't even go to the elections, "What would it be if they were doing what they wanted to do with my voice anyway," said one young man.
It does not believe that this regime, which has acted favourably to foreign observers in order to renew negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to turn towards democracy.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 whiterusian sheets and the freezing of certain assets, could be cancelled if the elections are considered clean.
It wasn't the opposition.
"We were kept away from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the summary of votes," complained Juri Potemkin, speaker of the Democratic Forces Union, a diversity of the twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," stressed Alexandr Milinkievic, a former opposition candidate in the presidential elections in 2006, and the leadership of the pro-European movement, "because it is essential who counts the votes, and it is an executive power for us.
If any opposition Members get into Parliament, it will be appointed, not elected.
However, their entry into parliament may mean television, meetings in regions and proposals of law."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in political functioning, as "needs to begin dialogue with the European Union.
Since our economy, deeply owed by Russia, will face a crisis and we will not reform ourselves, it threatens us to become a Protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the elections, shall not make the elections valid.
It stresses that the participation seems too high and that the general introduction of early vote (26% of the voters in Minsk) has opened the path to all possible manipulations.
"What did you, have you noticed that there were any choices?" he asked the social-democratic leader Alexandr Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no foot in the electoral rooms.
And there will be at least five opposition Members in parliament, those who are the most suitable to the regime."
The night silence has been remained in the October Square.
On TV, President Luka≈°enko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate their success.
Interview - Blood that is sure again
Hema-Qu√©bec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the establishment yesterday and his president, Dr. Francine D√©cary, was rightly rejoiced because Hema-Qu√©bec became one of the most reliable and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained the trust of the public that was seriously compromised after the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the state blood reserve managed by the Committee for the Transfusion of the Canadian Red Cross was contaminated by a virus of immune deficit (HIV) and a virus of hepatitis C during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the wave of the public, the Canadian government has launched a public investigation in February 1994, which was chaired by Judge Horace Krever and which was intended to explain the circumstances that led to such tragedy, and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not be repeated.
While Judge Crever deployed the report, some provinces have set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Qu√©bek, G√©linea‚Äôs committee took this role.
After G√©lineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Qu√©bec, which was to maintain Qu√©bec, and the Canadian blood company for supply of all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Qu√©bec started his activities in 1998, barely 38% of people had confidence in the qu√©bec blood system," Dr. D√©cary recalls.
"The situation was creepy.
In continental efforts to increase the safety of blood products and permanent work in this area, we have regained confidence in the public during the next years," he says and proudly adds that Hema-Quebeka had trusted nearly 94% of the qu√©bec population in early 2008.
Dr. Decary, however, does not lose from the sight that "confidence is something very fragile."
Hema-Qu√©bec has already applied the principle of caution since his establishment on 28 September 1998.
"We were then witnessing in Europe many cases of human disease of crazy cows, new varieties of disease called Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease," a woman who has led the company since its establishment in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could be spreading in blood.
We were therefore based on one of the basic recommendations of Krever and G√©lineau's report, which, according to when we do not know and when there is a serious disease in the face of Creutzfeldt-Jacob's disease, which marks the degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, it is necessary to take exclusive measures.
In April 1999, we therefore rejected blood from people who have been staying in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease was transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that it had meaning to stick to the principle of caution."
In 1999, a much more precise technique was shown on the market to identify HIV virus: tests using Nuclear Acid (NAT), which allow you to reveal directly the presence of the virus itself, not the presence of antibodies on which the tests used earlier.
The NAT tests have made it possible to reduce the deaf period that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when our blood techniques can be discovered by the first viruses, explains a specialist.
We were able to reduce this period for less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing that and without finding out.
This improvement has made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of AIDS through blood transfusion.
The risk that he gets the blood contaminated HIV is exposed to one of 12 million people today.
"In other words, it means that before someone infects HIV, 12 million blood products will need to be distributed.
Hema-Qu√©bec is distributing 400 000 to 500 000 blood products annually, and it will take 24 years before the first case of transmission of HIV through the blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can get in full peace or prescribe blood transfusions necessary to heal," Hema-Quebek says.
"The call for the next decades is to preserve the safety of our products.
We never know what a illness element can occur in the system.
Last year, a chikungunya virus appeared on the island of R√©union, which is similar to the Western Nile virus transmitted into blood by insect stabbing.
It must be constantly careful," Dr. D√©cary continues and stresses that, in addition to safe supplies, Hema-Qu√©bec must also count on sufficient supplies.
"Needs grow, because the population's getting old.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or blood platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the network of blood donors, which is in the average only 3% of the Qu√©becans allowed for donation."
Each healthy person is at least 18 years old, matching the criteria of accuracy, but he can only give blood once in 56 days, which means six times a year.
14% of the people offering blood is not accepted in an average because they are, for example, AIDS or malaria, and if they visited the country where the colds are organised, they are excluded for one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
Members of the donator network, however, should be complemented in moderate ways of ageing and cannot give blood anymore.
However, persuading people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unlinked today that we can only find a hour so we can offer blood," Francene Decary is distressed.
With the annual budget of 297 million dollars Hema-Qu√©bec delivers not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart cloves, eye bulves and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Qu√©bek, which also manages the only public bank of blood from the puppy string in Qu√©bek.
The powder, which was previously considered biomedical waste, swallows blood rich on tribal cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated our thousands of blood samples from the puppy rope to the bank, and we assume that we will take them over a thousand a year.
At the beginning of the next year, we should start offering them for transplantation," states Dr. Decary, which program of blood collection from the puppy rope describes as a very favorite.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they have no access to it," because Hema-Qu√©bec does not have enough resources to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Qu√©bek.
Football - Impact in semifinal
Impact Montr√©al qualified yesterday at the Saputo Stadium during the second and at the same time the four-final game played at the total number of gates qualified in the semi-final series of the first division of the USL, thanks to victory 3:1 (4:3 is a goal balance after both matches) over Sounders from Seattl.
Antonio Ribeiro booker gave the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the two sideless first half, the booker David Testo and Rocco Plancentino left two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan for Sounders.
Recall that on Friday during the first of the two quartfinal matches Impact in Starfire Complex in Tuquile in the suburb of Seattl defeat 2:1.
The impression will measure its power in the semifinal with Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder balanced in the home game deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, however, Whitecaps went into a semi-final round with a total number of gates 5:4.
The impact should be encountered on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series of matches will be confirmed until today.
Shortly - Kovalev's victory goal
The first attack three Canadien is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alexe Kowalev, Tomas Plekens and Andreje Costicina last night in Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win Canadien 3:2 on separate invasions.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the confrontation, shot the goal, Plekanec gathered two assistants and Kovalev made one input in this fourth victory of three-colored of six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by giving the only goal during separate attacks.
"I'm not ready yet," said the Russian.
"I need another match to make me feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to handle it too much," Guy Carbonneau noted.
"I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a nice applause."
Charity bets north
The Prime Minister does not exclude that by the end of the year, it will invoke early elections
Right after the Liberal Parti liberal convention, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Qu√©bek, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's supplementary elections.
"Drop the limits of our last large northern border," is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday visually in a visual way in the conclusion of the Liberal Party of Qu√©bek in L√©vis, without telling details.
During his speech, paintings were drawn behind his back in a picture mill.
Three giant plates were run by a slip with amazing photos of hydroelectric barracks, down, Qu√©bek from the Google Maps view, maps, etc.
Capacity funds, just as in the pre-election period.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to dismiss that on the autumn he would call early elections, even though he noted that he had a very loaded program.
The North Plan forms the fourth dimension of "vision", which the Prime Minister intends for Qu√©bec, a vision of "new economic space", which includes a working force agreement with France, a convention between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontaria.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North-North Territory at the 49th equilibrium - the prime minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been a subject of presentation.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "beauty with a huge potential", but did not specify the term, investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
He mentioned several approaches to points that could further be divorced: especially water power plants, forests, but mainly the mine sector, encouraged by growth of developing countries and renewing public infrastructures.
North, according to Charest's calculation, contains "nickl, zin, copper, platina, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "a terrain twice the size of France is in our place," "is in Qu√©bek.
And it's not just with us, but it's in us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he was calling for a national founder's myth.
Qu√©bec was built largely in relation to the North, raised the prime minister: hunting for gold in Abibi, qu√©bec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after he shut up the theater to see a huge map behind his back.
North, 70% of the Qu√©bec territory, includes the part of Labrador, which Qu√©bec has always demanded, specificated the premier during the press conference.
"It's one of the traditional attitudes that have repeated all the governments.
There is one border line for which the Convention is no longer available, and if an appropriate opportunity, in the name of the government, I will reconsider this position," he said.
Otherwise, "It is also necessary to reconsider our vision of the North," he said when he spoke of the north-west transition, which will open for a year as a result of ice sink.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking the territory becomes an obligation.
What about the inhabitants of the territories, the original nations and the Inuites?
The Prime Minister said the qu√©bec government would be very careful with them and that their project would be useful, especially young.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Letourneau (ex-pequist Member of Ungava), have already launched negotiations with about 30 communities.
The inter-ministerial committee chaired by Beno√Øt Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important position.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily summit," but the moment "the common vision will be drawn."
The development of the North should remain in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be "communically designed, structured and genuine to the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a vision of the Liberal Prime Ministers that were preceding it.
"We have changed our minds as the Liberals before us, to change our challenges in new opportunities for growth and development."
This was, eventually, one of the still shaken themes of the weekend, which was started on Friday with a large cocktail elevating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage to the front of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted suggests to cross Beauharnois' centre at the Adelyard-Godbout barrier.
"After Godbut, who founded Hydro-Qu√©bec, through Lesage, which carried out the Clidno Revolution and the nationalization of water power until after Bouras, who created James Bay, our party was able to create the future," Jean Charest said.
On the press conference he responded to another authority, this time conservative, even though the "Roads to the North" John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When the line arrived at the Eastmain1a-Ruper Hydroelectric, he emphasized Charest that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I say it only between us, but I plan to be in it," he conferred his Membership's base, causing considerable applause.
The same Prime Minister, who said in April, that in 2008 elections would not be, and no doubt even in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of calling elections on the autumn of this year, which allows him to receive the law.
However, he emphasized that his program was loaded, especially the mission of the Federal Council in China and the Summit of Qu√©bec-New York.
The weekend convention provided the liberal boss platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain "specific" efforts to change the constitution, which have passed very smoothly: PLQ (Liberal Qu√©bek Party) requires special recognition of "Quebec specificity" in the Constitution.
It also wishes that Qu√©bec appoint a part of the members of the Canadian Council for Radio and Television, who would have the right to veta in case of decisions adopted in Qu√©bek.
By the opposition, the North Plan was adopted skeptically in its main characteristics.
The Chief of PQ (Parti Qu√©becois) Pauline Marois re-extracted the North Qu√©bec Development Policy, launched by the Government of Landry in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal Government reached power in 2003, the politics had refused to fill this policy.
If she sticked to her, "We'd be on today," Marois noted her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections take place today) Fran√ßoise Mercure.
ADQ said she would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we wish it wasn't just a theater," explained Sebastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumont, who is coming back from holidays today.
Letters - Disappointed Countries
It was Vic Toews, exhibitor of justice (o irony) at Harper's office last summer, who allowed himself to say Louise Arbour to represent a "shame" for Canada.
In such a way to absorb a woman who has led an uncomfortable struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration, this is a lot about the premier's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of all participating Western countries, has not brought back to the country of its state member closed in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take the insight that at the time the acts to be dedicated to him was Omar Khadr a young adolescent.
The only government that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention denys its word and leaves her to rot in the non-human conditions of a child soldier.
The only one relying on the parody of justice to judge the guilt of the defendant.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty international and in particular the Association of Canadian Advocates defend the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that it can wait for a fair process in Canada.
The same government closes her eyes before torture: she doesn't care about this young man being psychologically destroyed, and it certainly lasted, after so many years of harassment.
We don't realize that, but we are just witnessing the erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy" words that Harper is so exhausting and which sounds so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more moral: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him wrong, to imprison him by the boss' liability (as after 14 October...)
Many voters believe that they will find a salvation in the country that reports the Honor, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has denied what created the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Toews, in this renouncement, not elsewhere.
Views - Orwellovski Discussion Company Barrick Gold
In the issue of 17 September, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, the executive vice president of the Canadian mine company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell's logic, it confirms that the biggest producer of gold in the world has launched the persecution of three authors and the poor little insulting company in order to invoke "transparent public debate" and demands six million.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of an injury to honor, but the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver's fundamental resolution is completely misunderstood.
Or is it for Barrick Gold the best way to lead a public debate, to bring down anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the process goes down, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectful amounts to be prepared to defend and fight in a very unbalanced fight against the army of lawyers supported by nearly withoutdenous pockets of the mine.
The tactics in these unsustained struggles are frequently in the destruction of the prosecutors in order to prosecute a commercial proceeding that will scare the mouth of the counterparty and also the fear of anyone who is daring to devote this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he had his view of the whole matter to present public opinion.
In contrast with what happens in several countries where Barrick Gold is acting, the debate in Canada is under normal circumstances in exchange of thoughts, not in the wounds.
So the mining companies did not have enough to open their books, their documentation and to set a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light into the whole matter.
However, Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and rejects petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada.
Maybe Garver could explain how he could demand "public debate" and condemn the opinions of the same public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President world only marks fatly paid lawyers, not all the Canadians; it is a pretty narrow concept of this concept.
In democracy, they also have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so mostly because he rejects the brutal ways of the mine society.
The public is ready to hear and judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in the framework of what many consider as a prosecution where the lawsuit should be stuck (in its pursuit of "public debate" by the way, Barrick has just issued an official call to the authors of Noir Canada to inform them officially that they should stop using this term...).
If we forget the Surreal Garver's speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on universal freedom of research and searching for truth that is essential for every democratic society.
It generally denies the right to quote trustworthy resources and the debate on facts and interpretations that constitute the basis of intellectual activities itself.
If in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss the subjects that do not like rich companies of this world without exposing to a repeated persecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparency debate, it could be created if it was followed by scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has been able to run debates and disagreements for a long time and to address conflicts.
The excessive complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, despite what he claims, there is no smallest desire to lead a transparent debate.
For the university world, it is a loss, as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that would limit such an unauthorized persecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
Bush's administration and delegations to the Congress, both the Republicans and the Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic salvation plan since the great crisis since the thirty-years.
The new version of the plan, by means of $700 billion, to reduce the financial crisis that has been cloured by Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it assumes: better control of the elected representatives over its applications, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of saved money, new measures to capture the quantity of houses captured for non-payment, and also the right to monitor the amount of remuneration paid by the managers of the remuneration of the companies saved.
The US Minister of Finance, Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the representative of the Republicans at the desk, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the two-day negotiation maraton.
"We have made great progress and have come to an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said the representative of Bush's administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and the common Americans are safe from the crisis in the Wall Street," explained the democrat.
"It is a fundamental point: if we don't do this, trauma, chaos and the daily life of the Americans will be enormous," the Republican Judd Gregg said.
During the last hours of the negotiation, the maximum turnovers of the effects that should be further failure to investors.
The time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US President were later called for negotiations and both expressed rather for an agreement without mentioning their dissatisfaction with the need to avoid such a extreme solution.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added the completion of the agreement on certain measures, in particular the aim of allowing the owners to reside in the residence, and the remuneration of the employees of the companies saved.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures for the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the waves of television.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station to vote for the proposed plan, said, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The gross qualities I have read [indicating] that it is something we will all have to spend and that will be able to move on.
Choosing inactivity is simply unacceptable," he said.
The aim of the 700 billion plan is to redeem a doubtful claim and risk and unprofit assets of US financial institutions for money.
The plan comes after 14 months of the crisis encountered by the cracking bubble on the real estate market, which first led to a decline in risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to the next, wider forms of loans (PCAA) and arrived in freezing cash and in banks and financial institutions.
The first proposal of the agreement last week has been made by the Republican Members.
Since the Democrats joined that for some "toxic" assets of companies with difficulties, the government will only guarantee them, but not buy them, it is convinced that the unliquidated situation is exhausted.
In an effort to close the contrary views in the Congress, measures were attached to the Government's power to introduce new fees that would help her get her contribution back if the programme resulted in taking losses for five years.
The new plan counts on the contribution of the first amount of 250 billion to which another 100 billion will be added if the president considers it necessary.
The additional 350 billion contribution should be approved by the Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will receive shares in saved companies which will pay dividends in the case of profit and which he will be able to sell again when it is over.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the procedures for disposal of real estate related to loans relating to the plan, as well as to lay down the limits for the assessment and compensation paid by the managers of the companies affected.
The engineers of the plan would like to subscribe to the vote in the House of Representatives already today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the effort made, they are not sure if their plan is green.
Because yesterday, the votes were raised against this project both in the Republican and in the democratic camp.
"It is absolutely obvious that Washington can't hear you," the Republican Scott Garrett, member of the Financial Commission of the House, declared at the address of the voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there's a solution.
However, making money on taxes is not a solution."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, congressman group moderator called "Sceptics Committee", presents the whole thing differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred respected economies professors, among them three Nobel Price holders, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and carefully examine which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe has reaffirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
After an extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries reported partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion USD).
The intervention of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg governments has become necessary after the French Bank of BNP Paribas announced that it departs from the purchase of its competitors, which is at the border of the decline since the loss of 2 billion euros (2.9 billion USD) as a result of a risk loan crisis in the purchase of real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"We will not lose this money," the Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos announced yesterday.
"In return, we receive election law in the bank and influence.
And that's what the stewards and households can appreciate today in uncertainty."
On the other hand of the La Manche channel, it seems the British government has launched another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion USD) made loans to buy real estate.
According to his announcement yesterday, the Spanish Bank of Santander will buy branches and accounts of the British bank's clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after the Northern Rock, which the British government has to have nationalized since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with shark eyes long represented his triumph, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor get out with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and the uncomfortable talent that he had had also distantly distantly from the force category that produces real stars.
But what a runner on a long trail!
Paul Newman died on Friday at 83 years at his ranch in Connecticut as a result of the lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of fat years of American movies.
Less brilliant than Brando, who was similar and long as his rival on the film platoon, Newman was a more careful actor, surely crushing, but also by the apostles of freedom and disturbance of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, his father was the German Jew and the mother of Hungary.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dreams was born.
No excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it appeared in this whole country in love with the self made man, a warrior in the Pacific, injured in battle, who studied actorship in Yale in the early 50s, then visited New York Actor's Studio and celebrated a triumph in the theatre, in television and starts in the movie.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car raceman who was located as the second in the 24-hour race in Le Mans in 1979, and also a sexual symbol, even though since 1958 he was a model couple with the actress Joanne Woodward.
It also leaves sharp places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged stars, allergic to the calling of his own show-business, which will always remain to a certain degree of mystery.
A decent man, in the most gracious words of sense.
The departure of Paul Newman this weekend caused a turning up to the lovers of the movie, while his great role is competitive at the black plate of memories.
It defills more than a half-century perpetuating American seventh art.
A young man who refuses his sensitive wife (Elizabeth Taylor) at the burned roof, adaptation of Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From less ancient past (1990) we remember his sensitive Mr Bridge, disturbed at the advanced age of marriage, which did not fulfill all the expectations.
So many other Pauls of Newmans went into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, rushed, violent, unforgettable delikvent from Somebody Up Theres Likes Me, Robert Wise, a role designed for James Dean, taken after his death, which Newman introduced in 1956.
Sympathetic gangster in the perfect great The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
A bitter and revenge ball player in the amazing The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same figure in The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, which will bring him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face traveling for ages, that was him.
And he's still.
In his professional track, the rivals of different eras are competitive.
The young people know him primarily because of the Cultural Slap Shot George Roye Hilla (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlope, a non-traditional hockey coach.
The fans met him again in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy brothers Coen.
He then closed his career by the boss of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends that had soon left the work, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with his golds, discretion and derogations.
The French filmer Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered him "living challenge of underwear," assuming he pushed too much on the pile in his performance.
For the lovely Paul Newman, who came to the role as a merchandise, profession was not always so gentle.
The first lovers, however, played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps, and despairs, whose rebellions and rebellions reflected in his perfect characteristics.
As director Newman revealed a little famous pages of his shameful sensitivity.
His film, Rachel, 1968 (by the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife Joanne Woodward played the main role of his wife, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholia.
His son Scott, who was lost overdose, was dedicated to Harry and Son in 1984, a work full of shame and grief.
In the invasion of the honours that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former combat Robert Redford (the Sting and the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) mournedly said, "His presence made my life better and this country."
generosity, love for life, such are the main characteristics of the dead actor.
If we skip his legendary career, he also leaves a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opponent of Hollywood's destruction.
We were used to see the vineyard bottles, sauce, cookies and other foods, which could seem pretty intact, although the beginning was a gag.
However, the profits from sale went to his Foundation for difficult childhood.
Newman did, rather than let himself slip in glory, engaged in society by the last moment.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these sentences: "Well and until the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was honoured to be here."
And for us, it was an honour to watch the path of life so bright and generous American artist.
Besides, the end of the end, a model citizen.
What was made in the factory on the factures Zushlag & spol.?
Soon, 8 October, the trial in the criminal proceedings led against Janos Zuschlag and his companions will begin.
Politicians and his associates are, in addition to other criminal acts, including fake papers, accused of a long-term fraud and systematically criminal organisation, which resulted in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutor, they used the money gained in public competitions for their own purposes and often understood the performance of the tasks by fictional invoices.
Money from the state and self-government - by a range of approximately 65 million forints - traveled partly to the treasure of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly into the pockets of individuals.
The way that the investigating authority also informed was that the money obtained in public competitions was collected on the basis of the facts under which there was no real countervaluation and the commitments taken by the mergers never received.
According to the prosecution, a lot of invoices were fake.
The printing of these invoices came from the Josefvaros market, the round slip was made in Kiscunhalas.
On the names on which companies are to produce invoices, they decided, inter alia, on the district road across the northern coast of Balaton, on which Istwan Lados Janos Zuszlag sent.
According to his confession, you were first appointed to see pensions and restaurants.
In these cases, he asked for accounts for its consumption, according to which the invoices subsequently were produced under public competitions issued by the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respects by the Principal Administration.
In most cases, Istwan Lados and his companion Andras √Ørim, who, according to our information, most frequently wrote reports needed to obtain subsidies.
Lados saw a bedroom on his "study road".
According to the two factors issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this guest food equipment was provided for the ninety-year group of the biztos Pont.
But, according to the claim of the manager of the company, so many people would not at once enter this facility.
She was also incorporated by formal and content errors in the summer 2002 foundation called Jobb J√∂v√§ert, later Egy√ºtt and Harmadik Evezredert.
The Pension in Badacsonomai had only three rooms, and more than ten people couldn‚Äôt sleep in it one night, but the invoice was set at 130 guests.
Nonetheless, the complementors of the press with a rich fantasy have exaggerated it even when they introduced a company devoted to the documentation of the same hostility - Pigal s. r. o., in which accounting according to the information provided to the State representation, documents called Jobb J√∂vwert and Hoppa were not even figured.
The leader of the Gy.z. Farkas for hvg.hu stated that when he was called to the prosecutor and showed his invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were in the wrong place."
As he added, except for formalities, it did not agree that, according to the invoice, there were only 11 rooms that were not so capable.
Furthermore, the invoice also indicated food, and their restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The zealous invoice producers did not even make sure that the viewed Budapest travel office organizes only foreign roads, and on the cash-payment invoice, which was also inconsistent with the invoice practice of the company, they foolishly introduced as a travel mediation service to Hungary.
Furthermore, as a result of the investigation, they also introduced VAT in the document, even though the organisation of roadways to countries outside the European Union has been released from the VAT.
On the four documents presented by the Jobb J√∂v√ºert, Hotel R√©vf√ºl√∂p s. r. o. did not agree, inter alia, on the amount of VAT. However, the company does not apply to the activity of 25 per cent, but 15 per cent of the VAT, except the hotel employees were only printed invoices, but the invoice made was written by the hand.
Furthermore, the "suppliers" of the invoice may have corrupted by pointing out how the investigation of the state representation was shown in one company as an operational road transport of goods that the company originally was not carrying out on the investment consultation.
The factures issued by Egy√ºtt and Harmadik √âvezedert and the mergers of XXI. Shazadi Culturelis Egyes√ºlet and Biztos Pont are fake, except for formal deviations - the unsuitable form of invoice and the incorrect trail.
As in the case of Ravenna k.s. or the Sport camp in Kunfeherto, whose representatives denied that they would expose the invoices.
For example, fakes did not even notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyieregyhaza was in the time (2001) when the group of Fiatal Varosert was eating in the compound, in liquidation, that is why, according to our information, the liquidation Commissioner of the company also denied that the paper was issued by him.
The factures were consciously exposed
The second group of invoicers were those who knew they were going to expose a fictional invoice.
The Es√©la Budapestert Foundation issued accounts for about four million forensics for the Harmadik √âvezedert fund at the request of the organization Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Shocialist.
The leader of the Collab s. r. o. made a charge to issue a fictive account one of the accused Ludovic Gy√∂rfi.
With Zuschlag and his associates, Biogate also cooperated with. r. o., currently in the liquidation that provided the Fundation Jobb J√∂v√§ert and the Communities Atlasz and V√∂r√∂spheny with invoices of approximately five million forins that were not the actual economic activity.
Neither money movement, since the invoices created were later collapsed, which, of course, the organisation has forgotten to state in its documents.
Another group of invoice firms belongs to those who had liaisons to the defendant.
For example, Iwan Kubatov was the authorised representative of the Ukrainian Deputy Delta Tri√≥ s. r. o., dealing with engineering materials and motor vehicles, with a seat in Budapest, where the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company exhibited a number of invoices for the sale of funds of the calculation technology of approximately 18 million forints.
According to the invoice found by the investigations, the Kiscunhalas Cash Investment s. o., which has been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
The company was a man from Romania who was supposed to transmit papers on the company as well as Ivan Kubatov in 2002-2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted that he issued invoices on behalf of the company to the communities of Atlas, Hoppa and Egy√ºtt and Harmadik Evezredert and himself accepted their countervalue.
On the request of Ivan Kubatova, the Romanian wallers were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
However, none of the companies actually worked, according to the accused because they didn't get a job.
Nevertheless, the businesses were for him, because on the request of a joint defendant, Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding papers, he exposed on behalf of the companies of invoice to the Atlash and Y-Generacio connected to Zuschlago.
In the name of companies Investment, Delta Tri√≥, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov to the organisations a total of 15 invoices of 14.2 million forints.
The state representation has argued that Kubatov came to 10 per cent of the amounts set out on invoices and VATs.
To expose fictive invoices, this time for the selection procedure for the Communities Biztos Pont, a man also used Szi-Beri k.t.
In January 2006, Y-Generacio and ≈†√∂vets√©g and Modern Magyarorshagert submitted proposals for the public competition of the Mihalye Tancsics (TMA), publicly useful socialist parties organisations.
They acquired after 500 thousand forensics, but did not make the amounts for the objectives set out in the proposals.
In order to make it clear, TMA submitted five fictive invoices from the Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices have been found at the home surveillance office of Arpada Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, a part of the defendants will probably describe the process of the production of invoices, as she has already done in the prosecution.
It may be more interesting if everything decides to reveal itself the main defendant Janos Zushlag.
Because his present statement is not too detailed, and although he promised several times that he would expose everything widely, he has not done so yet.
The question is, if it is in his interest - in exchange for a large part of the damage, 50 million forints, perhaps socialists made an agreement with him and Zusi will take it on.
At the end of the time, he could have been insulted, since his requests to mitigate the conditions of his detention, namely, to be placed in domestic prison, remained undue.
While the offenders of economic crimes who have committed much more damage that have not yet been replaced, they can walk freely or at least wait for the end of their conduct in their homes, he does not have that option.
Psychology of Trumpfing: Why do we spend more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, to overestimate goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this famous - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been able to reveal researchers from the neurology and economy of the New York University.
According to their studies published in the Science magazine, people do not want to remain in the eBay auction, so they would rather pay too high price.
The research was attempted to map the scheme of this "play" in the nervous system through the experimental auction.
One volunteer group betted, the second group participated in played auctions, using a method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) examining active brain areas of experimental persons.
In both games, participants could win money, however at the auction game, whose important element was to overthrow the other side, began to work intensely under the brain corridor called striatum in losing.
This brain area plays aside from many other functions of the "self-reproduction" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to researchers, the price reduction is therefore possible to explain by trying to avoid a strong reaction of the uncle.
In order to support their theory, the members of the research team conducted a number of economies of financial cross-section investigations.
Under different conditions, three groups were convicted against one partner.
The control group was simply informed about the real value of the product, and they made bets.
Furthermore, members of the next group were promised that if they go out of the game victory, they will be rewarded for another $15.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but, of course, its members lost the money in the event of the loss.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, all in the fact that one was emphasized by winning and another loss.
However, members of the group playing "protection" were willing to go higher than in the control and "wind" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"This results cannot be concluded from no previous economic theory.
Because they have yet explained the phenomenons observed at the auctions of joys from victory and avoiding risk.
When neurological viewing methods helped us to solve the dispute between these two theories by now reaching a third explanation," Andrew Schotter, professor of the Economic Faculty of the New York University.
Hepatitis: When do you find a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is reported among the main causes of death.
The number of home cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to 100 000, but only seven thousand of them are treated.
The name of hepatitis is the summary name of infectious liver damage caused by different viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, the inflammation of liver and yellow, however, the originators of the disease and the disease caused by them differs from each other.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the originating diseases are distributed by two main ways: hepatitis type A and E with nutrients (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other blood and body fluid viruses (sperma, seal secret, snow).
In any case, passengers should be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, against type C vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after the use of infected food, usually associated with disturbance, weakness, abdominal difficulties, vomiting.
Then, on the skin and the eyes white men, yellow, light capital and dark urinary are created. The treatment may take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people in the world die on a more serious type of disease, a liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected medicine is treated.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of the infected diseases don't even know, the originators of the liver cells are exterminating, so the first symptoms will be delivered in many cases until 20-30 years.
That is why it is very important for a temporary prevention, for regular depisation.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than in the average: among those who have processed blood transfusions in 1991, between drug users and people with tattoo.
Currently, the global number of individuals infected with the virus of chronic hepatitis C 200 million is estimated.
Since the disease can already prove a routine laboratory study, a person should be turned to his practical physician if any symptom of unknown origin is observed.
In advance, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infections and preventing cancer.
On September 30th is the global day of hepatitis, which was first organized by sick organizations in the world in 2004.
His goal is to note the chronic hepatic inflammation caused by these viruses, the causes of its emergence and the importance of the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God doesn't hurt so much?
According to recent research, faith in gods is functioning as a certain analgetics that could make death easier for Catholic torturers.
Scientists at the Oxford University performed an interesting experiment, investigating how faith in the gods affects pain, the British Telegraph journal informed.
In a lot of bizarre research, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while everyone watched the painting displaying the Virgin Maria.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much pain.
The exploratory technique showed that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that was responsible for regulating the pain.
The study is the first of the series of studies that are attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The test was fully exactly tested by connecting a sparkling tool to the left hand of the experimental subject with electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to closely observe two paintings: Sassoferrat Panna Maria, originating in the 17th century, and the Lady with Leonard da Vinci, drawn in the 15th century.
The research authors hoped that the view of the Virgin Maria would cause a certain state of godlyness to believers, while Da Vinci‚Äôs image was chosen because it was not too different from the first and acted as a calming impression.
The test subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scan and during that time received four of the following parts of 20 electroshocks, while separately watching the image with religious or general theme.
The Catholics claimed that when they looked at Miss Maria, they felt "safe", as if they were "settled" and "relaxed, filled with peace."
When they watched the image with religious themes, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonard‚Äôs work before them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that such an effect can be achieved by any strongly impressive image and in the atheists, but it is just necessary to find a proper photograph.
"We should find a picture that will be considered very positively, from the position of the mother or father," the psychologist said.
The English Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research results.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases also change our personality," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only the question of how the painting of believers would be affected if they showed them some madonna from Leonard or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would it mean a view of the quality Virgin Maria to achieve even better results?
You're what you share
On his tenth birthday, Google can declare that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the heavens above their head; they know where they were on holidays, for what professional examinations are going and what they are interested.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the heads of the company, that's still not enough.
However, with regard to skeptics who are parallel with orwell's dark vision, these are not the very very bright essence of the website 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently expressed for the Financial Times journal that the main goal of Googlu is to gather more personal data about users, which is necessary to keep the founders of Googlu's original intention, which sounded: "Let's arrange all the information in the world!"
According to a confessed representative of Googlu, the company stands after ten years of world work only at the beginning of working with all the information.
On the question of what Schmidt will be in five years, he would like Google to answer questions like "what to do tomorrow?" or "What job would actually be useful for me?" - on such seemingly simple questions, however, the software will not be able to answer until they know enough about the users.
Not all users of the Internet know well that when searching for the Internet, the searches are precisely captured by the searched words and the IP addresses they were searching for and on which site the stakeholders have moved after searching.
Thanks to the Personalized Search Service started two years ago, users can, for example, preserve the history of their surfing, they can look back what they were looking for and what they clicked on, and then in a long-term perspective, generate findings adapted much more directly to them - on the same logic, the Recommendations service will also be based on the system on the basis of the previous and preserved preferences to offer products and services.
What if my data are used against me, what if someone looked at what I'm dealing with? - they ask users who are afraid of the Googlu data monopol.
In most cases, the scope of potential power represented by the company, the antireaction does not call on the users of the Internet awareness of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is confirmed that all the demanded expressions are not only incorporated but also may be issued by the third party in reasoned cases, in such legal cases, the personal rights of the Internet users are not protected.
The most famous example of the latter was, perhaps, coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, which provided Google to the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the municipal sites of Orcut, which was created by his.
However, Internet users who are concerned about personal rights could still breathe in May when the company with an EFF protection organisation successfully proved its truth in conflict with the FBI: Google cannot be forced to provide any information in the future by any member of the Constitution in order to provide any secretly requested FBI information.
(In the same time, the federal government has successfully combated nearly 50 thousand web addresses and thousands of searches that it has received with a remark for strengthening the years before the adoption of the Children's Protection Act, but it has failed to obtain lists of the items requested for individual users, respect for the full list of websites and key words covering the period of two months.)
The Google view is so disagreeable: it is bicised by those who fear to provide their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be using Google services, injured, and act against it with a revolt that belongs to transnational companies with a conservative image.
And in the meantime, the American geek culture and its wild bunch, grouping around the excited computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, seeing a new generation of greatfire, "corporation that is now freaking" in contrast with his rival of Microsoft, who is considered Windows as the world's conqueror, as they both fight for the same goals.
This can be caused by the fact that Google does not require the identification code from its users and does not want money after them for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and packages of programs operates as much more available, youth, "cool" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, it can also be caused by the geeks to understand the very problematic relationship with the Internet and personal rights that has just brought with them one of the most disobedient key words in recent years: web 2.0.
Because Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately keep tracks behind and use the communication channels we have available, and although their scope is in each other, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
A average young man can take a profile immediately on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm application, recording it with the listened music, can then connect all of this to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, but also write a blog on which his latest photogallery will be automatically discovered on Flickru or Picase.
Instead, we can learn about many examples of which it explores: a friend in the morning when seeing the flood of photos of common friends, we can easily find out with who her creepy friend spent the evening, or the company can only dismiss his employee because on his blog he can calculate his sincere view of top leadership: one is certain, the concept of private life has been completely overreased today.
The one living online life consists of what it shows itself, so we can define the basic theme that is hiding behind today's youth behaviour.
And who wants to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly, has the option (e.g. Scrooglem, who uses the Googlu search system, does not deliberately leave traces).
For example, a number of people are not on purpose registered on community sites so it cannot be found. Online applications Googlu from the text editor to the photographer and the reporting portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and which will not make us the best possible profile.
Public opinion is too secretly expected when Google shows teeth.
Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense‚Äôs advertising area threatens investments of advertising agencies and services constantly introduced with a accelerating rate seriously disadvantaged life not only to Microsoft but also to numerous other software designers.
Critical observers, however, also find contrasts that are disturbing the impression of the company: the top leadership, for example, completely rejected the protests of employees after doubled the fees for the company school, any common daily eating was too expensive in terms of the company's leadership, but all of this was lost by the fact that Google had been shocked before the Chinese government in 2006, and in the sense of their agreements, it filtered every finding that causes good taste, respect for the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds that it never initiates new services, only when it can be used, but it is sure that the expected problems of the next months and years can prevent the world from new places: while some believe that the Googlu project aimed at scaning and archiving books and magazines is acquiring such dimensions that the company will soon be dealt with the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of its health system, as we can draw up a complete health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is composing a genetic database, then it can serve as a good default material and for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the famous novel of Cory Doctor "Scroogled" describes with orwell's reminiscence future, in which a person can get closer to the scary, only using Google data.
Double killer from Ozd helped to remove the traces of two youths
Two youths have heard the police in the case of double homicide in Ozda, according to reasonable suspicion, helped to remove the leads of this crime, said the spokesman of the High Police Directorate of the Borsod.
Persons who have been suspected have learned and are now accused of promoting a criminal offence.
Both youths, according to the MTI information, are persecuted on free.
Assistance to criminal offence is punished by liberation for up to 5 years.
The suspect of double homicide in Ozdo, a 23-year-old man here, was taken to temporary detention on Sunday.
He's a suspect of a criminal crime planned several murders for some reasons.
During the investigation, a 23 - year - old man owed a 53 - year - old man more.
The suspect refused to pay his debt, so he dragged his creditor into the Ozdo office last Wednesday, where he first killed a man and then his nine - year - old daughter.
According to MTI, a young man was preparing to commit a crime, which is also evidence of the murder committed by a weapon hidden in the crime scene.
The weapons and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police by the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Storm offered a purchase of the Prague Bureau
Two hundred million euros -- approximately five billion Czech crowns -- offered a warsaw bureau of securities for the purchase of a 100 per cent package of the Prague stock market.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the President of the Warsaw Bureau of Price Papers, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party, even though the Czech Republic had excluded the Warsaw Bureau from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Bure earlier.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Bureau is standing.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that wishes to sell 60 per cent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech Economic Journal E15 writes, the offer of the Poles represents the highest amount that has been offered for the Prague Bureau.
According to Czech papers, the Vienna Bureau of Price Papers, Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, and Deutsche B√∂rse offered.
The chief of the Prague Action Bureau, Peter Coblic, expressed last week that the warsaw's bureau of securities would be the worst new owner of all the interested, and did not exclude that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Action Bureau in the future.
The value of the Prague market of securities is estimated by experts on the stock markets of 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock market is Patria Finance's investment bank with approximately 25% share, followed by the Czech Republic with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. and L.A. with 13.5%.
On the financial crisis from the view of European Letters
In their Tuesday comments devoted to an enhancing international financial crisis, the front European letters already remind "second September 11th".
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the American President, charged by Roman La Repubblica. The president has not even been able to settle his own party to support the fast-paid draft of the law, which aims to fix this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, reminded of a billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second September 11th.
The part of the Madrid press also sees a guilty in Washington.
According to the El Mundo journal, he has brought the world economy to the edge of the deficiency of political leadership.
The danger of the American financial system is constantly increasing, which will eventually pay the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after the vote in Congress, Washington is in danger of not offering a political solution to the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just the moment one of the biggest changes in capitalism.
The threat cannot be further distracted, indicates the Geneva journal Tages-Anzeiger.
Single States can still throw a rescue circle to incurring monetary institutions and taxpayers can save them from crash.
Nonetheless, if the domino bones fall, there will be no more money or other improvizations.
In a long-term perspective, Member States of the European Union should be transferred through their national egoism and united control of broken financial markets.
Only on Monday, more than 100 billion euros received posted monetary constitutions, the Vienna Der Standard recalls that the fear that, as the Americans will have to touch deeply into their pockets as well as European taxpayers, is increasingly more real.
The European Union has a crisis, which is as cunamis in the old continent, has not been seriously dealing with so far.
The "Saviers" must not be waving hundreds of billions of euros immediately, but it would be good to determine firmly, in which case it is reasonable to touch the money of taxpayers to prevent even more damage.
Intelligent car is imitating the fly of a bowl
What would be the best method to develop technologies capable of preventing the collapse if not imitating detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
For example, the bees.
The default strategic idea of a surprising project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC industry, embedded the engineers from the Nissan flippers. It was about how to build a new generation of systems preventing crashes.
In collaboration with the Tokyo University, Nissan developed a BR23C biomimetical system of management, robotized miniau, equipped with bees' properties, with a final purpose to help create a system that can eliminate all crashes.
"After the flight, each bee creates a personal space of a oval form, which is actually very similar to our security package," explained Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General for Technology PR and Research and Development.
The important role plays complex eyes that allow bees to see in all directions in the visual angle of over 300 degrees.
The complicated eye function was copied by engineers after the idea of a laser remote compartment.
It identifies the obstacles at a distance of up to 2 metres before BR23C in the visual field of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends to the board microprocessor the signal that immediately turns into an operation to prevent the crash.
The obstacle is captured during a second break, then the robotized car starts to imitate the bees' movements and turn wheels in the range needed to prevent the collapse immediately change the direction.
Unlike any existing system, this flexible maneuver is being carried out in an entirely instinctive way.
"If it wasn't, the robotic car would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Laboratory of Mobility and Robot Car Project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, because this technology is the most vulnerable and inner layer of the security package, which is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid the next bees.
This process shall not take longer than the eye blink.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot go up, down or down angle, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction to turn the wheels.
Instead of the infinite possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotating, acceleration and slowing was applied in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have longer life than lithium-iont variants.
According to Andoa, it is important instinct, intelligent response, not ability to process, but less data storage.
This mechanism must process and respond only to several arrival signals per second.
It is not necessary to store and react through intuitive logic based on the dates of the previous maneuvers, so it is constantly using memory of a few kilobytes size.
He doesn't need memories with giga or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step to develop technology that serves as an immediate avoidance, which, according to Nissan estimates, could get into serially manufactured cars within ten years.
Further possibility of applying may be the connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system that would lead the motorist to a definitive target after avoiding the road of the lying obstacles.
The damn dear child has a name
The Economy Rescue Package of 700 billion dollars, which is to be divided into several payments and which aims to buy insufficient bank loans, is already in writing.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
After further negotiations, which ended until Saturday after midnight of the American Eastern Time, the representatives of the Congress had reached an agreement within a few days of a lasting debate on a rescue package of $700 billion, the Reuters Agency reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the House of Representatives, which remains only the writing of the agreement.
The compromise on the package also supported both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The Minister of Finance, Henry Paulson, said about the outcome of the compromise, "The program will work and be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 a.m. at Washington's time (that is Monday at 2:00 a.m. in Central European Time), however, no special rise in the markets.
The proposal for a legal standard hearing on behalf of the Act on Emergency Economic Stabilisation of 2008, which the programme is to be established, will be voted first on Monday, then a series of representatives in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then the reports of the agreement were welcomed in the White House.
"We are satisfied with the progress made last night and we appreciate both parties' efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said the speaker of the White House, Tony Fratto.
The programme remains different from the original proposal of Bush's administration, in which the total amount of $700 billion should be made available for the purchase of unqualified valuable papers provided with hypothecies.
Now it can be spent in the first round half of the amount of 700 billion, by using 250 billion immediately after the case is expected on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will buy for them valuable papers provided by mortgages, which are estimated as unquality, the destiny of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the president's decision.
The programme will be monitored by a special congregation whose member will also be the President of the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of the Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactics: it can also buy inexpensive loans, mortgages and securities provided by hypotheses, respect for other "toxic" loans.
The ransom may take place within the auctions and directly, informed the competent representatives of the Ministry.
The Legal Standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in the insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance will provide guarantees for funds to be concerned, which will then pay the price of the expected damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system, up to 700 billion dollars, whether it is a large purchase of bad funds, their insurance or preventing the systemic risk associated with a decline in some of the large monetary institutions.
"We shall take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The boss of the banks who have gotten into trouble and are waiting for State's help, they can count on the fact that the government will reduce their departures - which is simply called "Gold Passage" in the Overseas Slang.
Their payments will only be limited in certain cases, in addition, these restrictions will depend on the way they assist the Ministry.
Constraints essentially means that if the Ministry buys in the auction, a tax tariff will be decorated on gold drops if the falling bank directors are not sent directly to retirement.
In the case of direct purchase of inadequate loans, the government will aggressively step to ensure that the money for leadership is not excessive.
It is necessary to add that the existing gold falling contracts will not be changed, the restriction concerns only new contracts, which should be another stimulation to participate in the programme.
"It is one of the first cases in the American history when legal restrictions on the remuneration of the Directors-General will be in force," the President of the Committee for Financial Services of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank, commented.
Furthermore, the State in the banks participating with the right to acquire a share, reducing the risk of taxpayers, as the economy and the saved bank can be earned with it.
The proposal plan includes that in the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to the Congress to determine how the taxpayers can recover the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, the two parties also showed voices in relation to the doubt plan.
"This is not what American citizens have asked us, because this is not what the dollar of taxpayers will protect," the Republican Congressman from California Darrell Issa said.
His democratic colleague from Ohia Mary Captur believes that exactly those responsible for the Wall Street crash were insisted on taking the provisions.

In comparison with July, the local sales prices in the processing industry also increased mildly by 0.1 per cent.
The largest increase in prices took place in August 2008 in the skin and shoe industry (2.8 per cent), in particular due to a monthly increase in prices in the production industry of brass and settlers by 4.6 per cent, respect for the production of shoes by 2.5 per cent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical and product production sector (1.6 per cent).
Prices decreased in oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as in the minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices in the paper production and publication and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the processing industry, we measured the price growth of 0.2 to 0.9 per cent.
In the production and divorce sector, electricity, gas and waters that are highly weighted in the industries in the country's removal, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, in particular by the continuing impact of the officially defined gas price increase since 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic removal in individual sectors of the processing industry, prices increased most in the oil processing sector (32.4%).
In the co-operating sector, 13,2 per cent were observed in the field of production of food products, drinks and tobacco products, which were decisive, then 11 per cent increase in prices.
The price reduction in the production sectors of textile and textile products (2.5 per cent) and the production of electrical machines and devices (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price growth rate was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 per cent during the past year.
The prices in the production and divorce of electricity, gas and water have overcome the prices of the previous year by 18.7 per cent.
In the light of the sharing of the sector, the highest monthly increase in prices (0.7 per cent) in the sectors involved in the production of material assets was demonstrated in August.
In the production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, in the processing and continuing processing sectors prices have not changed since the previous month.
The largest increase in prices due to the same month of the previous year was observed in the processing and continuing processing sectors in August 2008 (16.8 per cent).
In the consumption-producing sectors, we measured the price increase of 6.8 per cent, in the case of material assets, the price decrease by 1.4 per cent.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in forins in August compared to the previous month increased by 1.1 per cent, in the 12-month comparison, by 3.9 per cent.
In one month, our domestic payment decreased by 1.7 per cent in terms of the euro, and $7.1 per cent, compared to August 2007, increased by 7.5 per cent and $15.9 per cent.
Next year to the United States without a visa?
According to Kingy G√∂ncz, the great hope is that around 12 January the American and Hungarian Agreement on Wisual Relationship will enter into force, the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke of this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her opinion, "only everything is important now, if an electronic system of road permits is built in time."
At the same time, she noted that part of the new system would not be allowed to enter, however, tourists will have to be registered before leaving.
The representative of Hungarian diplomacy has been continuing in Washington since today.
He meets the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, who will transfer the Middle Cross to the Star of the Red for the credits of the Hungarian Republic, and conduct interviews with the advisors for foreign policy of the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for a package to save banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidential candidates of both large American parties, have similarly assured on Sunday their support for the government package for the saving of $700 billion, but they are also politicians who demand the demiss of the Minister of Finance.
After a several-day marathon of the Congress and Administrative Representatives, it was notified on Sunday early morning: a basic package for rescue of banks was concluded.
The financial package, aimed at translating the Wall Street crisis and the freezing credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are similarly referred to as a suitable one of both candidates to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent research, how the economic issue came forward, Obama again gained a certain advantage and the McCain's incentive, which was provided after the Republican Convention of the Nomination of Sarah Palin to the vice presidential post.
Obama expressed on Sunday at the Detroit election meeting hope that a package law would be adopted by the Congress of 700 billion quickly.
He emphasized that the proposal contains passages relating to consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We must act immediately, responsiblely... to your seats, savings, the whole industrial industry, the stability of the whole economy is at risk," he said before the 35 grand crowd.
He didn't miss the opportunity to call McCain's idea of the economy older.
McCain, in an interview with the ABC TV station, explained: "This will all be a little cause... but nothing is just a way."
As the Republican Senator stated in the proposal, the establishment of a committee of the supervisor of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the derogation for the superior representatives insisted on.
Obama for the CBS station declared that McCain had no more role in negotiations, but he himself was with the minister in daily contact.
The President of the House, Nancy Pelosi, reported on Sunday that the House of Representatives may vote on the proposal of the law on Monday.
Review of the printing of the German Language Area
The right camp is unbreakable, only the voters inside it have become more self-conscious - so it analyses the weak result of CSU in Bavorsk Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the left German reporting magazine, Franz Walter is discussing in his article entitled "Bavor Revolution will eat his father" causes of dramatic CSU defeat.
According to a famous politologist, the erosion of CSU started a long time before his office took over the sad duo of Beckstein-Huber.
Christian socialists have been renewing Bavorsko for decades - and these modern citizens are now being distracted from them.
The period‚Äôs arrangement is the problem of all Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
Debacl was not completely surprised for CSU, but the process was completed on Saturday, which could be assumed for almost ten years: an unsupported hegemony of one country.
The CSU landed at 47.7 per cent in 1998, for the first time since the 50s, under the 50 per cent border.
This was repeated three years ago at the elections in Bundestag in 2005, so still in the so often-reminded Stoiber period.
The reason for modernisation is that CSU has consistently performed in this country and eating its parents.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but they have been very mistaken. Secularization, results of education, residence of the Germans from the east and north in developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without the consequences of the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization is linked to the growth of options, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right camp is unbreakable, but the voters inside it have become more self-conscious, more critical, more strict.
It is also clear that the CSU has been the most distant in the past weeks; people in free profession, farmers, maturity individuals and high school education.
This already made CSU support lower than 40%.
Die Press (diapresse.com)
The Conservative Vienna Journal, in its article entitled "Who, who?" The Chairperson's parties are restraining" devoted to the confused internal-policy situation resulting from Austrian elections.
The SSP√∂ wishes to deal with √ñVP.
√ñVP shall prohibit the intervention of the SP√ñ in its internal affairs.
BZ√ñ seems open to all the proceedings, greens still don't want to deal with the coalition.
The elections are behind us, everything's turning around the coalition now; the debate held in public law television has not let the presidents of the parties look into their cards.
The President of SP√ñ Werner Faymann confirmed that he wished to deal with √ñVP.
And SP√ñ wants to show that the cooperation of both parties is certainly possible - in some common countries and in social partnership.
The question whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the √ñVP, as a vice-cancer, has left Faymann open.
As he expressed, Sch√ºssel-Molter's course was invoked for each fall.
Repeat of this direction is not considered.
Moltherer responded carefully to red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann try to interfere with internal matters of √ñVP.
Whether his party chooses opposition, or enters the coalition, is yet completely open on the side, these questions must be discussed within √ñVP.
The President of BZ√ñ J√∂rg Haider again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black coalition, we are ready to take over government responsibility," Haider said.
Jarokova: A charmed circle of poverty and segregation should be broken
In Paris today, the European summit of equality, which this year hosts France, the current presidency of the European Union.
Livia Jarokov√°, the Member of the European People's Party for the Movement of Fidesh, as one of the chief speakers of the professional promotion in her message addressed to the segregation in school, since it is one of the most important injustices to the Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
He started a top conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir ≈†pidla, European Employment Commissioner, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
In order to run, the invitations of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil associations acting in the area of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the European Embassy Group, Fidesz Jarokov√° pointed out that the Romas were expelled from the European labour market primarily the guilt of their low education.
"The major majority of young Roma does not have high school education and, as a result of the bad quality of basic education, only a small part of them can achieve higher degrees of education."
Jarocova further emphasized that education as a fundamental human right has a key role in applying other human rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member, awareness of these links must be established in the widest circles - between Roman and Nero children.
The sooner the Roma student starts school, the more likely it will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through taxes from income and consumption taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"Roma is the right of their nationality of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their quality and separate education," Livia Jarokov√° emphasized.
According to the Member, the cohesion of the European Union with a focus on the objectives and negotiations to accelerate the processes of desegregation of schools immediately, it is essential to keep the existing and planned anti-discriminatory regulations.
"The enchanted circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, the Roma children need to be provided with a democratic space to be able to participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," Jarokov√° requested.
Each is guaranteed in the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" objective of the European Summit of Equality, held annually since the last year's meeting in Berlin, to ensure a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and elimination of discrimination at the level of Europe and individual Member States.
CSU: temporary mercy
The destiny of the Dua of Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful election debacle, the debate on personal questions has been deferred to the top of the Bavorian CSU.
The President of the Erwin Huber and the Prime Minister of Earth, G√ºnther Beckstein can still stay in their seats, the question is, as long as this mercy lasts.
The fate of the Tandem, which has suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes, will decide on the last October weekend of the extraordinary convention of the party.
In any case, members of a very criticised dua have heard that they will not be able to get on their posts.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the fraction and the base, which because of the loss of the absolute majority, demanded a day after the "bavorian cunami" exemption of personal consequences.
Five years ago - the truth, even under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber on the top of her career - won the Christian-social Union 60.7 per cent, now, a year after the push against Stoiber, it was only 43.4 per cent.
In Bavaria, the CSU produced 18% of the German GDP "self-control" for 46 years.
Although conservatives still have a Southern merger country, which has a key importance for Hungarian economy, a high position, they will be forced to coalise in the future.
One of the first signs of reorganization within the party is that a member of the narrow intelligence team that starts a prosecution negotiation on the possible coalition of the monk's government with the liberal FDP, respect for the right-oriented assembly of the Free Elector, will also be the Vice-President and the Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, who is considered as a possible Huber's successor.
It is ironic that, at the candidate of the Free Electioners, Gabriela Pauli, whose controversy against Stoiber was used by the Duo Huber-Beckstein to carry out the pump, but then with an ambitious community political process, they made an unmilosrdly short process.
The leaders of the CSU are now focusing on how to stabilize Beckstein.
During the transitional period, the active role will also be played by Stoiber, who has already made the branches from the background, the former Earth Prime Minister and the former CSU president called the most oppressive day of his political career on 28 September.
On Monday, Huber had spent a few measuring notes to the CDU address, and he said they would have earned much greater support from the Sister's side.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections in Bundestag on September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become a chancellor if CSU, who played a significant role in the national success in 2005, will not be able to put together with the common forces.
According to Merkel, who has hardly hid her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the big Berlin coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: the treatment of injured CSU will not be easier, and the social democrat crisis continues.
The SPD has achieved 18.6% of the worst result since 1946.
Luka≈°enko: opposition - 110:0
In the Sunday elections, no opposition ambassador has reached the Belarusian Parliament.
This can be explained by Russian observers by prosperity and stability by the country led by Alexandr Luka≈°enka, however, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) by the illicitities that have occurred during the compilation of votes.
The OBSE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member Legislative Assembly of the 10 million country has missed the opposition well for ten years, the opposition associated under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before the elections yesterday was seriously hoping that Lucashenko, who had left on the basis of the change in the constitution in the elections with a debate in 2006 and the fourth renewal of its presidential mandate, this time "allow" to appear in the parliament by several opposition Members.
The OSS has dropped from the previously considered boycot.
In the background of the opposition expectations, Beltransgaz, owners of the countries through Russia, was increasingly dependent on Belarus - who wished to improve relations with the European Union, where, for the reason of the Belorusian political establishment of a valuable, anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high positions, the policymakers are not allowed to enter.
Release was earlier pointed out that the OBSE emphasized positive movements, not deficiencies, for example, the ban of a third of the opposition candidates.
The Monday Blue Report of the OSCE, however, had already exemptions to the campaign during which the opposition candidates could not in fact appear in the press, particularly that the opposition could not be present to the compilation of votes.
At the same time, the opposition makes it possible to feel only improvement in the political system: political prisoners were released and Minsk is willing to start with Moscow and in smaller confrontations, when he refuses to recognise from Georgia the South Osetia and Abkhazia, even if Russia, which is formed by Belarus on the paper of the alliance State, considers these two territories independent for a month.
"We have made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU began," our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevic said.
According to the opposition candidate from the presidential elections in 2006, it is desirable that it remains so, even though the "power to enter an unsignificant parliament of the only opposition member".
In view of the results of the opposition, it does not plan protest action, rather try to deliver its message to the electors on the need for economic reforms.
"We, of course, have a lot of problems, the opposition lists must be printed in Russia, distributed by the obstacle to local authorities, but I still see that the change supports more and more people, even among the elders," Milinkevic said, indicating that Luka≈°enk's regime, which considers its greatest success to create social security, does not consider the right or officially supported layers of pensioners.
"For the debt of the country and the growth of the commercial deficit is only a matter of time when the social security 'related silence of the cemetery' will fall down," Milinkevic judges.
In contrast to opposition policy, Russian election observers evaluated as democratic.
The head of the Community's independent states Sergei Lebedev of the Russian Rapporteur Agency Ria Newsty said that "many don't believe words but acts", so the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the maturity of the Belorusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today's breakfast before work"
It's the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace, the rotating doors were introduced at the arrival and departure of employees.
But from now on, this new measure is going to work against the witty people, against those who bite and then go for coffee at worktime.
The news against the lenches was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidential Council, Maurem Masi.
"Oriental doors," says Brunetta ‚Äì are a tool for better work, higher performance, more gifts and more services," the Minister states.
"Now a new period of responsibility and transparency will be opened.
It's reformism," Brunetta also stresses.
By the Chigi Palace, we will complete the introduction of the Council's presidency in all buildings.
For Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic perspective".
No objections were made by the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "The procedure was common with workers and cooperation of all."
Just, no more breakfast at work time; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a real cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During a conference at the Public Administration High School
in Rome, the Minister will eventually notify that within three months the absence of public personnel for the disease decreased by 50%, which means 60,000 more people per year at work."
And it adds that it is necessary that the Italian public administration become more effective
"His paying dynamic, explains the Minister, has doubled in the last 8-10 years, in view of the private sector and is far higher than the inflation percentage."
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees were gathered to reject Brunett's standards in accordance with the Codacons' request.
"While the Minister of Public Administration today presents the numbers relating to the lower absence of work for disease," says the consumer protection association ‚Äì the nation of 'peaking lions' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in the public administration who have gathered to declare war to the illegal standards contained in the decree."
In particular, Tara will be protested against the exclusion of supplies to the hospital which depends on activities; the extension of the time where the sick can be checked in which time limits will be performed and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Work damages, Napolitano: "Resolute Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2.500 work damages, three persons die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
The Inail values confirm that in 2007 we have approximately 1.200 deaths due to work damages.
These values indicate the seriousness of the case, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes nearly double deaths compared to murders.
In order to re-emphasize the institutions, social and information tools on this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions the 58th national day of victims of work damages established on Sunday in October.
"The alarming data extended by Anmil and the same tragic reports of these days confirm the importance of the safety of work," says President of the Republic of Georgio Napolitano in the report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for Crushed and Disabilities for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses its alive admirement to the continuing joint efforts to ensure safety in the workplace, to protect the injured workers, to help victims' families and to participate in public opinion."
"Naturally, a disturbed 'do' was raised, sincerely divided by the face of tragedy, which causes disturbance in the media and the participation of the public opinion, but the daily fact offers us again dramatic cases, even repeating in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt the problem of sources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Special importance is made by numerous educational initiatives to make young people facing the world of work clearer awareness.
This phenomenon is needed to be noted, not to give up because of its anxious social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber emphasized, "as the deaths resulting from a working injury creates an absolutely critical social condition, as insults the conscience of each of us, and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the necessary end of this condition."
"As for working injuries, they seem to be reporting a positive turn, but this does not deny that the number of deaths due to the injury of work is just as alarming," President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli reiterated.
"We wouldn't really want this "degradation effort" to lead to less attention, because just the moment he's stopped, the tragedy will occur.
"We believe that generally it is not enough to stop the problem of injuries and there are many activities that may affect this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion, to emphasize Mercandelli ‚Äì to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more in the field of training of workers from the age of school."
"There is still a need for further effort -- he added ‚Äì about communication and public opinion co-operation.
But it is essentially needed to make more sense of responsibility by employers against the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli eventually declared that it was a progressive degeneration of the right to compensation for work victims and the "sustainable care" that the system has been receiving in recent years.
"The purpose is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the employee," he added ‚Äì because the fate of those who injure themselves must not depend on spontaneity or gift from time to time by lawmakers."
Mp3 players accused, exposing risk hearings
Listening for longer time to a loud music and using transmitting music instruments as Mp3 players can blame the persistent destruction of the hearing.
According to today's notification of the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the Committee on Science on Health Risks, which have recently been raised and identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"From this scientific opinion ‚Äì we read in notes ‚Äì shows that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years using transmitted musical devices, weekly more than an hour daily and maintain a high-speed device, risk a permanent loss of hearing power."
"I am concerned that so many young people who often use transmitted musical devices and mobile phones at high acustical levels can unconsciously damage their hearing in an unrepairable way," Meglena Kuneva admits.
"Scientific findings, continued by the leader, have a clear risk and need to be responded quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to stimulate consumers and publish these information.
We must continue to verify the already existing control systems in the light of this scientific discovery so that they become fully effective and keep their steps with new technologies."
Brussels requested the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of transmission instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists ‚Äì concluded by the executive official of Eu ‚Äì confirm that it is necessary to worry and now the European Commission will check together with other members and parties which have raised the problem, what measures could eventually be taken and thus better protect children and young people from noise exhibits, whose originators are the transmitted musical instruments and similar devices."
At present, there is a security standard that limits the noise of the transmitted musical devices to 100 dB but increases concerns about hearing damage, which can be caused by overexposure of similar noise forms.
It is very possible to limit these damage by searching for solutions such as the reduction of the level and the duration of exposure.
In its conviction, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that the users of transmitting musical devices, if they use a loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will exceed the current valid limits corresponding to the maximum allowed noise on the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer time risk a permanent loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should be affected by 5-10% of users of such devices and their quantities can be calculated between 2,5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, Alemanno leaves a free progress to the Commission for the future of the capital
We'll start today, we'll close in March, we'll have the sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli workers "The Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome", which met this morning in its new village behind the Caracall Bath.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the committee will draw up leaflets for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, Gyunta and the General Council will assess the analysis and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with Campidoglia and his council Giannio Alemann in June.
"The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural thoughts are included ‚Äì he wants to emphasize Alemanno ‚Äì he will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political judges remaining in Giunta e General Council.
It's not about exchange of functions, it's only an effort to have some place to process a large project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then solved, because this institution must have a precise time term.
In June ‚Äì the mayor announces ‚Äì we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
The one who accuses the Commission of inadequateness, given that its opinion is not binding, Alemanna answers: "All matters to the work that the Commission will be able to do and to the quality of their proposals.
If they are qualitative and like the Commission Attali proposals, and I'm sure in Rome, its benefit will be decisive.
Too often, politics will repay on daily problems and emergencys that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
Furthermore, mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that "This Commission is not either a useless business or a blef: it is completely free, Roman citizens will not cost euros and serve to think and involve the best intelligence that the capital has."
For Alemann, in fact, "needs to have a strategic drawing as a default point, neither definitive nor imminent to allow our city to afford an authentic rise at the level that it needs, and to think with a united spirit of his future."
The future, which, as stated by Mayor Rome, "will not only be limited to the current general border, but will look far further" not only in the option of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of the capital, but "to include the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A famous American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam."
The attacks on Obama are growing just when the election date is coming.
One lady from Miami wrote on the web, "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has anger: he thinks he will get to the highest position of the nation who had two governors and five black senators everywhere."
In fact, these attacks do not say much," they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then we have research; they all say Obama will win and with a great prospect.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart, not according to the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the womb of the South of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the electoral cabinet we know who will give his voice to the American patriot.
One page of American mentality that remained scattered until the last minute.
Say what you want, we'll finally take care of it ourselves, who to check out if Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama had won, we'd leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, almost a certain success of a black candidate.
But over all these views for democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
1500 people asked: what mistakes did Bush during his mandate? Eighty nine percent responded: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers, and they sent him home with a battery in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were saved and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became most of Bush's weakness.
Whoever enters Georgia W will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the United States has also been felt by journalists: there is an investigation period in the newspaper, and many accuse the Internet, the " killer" of press.
The PEW Research Center asked about the state of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Well, today almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the questions openly did not say that they were less concerned about confidentiality.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem is money for American journalists, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crise of a destroyed economic model.
Besides, the cuts carried out in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put together the newspapers are a huge problem.
According to the questioned journalists, it is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to be changed as the wide public understands it.
The American journalist has a clear, but complex pessimism.
Six of the ten press journalists and seniors are convinced that the journalist is in the national way wrong.
There's a 65% performance group in the local area.
Printed against the broadcast.
It's not difficult for the journalists to see where the web goes.
The larger publisher is going to travel to the Internet, which many view as a "killer" press.
"Economic pressure", which journalists are noting, has increased by 79%.
Five hundred questioned journalists have admitted that they're reluctant to technology in hope that for their journalist, they will "do something good".
The biggest ruin in American journalism is among those who run the newsrooms ‚Äì that means the leaders ‚Äì and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value falls to 23%.
This has something to do with "specific work."
The leaders who think they're losing their job within three years are 47% nationally.
As for the journalists, they're moving 30%.
With regard to "the same work" regarding our staff (nas editors, ndr) in America is still on a daily basis.
Only 13% of the journalists are working on the contract.
In such an enormous nation as Usa, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and Internet employers often offer what they want, so they are questioned to take or leave.
The leaders receive almost always huge wages and the editor can also earn $10,000 monthly off the pension and insurance payment.
As regards holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, often sick during one year.
It's just a climate question.
UNIPOL: SOD IN RIM, COPOLA DANILO ALL IN GROTTAFERAT
The President of the second Criminal Senate of the Rome Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the application of a businessman with realities of Daniel Coppoly, who asked him to move from his city, Grottaferrats, to the apartment in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-purchase of Unipol-Bnl sales.
During the process on its own costs, he was released from home prison last week, which was converted to forced permanent stay in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michel Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked for a businessman with realities to change the place of residence from the village city to the capital.
However, according to the Court of Justice, this movement (against which he has expressed pm) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Ellites in danger
This phenomenon has already been manifested several days ago when the Comoro of representatives voted against a rescue plan to provide $700 billion to the White House presented: a major part of the Americans was more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
It is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, who informs us that the current crisis is shaking the Republican party, constantly divided between its old soul East Coast, a mild, suitable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is conservative, enemy to the part of Washington, and the world of finances, stronger in the middle and south.
The soul that was arrogantly manifested by the vote I spoke at the beginning.
However, this is just an example of changes, major changes that the current economic earthquake already shows : not only in the United States, but in the entire West, and perhaps not only here.
As in Usa, as well as in Europe, this crisis seems to work as an accelerator of the phenomenons that have been in the incubation for a long time, which have been exhausted in the new climate and finally emerged into light.
The first of these phenomenons is the renewal, the extraordinary market recovery, the double category of State power in relation to a certain reintroduction of the economy.
The crisis is, indeed, a crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong bonds in abroad, but are mainly included in the largest budgets of people and families living in one country, in one country.
Which created a political problem at the same time for those who are leading him: it means how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families, which, among others, are the electors.
Simply the crisis appears economically, but politically almost exclusively national.
The political internationality seems to be significantly out of the game or there is nothing to add: the obvious evidence has given the European Union, which is divided as always between the various interests and different state strategies and which cannot be decided for a common political line.
So everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each country, the saving plans, the recovery of the market, new rules and mainly the division of funds: when we get into trouble, only the countries have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to try to make everything right.
As well as its own necessary funds and authorizations to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances, which no market and no international organisation will ever be able to possess at a similar extent.
This new emphasis, which the crisis puts on the national and national element, is ultimately in conformity with the growing importance that the last economic progress is attempting to contribute to a closely connected factor with it: territorial property.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we entered the kingdom of the site, more sophisticated technologies, materials, while we were convinced that world finances were already pre-determined to rule the world, we realized nothing that our future would have to deal with more and more and more with small things like water, grain, oil.
All things that would say that can be transported from one place to another, but in any case, they are connected, absolutely, to the border area, the territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler, surely has a lot more cards in his sleeve than who's not and who's lucky to live in a place without grain, without oil and no water.
I'm getting to the second news, but it's predicting a fracture.
Who speaks of the territory, the state, the government, is inevitably talking about politics, i.e. leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, two convergent phenomenons seem to be created.
On the one hand, awareness that the objective requirement for authority leadership is a request for someone who can take the situation.
On the other hand, the wave of discreditation against existing leadership, in particular economic, which has proved equally unsuitable and full of dark places.
And together something even deeper and in a sense of disturbing: discreditation, impatience, feelings of incapability and absence that are trying to control the whole class in the western countries.
Because it seems that it is increasingly wider in the mass of the population of beliefs than that their actions are the same as the ideas of the popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the right sense of the word that the elite has already overcome its time and is indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The requirement for leadership simply feeds one branch from the underground, but the strong movement to remove the ruling classes and traditional political arrangements is manifested in the urgent elections "resistances" or in unexpected changes in collective moods in the last and last time, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorska to the fall of labourists in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American Congressors against Bush (and perhaps the winning of the right in Italy).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremony, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have increasing problems to understand, so represent, which, not from today, is created in deep layers of Western companies and that the economic crisis reinforces, grows, potentially overwhelming.
Before this, it would be overwhelmed to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion".
But we can't definitely say that it means having real eyes open.
Super glue for walking around the walls
To overcome the laws of gravity thanks to the super glue and in the future to walk around the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centres, and now the team of four institutions has closed very closely to it.
Scientists managed to keep a stokilogram body sticked on the vertical wall with a sticker of only 2,5 square inches.
STUDIUM ‚Äì The American Science magazine published discoveries of some researchers in Dayton, Acrone, the Georgian Technology Institute and the Research Laboratory of Air Force.
The material that has invented a team of researchers is the development of materials already existing that use a special carbon structure called carbon tubes.
‚ÄúThe foundation of glue can be imagined as a series of pipes placed as a organized bunch of spaghetti‚Äù explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Technology Institute in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of the gecon, covered by microscopic hairs that allow animals to ensure perfect scratch.
The tests performed on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper showed that the new sticker is ten times stronger than the legs of these plazes and at the same time "with simply falls away from the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher of the Dayton University.
"This material could be useful as a visual glue" adds Liming Dai.
Hopefully, the researchers are thinking of much less fascinating use as the connection of electrical devices, because the dwarf carbon tubes are the heat and electric energy guides.
Other applications may concern air space engineering .
So far, no super heroes.
FURTHER STUDIES ‚Äì Also, the University of Berkley, California, is conducting research on a new glue.
In one article of American Chemical Society, California scientists presented a glue formed from micro fibres as hair cleaning themselves from dust by moving around the surface to keep perfect adjacentness.
Medicines: Never with juices
Watch the grep, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks that are primarily consumed in the summer, because they are refreshing and filled with vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their use is changing or reducing efficiency with serious health effects.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, emphasizes the risks of juices both finished and fresh in combination with the use of some medicines, at just the 263th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, causes a new alarm: one glass of grep, orange and apple juice to reduce the infiltration of some lives of saving medicines, to cancel their useful effects and exposure to the risk health of patients.
The grep juice has already been accused that it is responsible for increasing toxic effects of some anti-aritmical medicinal products, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihystamine and neurological medicinal products to the toxicity level.
THE MEDICINAL RIZIC ‚Äì The Italian Medical Agency itself notified it in the information bulletin two years ago and embarrassed doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers resulting from this mixture and to take care of what they drink in case they take medicinal products, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NEEN GRAPEFRUIT ‚Äì According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress medicinal products.
A long list of effects impaired by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the challenge of Michel Carruba, Director of the Pharmacological Division of the National University in Milan: "Those appearances are mostly notified to the various international and national pharmacists which eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicinal products.
So you always read the illustrative cards of the medicines you get and if you encounter something incredible, don't disturb yourself, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification," the expert for Ansa emphasized.
Economy Nobel Paul Krugman
The Nobel Price was allocated to the American Paul Krugman for his research of commercial models and location of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenian who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a famous editor of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important criticisms on foreign, economic and political steps of Bush's administration.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, the day he crashed Enron, Krugman foretold in one comment issued in New York Times that the second event would, in the sense of the consequences of the history of the United States, be much more important than the first.
The prophecy that had caused no dispute and which had been argued over the years, but it turned out to be precise.
"I am surprised and shocked with the speed of collapse such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from public interest, Krugman declared at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Biniho Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is ‚Äúeconom of great importance‚Äù, but also a popularist who has a very aggressive style, especially critical against the excess of Bush's liberalist administration‚Äù.
Open Office, we have the third issue of the "anti-Microsoft" here.
It is the day of publication of Open Office.org 3.0, a package of open source of personal production that aims to prosecute more users, from household to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative of the more famous Microsoft Office.
After some year's work of voluntary workers controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows a wide public with various news: to welcome the screen and to the revised and improved opening window, additional, far more important, such as the compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support of the new format of ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last standard version of ISO.
The emphasis is also placed on collaboration with the Office package 2007, Open Office is able to open the document with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are specific functions of some models such as that allowing to reduce the sizes of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for the transfer of electronic path, or the possibility of transfering PDF component into the graphical implementation model and preserving the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create documents "PDF hybrids", which look like typical graphics of the Adobe format and have the properties of the table processor or the text program.
Cooperation is a element that has obtained many improvements within the application programs: in excellent, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, each colleague is assigned to a single color to comments to make it clearer identification in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on the transfer of some of the Open Office functions on the Web (on the cloud), and the following weeks should stop the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version of the mirror since Friday.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, the package is usually available for Linux operating system.
Also the installation cd may be sent home or workplace on request.
And if the theme of freeness can be a trigger to expand in households, it is a lot of betting in the Open Office business and can already count on various projects implemented in public governance and schools.
And there are no offers of training, consultation and assisting services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open commercial perspectives.
Open Office is composed of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacement Word; Calc is a table processor to replace Excel; Impress for presentations similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, eventually, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and considering that we are nearly 3 million and 600 thousand today, with a new version, it is possible that this estimated number can be overcome.
Also Kohl's results are positive, it's a fourth doping case.
New positive case on the last Tour de France: this is Rakusan Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and the winner of the shirt of the best superior.
The report quoted the L'Equipe journal pages.
The 26th-year-old Kohl is the fourth racing player positive for Cera, Epo third generation, after Italy Riccard Ricco and Leonard Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall into those carried out in the last week of the Labs of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabra.
If the control analysis confirms the positiveness of Cera, the Rabbit will lose the third place in the Tour and will have to face the two years of disqualification.
The report on the positiveness of Kohl on the Epo third generation confirms the chief of the French Anti-Doping Agency Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he has already informed the results of the Austrian government.
The 26th-year-old Rakusan was placed on the degrees of winners behind Spain Carlos Sastr and the American Cadel Evansema, also got a thorough shirt of the best superior.
IMMIGRANTI: New York Teams is sought, is it Italian Rasist?
Italy "as the country of emigrants only in the last house has turned into a priority target of immigrants" adopted with resistance.
This converts a beautiful country to a nation of racists? That is how one long article in New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy, began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre originating in Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of cookies.
This case shows what New York Times defines as a "paradox to the north," the northern regions are at the same time the ones where more integration and more work are registered, but also "the strongest anti-employment opinion in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
In order to confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT quotes cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturn.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by Lego, which is trying to stop immigration and facilitate exile of illegal immigrants, is also quoted as an example of changing climate in Italy.
The tendence emphasized by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after he met Benedette XVI in Quirinala, asked the state and the church to work together on the defeat of racism."
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students doesn't know the crisis.
According to recent surveys, Sunya, rental committees, renting a single room can cost a student in Milana up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Neapoli 650, in Rome 600.
"Jev has already achieved such dimensions that all layers of students have lost the right to study because of a total of too high prices that their families would have to bear," explains the Sunia Study Directors, Laura Mariani, in this city, a large demand by students has deformed the market in such a way that it has initiated the process of increasing prices, which has also been expanded to residents."
In most cases, rental offers include several offences: contracts freely, unregistered, without limited rent, connected rents.
Sunji needs a special intervention that could regulate prices through a tax revision.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for a single bed of about 450 euros, a single room is paid from a minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) over the average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to the maximum 900 (in Vittoria zone).
In Florence there is one bed in the average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones near the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a double bed, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome in central university zones (San Lorenzo, Bologna piazza) they want approximately EUR 600 per single room, 450 beds in double bed.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per single) in zones near other universities (Ostience and Cinecitta).
We save only if we move into peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room of Prenestina, Centocelle, etc.
In Neapoli, 300/450 euros are needed for bed, room from 400 to 600 euros, with highest prices in the Zones of Policelinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, they want 250/350 euros for bed, at least 350 per single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have more impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most frequent rental for students from countries outside the European Union, one other anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of approximately 25-30% of the fee they want after foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old cinema, Paradiso, cities ruin historical halls
The kinematographic historical halls are closed for Multiplex.
"The place without movies is as blind as a face without eyes."
The picture offered by the director Giusepp Tornator successfully documents what is going on in the large Italian city centres and rural cities.
The process of cinema constraints, the birth of large multisals in the suburb and the next disappearance of monosales in central urban zones is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and unauthorized but also has all signs of real cultural crime.
It's like we're losing a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of road and a lot of emotions," the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that 20 years ago won the Tornator Oscar and the great price of the jury in Cannes, and who told the poetry of a village movie and a sadness about the way of life that the movie probably lost forever.
The values obtained by Anecem, the main operator association, are clear: in the last five years, the doors of 316 kin of traditional tips have been closed, and the highest account paid mainly rooms in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milana, Neapoli, Bologni and Rome, 6 less in Torino, 5 in Palerm.
Among the most infected regions, Emilia-Romagna is at first with the loss of 82 movie rooms followed by Toskana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And the proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is a multix, are these three Italian regions that registered the highest number of new film multisals: 195 paid more in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Toskania and Emilia-Romagna.
‚ÄúItalian procedure has developed irrationally‚Äù says Paolo Protti, President Anecu, is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that these existings will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all his visitors are willing to move into multiple.
Then let's not even talk about insufficient fund funds for operators: the previous state debt is approximately 10 million euros.
In terms of moral and ethical, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to support the sector, it would be necessary between 16 and 18 million euros a year."
Interesting is the Bologne case, the first Italian city that is concerned with the closers and which decided to find an exit by signing the protocol between the villages and Anece, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small movies both in the historical centres and in the suburb.
Among the planned standards are tax relief steps for operators and benefits for the audience regarding mobility: the audiences will be able to light into a limited transport zone and will have special prices to stop and on certain parkings.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore and I hope that other cities will follow the example of the Bologna by introducing other measures."
But it is sure that in order to confront the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more difficult.
The defense of a traditional movie is a theme that was always important: the closing of the Super movie in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescentship, was a spark that convinced me to build "New Cinema Paradiso", which I've been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I've been passing before already closed Rialt or Quirinal in the Naziionale Street, where I have shared so many emotions that I don't have to look at signs of black dust, I'll turn on the other side."
Relationship between politics and the mafian group 'andranghet, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The old man from Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the elections of the city office according to the interests of the Pyromalli mafian group."
The charges that the Directorship against Mafia in Kalabria are charged against the Mayor and Deputy Chief Gioie Tauro Dal Torrione da Rosari Schiavone, and to Mayor Rosarn Carlo Martellim, in prison this morning for external cooperation with the mafian organization, are difficult.
In the liaison, also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandchildren attorney, named boss, already accused of committing mafian crimes, condemned to compensation for 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as a healthy mind," state representatives wrote when two local administrations expressed their willingness to pay for counsel to Piromallim.
"This would allow the mafia group, as the judges write, officially enter the city offices and facilitate so much of the control and governance of public administration."
The President of the Calabrian Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, does not argue that "the secret agreements between local institutions and organized criminal subworld are much in its area: "The regions where the focus of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have a lot of local politicians who resist the pressures of 'andrangets, heroes who are still unfair.'
The imprisonment of this morning follows after the July last year's imprisonment that the police showed that the Pyromalli mafian group had been finalized .
Since the end of April last year - the City Council of Gioi Tauro has already been dissolved since 1991, the reason for the alleged connection between organized crime and local administration was also abolished by local politicians in the general administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of Christian democrats, who was elected by the head of the right center coalition after a higher choice in May.
He screamed about the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the general council to dissolve.
He called for the responsibility of the Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marc Minni, and accused him of all being based for political reasons, but the judges in the prison Regulation signed this morning explain that the mafia group had grown even so far that they asked for a change in the road project A3.
From other interrogations directed to Dal Torrion, the public prosecutor writes, it shows "willing to move the rights of the entrepreneur, the representative of some larger group very close, as it is known, to Piromallimu and to adapt the choices of public administration to the interests of the Mafia group".
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones enter the game.
It is an infinite bed that covers more than 70% of the earthly surface and now it begins to be discovered by large world energy companies.
Waves, streams, flows, flows are new sources of unexhausable energy, on which the vision of coloses such as Chevron, who is now trying to raise hands on these sources.
The ability to create energy from sea movements has been studied for over a hundred years and in the 1970s, research has increased.
When the oil price decreased around 1980, the idea of the use of marine energy went sideways. But now the environmental organisations and the new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new impulse.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 declared that approximately 15 percent of the world's energy consumption could be covered by the use of sea waves.
This quantity would be a double energy that is currently manufactured in nuclear centres.
Furthermore, there are streams and flows and flows.
The giant attacks.
The company that bet on the sea energy was Enercis, which agreed to build an installation in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this purpose was announced, it seemed a huge revolutionary step.
After two years betting on marine energy, more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technology of the oceans ‚Äì a speaker of a company connected to the United States' oil coloss, in the economic daily newspaper Wall Street Journal ‚Äì and thinks about the possibility to cooperate with us."
Cooperation that we consider applies to obtain authorisation from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to break down the sea energy project in Alaska.
We can't underestimate this signal, especially if we take into account that just on the US Alaska continues to weigh oil, and President Bush has recently come up with a plan for a new diversion.
In addition to Chevron, the sea energy trails and Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and yet invested amounts, even though they are not detailed, show the increasing interest in observers.
Technology, because it needs to be designed.
The experts are talking about technology that is still in the beginning, because they do not know how much marine energy will be affected by the use of the environment.
So far, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and it does not seem to cause great problems to ecosystem.
However, more energy production needs to be used with technologies with a greater impact on the media.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses the paint system that is connected between each other.
The force of waves that move with fights up and down is changed by means of wars and cylinders to hydraulic pressure within these fights.
The pressure streams the turbine that delivers energy to the generator.
Energy gets on the shore with submarine cables.
Meanwhile, there are four projects of this type which are only waiting for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is now making energy for the Shopping Centre and Parking, using six pdmore turbines in New York East River.
The water movement during the fluid and the fluid causes the turning of turbines that this rotating movement feeds the generator.
Verdant expressed that they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorization for the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the fluid, and after the wave.
The special interest at this point deserves the potential of fluid and flush, they say in the Institute for Electric Energy Research.
Although it is an independent factor, the flow and the fluid are more predictable than the wind, sun or waves, and it is also more reliable as a source of energy.
It's just influenza and pouring into the energy of the countries like New York, Maine and Alaska, and with other coastal States already invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and foretold up to $35 million per year in 2009.
