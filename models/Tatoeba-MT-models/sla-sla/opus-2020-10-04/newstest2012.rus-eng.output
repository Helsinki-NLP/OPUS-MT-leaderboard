Parliament does not support the amendment of the freedom of Timošenko
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, while amending the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected an attempt to repeal the article that condemned the opposition leader, Julia Timošenko.
The amendment that would result in the release of the former Prime Minister's prison was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on the mitigation of the convictions for economic offences.
In October, Timošenko was sentenced to seven years of prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was considered uncomfortable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timošenko in December.
Timošenko claims that the sentence is a political place of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of prejudice.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to ratify it.
Libya's victory
In the history of the release, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Caddafi was buried somewhere in the desert, and without it the war ended.
It is time to identify winners.
In general, Islamists win in the country; the question is, moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the customary law of Shariat, which we have already heard.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the stealing penalty is a hand cut.
Women may forget the emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of the dictator, the society consisting of competitive clans will be united by the Coran.
There will be a order in Libya, which we cannot imagine, and which we would hardly wish.
Nevertheless, our lifestyle is not the only one in its kind or best, and it would probably not suit Libya’s population.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic warriors have received assistance from the unbelievers.
Their only excuse is the fact that they believe that the nature of the NATO was guided not by the American General, but by Allah, whose greatness they praised after each strike.
And if we find winners in Libya, the West doesn't belong to them.
We have participated in shootings, served in Islam, and our policies have relieved the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
In view of recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to renounce Libya's military occupation.
The local population should therefore not be concerned about the exile of crossmen.
Although, without occupation, would oil companies receive the black gold of Libya for almost no price?
And then the West will finally be able to squeezeze the unselfish protection of civil rights.
Unless Sharia's followers end this.
A new wave of crisis is initiated
France and the rest of Europe are currently in the centre of investors' attention.
The statistical storm went over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries published GDP data in 3 blocks.
In comparison with the previous quarter, the Czech economies were in a stallion, and Germany and France have demonstrated growth.
Still, the debt market is beating records today.
Investors are not only looking towards Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The Eurozone Statistical Bureau in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries announced their preliminary assessments of economic development in the third quarter.
GDP of Germany increased by 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries have also adjusted the data on the second quarter where the cases were better than expected in Germany (0.3 per cent growth instead of starting 0.1 per cent). France reported a small decrease, by 0.1 per cent (remarkable information suggested stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy has shown preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous GDP block, the Czech Statistical Bureau confirmed the trend of gradually slowing economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of the year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was in a delay comparison with the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's economy increased by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the eurozones and the European Union have demonstrated an increase compared to the previous quarter by 0.2 per cent, compared with the forecasts of analysts.
Greece's economy demonstrated a preliminary reduction by 5.2 per cent.
The income of its 10-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
The income of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, and so on.
Despite the deterioration of the situation in the region, the income of Czech 1-year bonds remains approximately 4%.
Germany says that the ECB is the last creditor that can save the situation.
The Czech Assembly took the election to the EURO.
In Montenegro, they won with account 1:0 and celebrated the unexpected 200 million monetary prize.
The national team has successfully managed the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and the beautiful naked Peter Yiraček, they won with account 1:0.
In the second time, the Czech team was happy to retain a significant advantage after the home-responsive match, and it would take part again in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz observed the match and made a detailed report.
Almost nothing special in the first time and great luck in the second.
The Czech National Assembly, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the Great Czech Republic; and the heroic Yiraček; win 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates the entrance to the European Championship.
The excellent defence of the Czech team allowed the Montenegro team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovic and Vučinic became the most unfortunate couple of matches after they missed two great opportunities.
Great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech National Assembly will not miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
The game has been very tense since the first minute.
Both teams experienced difficulties in conducting combinations; the game was most of the time in the center of the field.
This also explains the absence of pressure from the first time team, and further strikes behind the defence line were carefully captured by Czech defenders.
The Iranian students are willing to die for the nuclear programme of their country.
They created a live shield.
Several hundred students of the university have created a live shield around the nuclear power station in Iran.
They therefore wished to express their support for the nuclear programme of their country against the possible attack by Israel.
On Tuesday, at noon, a request for death was followed by the students before the entrance of the building.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred universities have established a live shield around the Isfahan Enrichment Factory.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country's nuclear programme at the price of their own life.
In its last report, the International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that it was all evidence that Iran had not left an attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
Possible nuclear attacks in Iran were discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday, at noon, the students prayed before the entry into the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Factory followed a request for death both in the United States and Israel.
In the case of the attack aimed at the maximum paralysis of the Iranian nuclear programme, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, the installation in Isfahan and in Natanza, where the enrichment of uranium is carried out.
Nutrition of children suffering from fatty: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than three children aged 9 to 13 are weighing more standards; while 9 per cent of schools are overweight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to the last study, children suffering from abnormality usually originate from families who have a healthy lifestyle.
We again see the importance of the environment and the models of conduct that accompanie humans for their or its healthy development.
For example, the sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from fatty almost twice as in families with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of the children suffering from obese eating potatoes for dinner after an educational survey, named Obesity, is not a coincidence.
Furthermore, the families of children suffering from obesity do not sport, but this concerns most of the families of modern schoolmates - only 15 per cent of their children said that their parents have time for at least once a week for sports.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of the last year’s study; it was attended by nearly 900 primary classes throughout Bohemia.
The Activities of Fatty was not a coincidence of the second year in a sequence, with the support of the insurance company the Unilever General Health Insurance and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 classes have joined the project.
The right nutrition and sufficient sports load are the main factors of the rapidly growing number of children suffering from either overweight or obesity.
"For example, only half of the surveyers said they eat five times a day, on breakfast-law-to-fast, and it is one of the unchanged conditions of proper food," the study concludes.
No lunch and no sausage at evening.
Experts warn that even relative details such as the permanent family breakfast are important to healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of the school families are breakfast together.
In most families, everyone breakfasts separately.
The worst discovery was that in each tenth family people do not breakfast at all.
However, breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The study showed that roasted food is often used in families with children suffering from fatty.
Almost every one, regardless of weight, drinks sweet cooling drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children are regularly at sports, this number is reduced more than double - to 15 per cent - when it comes to their parents.
Create your own menu.
In another part of the study selected by children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) it was proposed to make their own menus based on the proposed products and based on their tastes and preferences.
"The preferred food in Czech children aged 12 to 15 years away from the ideal of healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes a large amount of flour, meat and sweet meals.
“Specific alarm is a major popularity of sweet cooling drinks,” the final part of the study states.
As a main meal, the pasta beats a bird with a small overweight.
However, the children were practically not interested in beans, fish and vegetable foods.
Aim for a healthy way of life
The study also showed that children were willing to change their eating habits provided that the information was provided to them.
" Many participants of the research control group showed a significant improvement of healthy food preferences when they filled the poll after the Exactness lecture was not a coincidence," the project stated.
This was particularly notable, for example, in the case of sweet cooling drinks, more children prefer them just water.
Furthermore, the main meals were often marked by the bird and fish, limiting the number of sweet meals and bakes.
Stilist should also be a good psychologist, according to professionals
In the first article on style training, I attended information at introductory classes.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
Lessons of three experts in this area; clothing advice for non-standard figures; and seminars on how all this works in real life.
There's more.
The closer we are to the final examination, the more information and practical tasks are waiting for us.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is truly satisfied with information.
This time with Alenka, the director, we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One short neck, another male figure without appropriate forms, weighs more.
The stilist should know how to minimize wide shoulders, prolong the neck or add the missing amounts.
We were given advice to emphasize the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, the owners of more profound breasts and potatoes, and not to wear them too provoking.
For example, if the difference in the size of the talia and the beard is so large that you can't pick up a suit or pants, it is worth having at least one thing to order.
You will obviously not regret the funds invested because the perfectly seated clothes are worthless.
In a suit sewed for order, you will feel much better than the one who keeps moving, wailing, naked, etc.
Male figures, on the other hand, can wear clothing, application, shift or folding.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I am glad that I have a week to realize this.
Still, I'm afraid that's too much, given the homework we got.
Each participant had to come up with two dresses for any celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I'm about to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secret's advertising campaigns.
I am happy for myself, because it's much easier to dress than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Agiler, who has recently recovered from tonne (please, remember that I'm exaggerating), or quite young Selena Gomez.
We must cut out the clothing from magazines or find it online, print and process with graphical programs.
The Mudbord - so called the result of work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphical image.
It is important to keep a graphical style in mind.
The stylist does not just wear real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions, such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what a stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us.
But it was only Sunday.
Stylist needs common knowledge
The Saturday Talk filled with information on figure types was raised by three professional guests in this area.
Stilist, Honza Pokorne; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and stylelist should use this fact.
A good styleist can use one of the clothes differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, the coat-trench can be wearing normally over the jeans and t-shirts like a coat; but it can also be wearing on a naked body, without a traps like a dress.
Another possibility is to wrap the sleeves or lift the collar, and the whole image is completely changing.
"Game with him," he emphasized.
Anyway, I appreciated the following advice: "For your work, you must know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them," said Jacob to us.
This is where I finally realized why we're going to absorb all the definitions and rules that are combined with something and why, while in fashion magazines we often see different things.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that a stylelist should have more options than the number of photos he needs to do.
So for a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten dresses) I must be prepared to create at least 15 images.
Now I also know that the object of clothing on the painting often looks and works in combination with others is not as in reality.
We need to think of this when we create a image.
Honza Pokorne confirmed that the image and style were often half the success.
Just look at Madona, who doesn't have an impressive vocal, but her image and marketing turned her into a world star.
Relationship with styles in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often think that it is too much (and they believe that it is enough to be a specialist in something and how they seem to be secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to call us a different size than the one they really wear.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote anything about the fact that some famousness was thick/familiar, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it was not enough for the stylest to learn in fashion and to be able to pick up a dress.
Our work is mainly of communication with people we dress; therefore it is important to be a good psychologist.
To evaluate people, not to do them or to follow their views.
"If the manager asks you to review her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can't throw out all her closet by telling her that her clothes are horrible."
"Find at least a few things you can commend, and advise you what you can wear with them," said Mario.
He also showed us that the work bag should be specifically incorporated.
This is the bag you tie around the tall to wear everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, sticky rolls or English bars, there should be a neulonic thread (stylists use it in some of the items, such as bags or hat), special tissues for tissue tissues on the back if the clothing is too large (buttons and similar objects are prohibited because they corrupt the clothes) or a sewing set.
In order to distract from the lectures and get some practical experience, we learned to make proper shoes.
Even during the shooting in the studio where the gender is smooth, the injuries can be damaged, not to mention the shooting on the street.
And then we took a sticker.
You don't have to touch your shoes with scissors so you can't ruin them.
This requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
I didn't like the skills I mentioned.
It's only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional styleist is not easy to say anything.
V Need for Speed: Run is happening in America.
Review
What was supposed to be a careless walk, became a routine morning journey to work because of a series of totally inappropriate and negligible errors.
The ambitions have been satisfied to a certain extent, but it is not important, as no one clearly wanted to do extra jobs.
Before exiting the new version with the subheading "Feed", there were great hopes.
It was expected to move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; the demonstration versions indicated that the game would take a decent place in the race genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the chief hero walks out of the car and runs.
As often happens with the NFS, there is a great difference in the way we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression is a few unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for years.
So it's not really mistakes, it's the manifestation of an unexplained lane of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You're part of the history, whose chief hero, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by taking part in an illegal race through America.
You're sitting in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
It has several interesting features.
The route consists of ten phases divided into more than 50 races.
This means that each race goes on its own route, and the different stages go in a variety of interesting environment.
Therefore, there is no sense that the game is always the same.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in the previous series, some routes are enjoyable.
Nevertheless, the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in the autumn suburbs or high in snow mountains, it is very pleasant.
Furthermore, the races sometimes revive an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert you fall into a sandstorm, which is significantly lowering visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful to avoid falling under the lawn.
The individual races are pretty well arranged.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while, you are trying to get some of the rivals, and then you try to improve your time (the standard racing with the second-time) or you compete with one opponent.
Besides all the other things, you have a time-only contact with the police that makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the buttons at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much less than you could expect (only three to be precise).
In fact, it turns out that it is good for the game because it is not boring; given all the above, it is one of the things that make the game more interesting.
The race model is followed by previous models.
This means that she is no longer a special one, but that cannot be considered a deficiency.
If you're looking for a real life imitation, you'll have to find somewhere else.
Nevertheless, this driving model is very good for dynamic races, although better options can be found on the market.
So far, it's very good.
However, some time after that, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the model of collision is not that good.
You don't expect difficult conversions and collisions from this game, but if you have no idea how your car will behave, something is wrong.
Usually, by running or driving past the cars in a dense stream, you sometimes touch another machine, but sometimes in a practically similar situation, your car starts freaking off.
Or it's breaking up.
This is not so important because of the restart system, but it's enough to ruin fun.
The restarts are built so that if you break or go far off the route, the game returns you to the point where it has been interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work, but you can't trust it completely.
Sometimes restarting is not enough, and you have to learn a separate racing area.
The important lack of game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns have to go in a certain way, or you just don't enter.
In other cases, you meet civil vehicles in a certain place in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, five, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
This is particularly irritating in situations when you see your rival drives easily between two vehicles moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you get there, the cars are already located in a way that you either need to round them or drop the speed.
It doesn't matter when you're near them; it's arranged that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of time, the same competitor is chasing you in the same place.
This is especially obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you are going in the opposite direction.
Apparently, your rival must stand before you, despite anything.
The point is, when he comes before you, he's making you worse, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it is so obvious that it begins to be a little irritated.
It is pity because, despite the simple driving model, the game is interesting and sometimes so satisfied with events that you have no time to pay attention to what is happening around you.
No matter what you don't miss, the concept with fifty unique routes, the sequence of race or something.
The idea of car change during the race is unusual.
You need to track the gas stations on the road, because that's what your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports vehicles are suitable for cities; powerful American vehicles are for direct road cuts; and exotic super-sporters for technical ride, for example, on the unavoided mountain routes.
The main mode history regime is closely linked to the mode challenge regime; this is the race on individual parts that you will learn during the game.
Here you win for your personal case both medals and glasses, common for challenges and stories regimes.
Many possibilities are available for a higher level of driving: starting from vehicles and ending with the profile data.
Furthermore, the profile is linked to the Autolog online function, which compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players and provides communication with the public.
Here's another lack of understanding; it's an example of the last race in a sequence.
You and your car are going into a metro tunnel (with you think so), where you run through railways in darkness (be sure it is).
Your spidometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (will we think so), when the train at the back suddenly flies you, turning your car into a metallomb breast.
During a few days, our edition discussed whether, in the course of the game, no one thought a second, or its creators really think of us as such.
The technical composition of the games is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video row is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
Although in some critical moments, the quality of recording is sometimes quite low.
This is particularly about events with a large number of participants, where a good record would not help you.
The sound is fine; the saundrec is on the lover.
In order to satisfy the wider youth audience, in the saundtrack “incorporated compositions of different styles”; but it is unlikely that a lot of people will buy a game because of its music.
General impression of Need for Speed: Run is quite irregular.
If the game had escaped obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Run is the best part of the NFS in the past few years.
However, the game remains incomplete.
Of course, it's a good entertainment, but be prepared that shortcomings will blind you as a lighter of the airport.

EU Ambassador Vicenova:
The Czech Republic has the reputation of displeasant and sceptics in relation to the euro.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused significant differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a cruel war."
"It takes five or six years before the situation is stabilized, calmed down and all players will be used to their new roles," EU Ambassador Milen Vicenova strictly started its лекtion at the Legal Faculty.
It has proved to the extent to which its " Clear and Open About Europe" is held in the first part of its lecture, where it describes individual EU institutions and relations between them so easily and clearly that many lecturers from the Legal Faculty of CU would envious.
Furthermore, Vicenova commended the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"The criticists at the beginning said he was a common grey office mouse that could not play any role; I should say, everyone was amazed how well he managed with his role."
"He is a person who can listen at the same time to the twenty-seven participating countries, who has a good idea of how to develop the EU."
She explained her new post of the representative on international relations and security as an answer to the question, " Who is the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. as an important step to unify and greater transparency of the Union's policy against countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheese
Vicenova has further focused on the programme key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the successful Czech presidency last year.
The Czech Republic dealt with the coming financial crisis; they overcome the crisis and organize the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at the time was a negative phenomenon that caused severe damage to the Czech Republic.
The representatives of Czech Republic are currently very busy in the EU.
As the Ambassador said, the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the continuing nursery.
A new seven-year EU budget must also be adopted, which is very difficult, taking into account the modern crisis.
Whether the budget will be poor and economic, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive greater support and what less; all these issues are in the forthcoming programme.
Ambassador reminded the key sloungs she brought to Brussels: "O Europe, Understanding Tongue."
"I really don't like cutting, foreign words, and the jargon that no one understands.
As citizens can realize that people in Brussels do not try to sell curve or round corn, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our variety of cheese."
It is also going to use the EU environment more effectively and bring more Czechs into European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe - our future
The Ambassador argues that the Czech Republic is considered Euro-sceptics, as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive sides of the matter.
She wished that more representatives of Czech Republic be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are guilty: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters; at the same time, with little Czech support.
In addition to the successful chairmanship of the Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the High City Group.
"Believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak joins us, the French says, "Hey, why is the congregation again, the High City Group?", and he is not happy with it.
In the future of the Union, Vicenov awaits mainly new strict rules for the budget policy of States parties.
In comparison with the new European Federation, it considers the idea two-speed, unless the multi-speed Europe is more realistic.
"We have both countries inside and outside the eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"It was said for the first time that countries who want to be united, whereas those who do not want to stay away."
"The number of such institutions will grow; this will be truly two-speed Europe," Vicenova awaits.
In this regard, she emphasized the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in the promotion of the rules under which all issues relating to all EU should be discussed by all parties, not only in the eurozone.
Brand History:
The innovator of IBM enters the second century of its existence.
If anyone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, it will probably be "every time".
For the public, IBM is a symbol of technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The longitude of the company was placed by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas Watson's senior.
He believed in his deviation that many world problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His Sympathetic Sympathy has thus become a stamp around which the life of the future giant (and the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to issue in 1935).
Furthermore, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson thoroughly built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement to the future.
IBM survived and prospered for hundreds of years because she remained faithful to her original values, although she was not afraid to change everything around her.
In our first 100 years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to reach even more," said current leader of the company Samuel J. Palmizano on the anniversary.
Complicated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of the care of employees, just as Father in the Czech Republic, the IMB staff were one of the first American employees with a payable leave, the insurance of the employer, the elegant uniform and the complex bonus system for best inventors and entrepreneurs.
Such advancements are long-term IBM relationships with consumers.
It was one of the first world-wide companies that eliminated all discrimination, which gave her a great choice.
It agrees with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, in accordance with which the woman, Virginia Rometti, will change Palmizano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently the director of sales, marketing and development.
For the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brain strikes, in which many future innovations arise.
It is not surprising that a lot of ideas is that about a half a million people work in the company.
Organization with a good reputation
The strong position of the company in the business is provided by a strong internal and external image.
"From the first time, in terms of the IBM concept, it was rather an organization than a technology company," the Economist said to the Professor of the Harvard Business School and the author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technological company, it is a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added Jodge Colony from the Forrester Research Consulting Company.
As said in the company itself, there is a difference between going to the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it was called in the United States because of its logo, became one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most universal technological company - the designer of equipment and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnology.
It owns the largest amount of patents among all American technological companies, and five of its staff received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, bankomates, banking maps, financial cotton, code and discet.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, the IBM became the second largest technology company (the first in Apple) for the first time since 1996.
Watch Forward
Not all of its products were tasteful to buyers and entered into the age. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online and PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by moving forward, you cannot be emotionally bound to the past," said Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why the IBM is easily based on several platforms -- if they don't work, it refuses them.
It is, for example, different from its Microsoft competitor, who is based and survives the falls on Windows, its operating system.
Perspective technology
The IBM main income is from services, and approximately one fifth in each case comes from computer programs and equipment.
While in 1990, with capital twice, it was the strongest manufacturer of equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets at $15 billion, while investing 58 billion in prospective technologies.
It continued investment even after 2008, when the world's first hit the current economic crisis.
IBM follows the example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments in the years of great depression.
The IBM seems to have not caused any harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the IBM share price increased by 120 per cent; the net earnings of the company continued to grow.
The IBM corporate deviation is to change everything but its own values.
It is therefore possible to expect that even if a further crisis occurs, this flexible giant will deal with the situation.
IBM history: from cheese knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York 100 years ago. Its original name was "Computation, Tabulation, Records".
It took the name IBM in 1924, which was originally called a brand used for the offices of the company in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were founded by a merge of four companies, whose history begins in the 1880s.
They owned technologies, such as legendary "tabel clocks", i.e. hours fixing the time when staff come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlet Flint, who was also head of the company's council by 1930.
Flint hired a competitive director Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
The manager then moved the founder of IBM into the shadow of Watson's ideas remained a base of incredible corporate culture and individuality.
Watson was head of the company until 1952.
IBM, as clear of the name, began with the production and sale of different business equipment from cheese knives and meat cuts to casso apparatus.
During the first four years of Watson's management, the delivery was doubled to nine million dollars, and the company was exposed to all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that nearly 40 years later, his son, Thomas Watson, took his place in the chair of the director.
Under his leadership, IBM began developing artificial intelligence technologies and created the first language of programming.
In the 1960s, both staff and IBM computers helped NASA to control space flights - to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 - a human flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM line System/360.
The classical PC, which defined the computer standards of that time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
After twenty years, IBM sold the production of computers of the Chinese company Lenovo, while bought the consulting office PricewaterhouseCoopers, focusing fully on consulting and services with high value added.
In the last three years, IBM has made great success with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its goal is a reasonable use of technologies in areas where this has not yet been planned and improved road situation and urban governance.
In the scope of the IBM trade, the Smarter Commerce has recently presented a Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the whole trade cycle.
The IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today IBM CZ is also managed by a Strategic Outsourcing Centre in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe are located in Prague, where the World Level Research Group is also working on the recognition of the speech.
Richtarging about his misbelievable husband:
I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtaržová, 53, said it was over!
After her husband Josef Richtarg, 53, became a bodyguard and lover of Ybeta Bartoshová, Darina was still hoping that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she did not want to wait, and she marked clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," explained Richtaržova.
When Darina Richtarž in summer provided in her house the blood of Bartosh, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And though she forced Yvette to leave Ržican 30 days later, Pepa didn't leave a singer.
Moreover, he publicly confessed that he loved her.
Some time later, Darina gave up, pretending to make her husband's romance, and now she finally said goodbye.
I don't care who his wife's sleeping with.
Even if Richtarg and Bartosh ever break up, his wife won't accept him with a broken armor.
"He's a biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will expel him."
"And he will end his days, not as my loved, lost and found old fool, but the man with whom I have something to do," said Richtaržova, adding that she has already released her husband and insists only on both occasions.
As long as Joseph did not object to his wife’s rejection.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yvette, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife decided to leave her marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union still works; I am responsible for repairing, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I communicate perfectly normally, but we don't share the bed anymore," said Richtarge magazine Blesk.
He claims that if Richtaržova finds a new love, he won't interfere with her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, if she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I'm in full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst women's habits: Do they touch you?
When you ask men to name some typical bad women's habits, they usually list them all immediately.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines that describe a few female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your second half complains that you're walking around the stores all the time?
Do you have to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping on big sales?
If so, your shopping may be a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their shopping passion.
And yet, who of you will refuse to walk around the clothing shops looking for the perfectly seated clothing and sampling it (with different color options) in samples?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it might become a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside...
Eternal Disappointment
"I am too thick?"
"I need to drop at least five pounds -- why don't I start doing gymnastics?"
"You're still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you join a group of women who are obsessed with your appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men are literally allergic to constant complaints to their own appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more such complaints arise, the more women are irritating them.
The most important thing is order and cleanness
It's like an endless story.
Washing glass, dust cleaning, gender washing, washing dust, bath cleaning at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for coming into a clean cafeteria in dirty shoes; children behind dirt in a clean jacket and fingerprints on the window glass in the living room that was so difficult to clear?
If you suffer from this “reluctance ”, try to realize that it is not good to fall into extremes; and that order and cleanness should not be first in your family.
Without prejudice to purity, your relationships and the whole family can be threatened.
The aim of commanding
"Back your underwear into the trash."
"You're going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"The wet towels should not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, it may be very boring.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Gossip
Some women like to talk, insult and intrigue against others.
Women are focused on relations, so they like to discuss who, where, who, and why.
From time to time, each of us must be making rumors.
Let's be honest, that is the nature of all women.
Anyway, there are more serious rumours, women who often talk and despise others, especially in a female workshop, are a great danger to their surroundings.
Effective transfers of Jagra and Voracek helped Philadelphia conquer
During the NHL match on Monday, two efficient transfers of a hockey attacking Yaromir Jagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 in Carolina's ice.
In both cases, Claude Gyru used the experience of a thirty-five-year-old star; he added another transmission and was declared as the best player of the match.
The two efficient match transfers also belonged to the same team with Jagr Yakubu Voracek.
After the Jagr match, he told foreign journalists that he foretold Gira a great evening.
"I told him before the match that he'd put a heat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel such things," explained Jagr, after whom the Gyru was stabbed the goal as soon as the Flyers had given it.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a Czech trail.
The Harrickaines Voracek conquered the shiboj and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who screwed between the circles.
In a second before the first break, Patrick Dwyer reduced the break in numerous advantages, but the second time again led Flyers.
Especially Giru.
After the efficient delivery of Jagra, he slaughtered the third goal; further his hit was converted into the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best League player, but he's surely a three of the best," said Jager, praising his central.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NHL, my team companions were trying to help me, and now it's my turn," added Jagr.
Carolina made the game more dramatic with Tuomo Ruuth and Dwyer's tools, reducing the breakdown to one naked.
Further complications have been prevented by Matt Reed, which has increased the breakdown to two points.
"Pronger did great in our zone."
"He hit the score, I accelerated, and Reed went to the far side."
"I targeted it and was glad that it worked," Croachek described his impression from the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The defender of the Montreal Czech Republic, Jaroslav Špaček, did not finish the game with Buffalo; he left the game during the second period due to the injury of the top of the body.
Together with an experienced defender, Canadians lost their bi-point advantage and lost 2:3 after the series of tools.
Thomas Plecanec was unable to hit during one of their attacks.
More than lost glasses, the home coach was regretted with a large number of injuries in the back series, since the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We only finished the game with one experienced player, others were young people."
"Whatever it is, we can't do anything about it, we just have to accept it," said Jacques Martin.
"The replacement was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the shift from our zone."
"What was our weak side," added P.K.Subban defender
After thirty attacks, the Czech hykeeper Onjay Paul's helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Jets Goals, who interrupted the fiveth series of losses, were killed by five different players.
Dinamics of travel prices since 1989
By 1989, only five public tourist agencies could work in Czechoslovakia: Chadok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
Since travels to the West were strictly limited, tourist agencies of that time were mainly selling tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, the Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Soci, Crime in the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries in the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, which led to significant restrictions on the visits of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that civilians of the Socialist bloc (i.e. and Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually to socialist countries.
If the Czech Slovakia citizen wanted to go to the Soviet Union or Poland, a invitation from that country was needed; otherwise, it was not possible to travel individually.
At that time, tourist agencies offered travel to the West, but they had to either stand in a row all night with a bedroom bag or have "good friends" in the agency.
And that was not all.
The currency permit was required to travel to the West and was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel.
The Czech Slovak currency was not freely converted; without currency, money (west currency) could not be obtained to travel to the West.
The Czech Republic has often conducted their holidays at home, which has led to a large number of houses and summer houses, and this habit remains to this day.
Since 1989, tourism in Czech Republic thus survived this revolution.
While until 1989 the leave to GDR or Bulgaria was a culmination of our travel, the Czech Republic held 4.5 million vacations throughout the world last year.
The great paradox, which we no longer realize, is that until 1989, we could not freely visit the most popular Croatia, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the beginning of 1990, the need for visa in neighbouring countries of Western Europe was cancelled, which has led to a huge wave of short travel mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czech Slovakia could not find a lot of journeys to the West, and everyone wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists had been sleeping in tents in the parks, since their income was not enough for a hotel or a pension at the time.
The typical feature of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring its own food (conservations, salads, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown, and after decades, our tourists can finally buy the west currency freely.
Our life level and average income grew, which led to another important situation in 1997.
Since 1997, the increased demand has allowed tourism agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all developed world countries except the United States, which made our trips even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travels after the revolution took place in 2000, and the great demand led to the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have delivered Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flights from the Czech Republic will be sent to the twelve exotic directions.
At present, about 100,000 Czech countries visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, which symbolizes our development after the revolution, happened in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States renounced the need for a visa for Czech tourists, thus joining the most developed world countries forever.
For the first time in history in 2008, more than half of their vacations spent abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history they spent over 15,000 crowns per person during abroad leave, including their expenditures in the appointment.
General Assembly should be elected by the President, the threat of path returns
There is a risk that Ivan Hashek, head of the Czech football association (FACR), will not be named even after another extraordinary General Assembly to take place in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no consent in the rules of elections.
Without that, the vote will not begin for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Richl, Miroslav Pelt and Thomas Pazlik are eager to lead Czech football.
Hashek left his position in June, and he called on his colleagues to join and find a strong person who would lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, the age of Hasheka reloaded football between the two chambers of associations that cannot choose a single candidate.
It was obvious on 16 September when a new president was to be elected.
The members of the General Assembly had arrived in the National House in Prague, Smiles, since the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only legal representatives or officials to whom the powers have been granted.
The moment has since been partially resolved through the recommendation of the Institute of State and the Law, under which the Mission, based on the powers provided, is not possible.
Conflict on election rules, however, continues.
The Executive Board also did not help much, although it was mainly involved in its congregations, both regular and extraordinary.
The ideas of vote have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do you go to the third round and avoid the pat?
"The argument is whether to follow the standards established or find another model," said one of the Vice-Presidents of FACHR Dushan Freedom, who represents a professional football in the association management.
Based on the model provided for by the Charter, the winner of the 3rd Round was a candidate who received great support from the Chamber from which he was a candidate.
It is alleged that Moravia agrees to compromise to consider the winner of the candidate's elections with the largest number of voters in both chambers.
The Czech Party insists on the condition that the winner, in a total percentage, should collect at least two thirds of the votes.
"Thereby, two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; it would have completely rejected the concept of the two chambers," the Freedom agrees with Moravia's arguments. He said that it would be best not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing standards.
Some of the sudden, Thomas Pazlik agrees with his views, although the rules of elections laid down by the Charter are more than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to go as far as possible by the statute."
"I want to avoid all possible representative nonsense as at the previous General Assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzeń, who is the first candidate; and he contradicted mostly Pelt in his statements.
Pelt remains a optimist.
He believed that the new president would be known in Nimburg; he also hoped that the candidates would be constructively cooperating in the future.
"All emotional broadcasts will be calmed after today's anticipated national assembly at the European Championship."
"The football will be again on a happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate," said the representative of Jablonez. Three candidates have the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Richl's more restrained.
"I hope of an agreement, but the situation is very unequivocable."
"It is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"It may cause another breakdown of the General Assembly."
"I hope the healthy sense will win," said Richl.
Not enough time left to reach the agreement.
Some of the negotiations have been held directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
A supplementary flight, which was to be delivered, in addition to others, of Vice-Presidents of Dalibor Kucher and Richel to Podgoric, did not leave Prague in the morning due to technical failure. They were looking for an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the place of reigrating match.
Finally, the Minister's meeting, which is expected on Wednesday, may be decisive.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobesh, would like the opponents comprising the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
Many are set on the map: government subsidies; football credit; and the planned CSTV General Assembly with a new Czech sport direction after Saska's financial problems.
Patzlik joins the presidential fight because he does not see a suitable candidate
If before an extraordinary general meeting, the chair of footballists Plzeń Tomas Pazlik saw a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements to the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACHR), he would not even claim high posts.
"If I had been a decent candidate, I would have fought for him and not participated in the fight myself."
"But such a man hasn't been found yet," said Patzlik CTK.
The motivation of Pazlika to combat Miroslav Peltha and Jindrich Richl is to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favourite of elections, from entering the FACHR management.
Furthermore, Pazlik emphasizes that, in the case of victory, he will remain president only until 2013, when another general congregation is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be an experienced top manager, not too connected to football life.
"I spoke to several people that could be thought."
"For me, it was terrible to hear some of them say they don't even want to have a relationship with Czech football at the moment."
"I would like to change that opinion," he said.
The main disagreement of Pazlic with Peltha is now linked to the relationships of the last with Roman Berbro, the President of the Regional Football Association in Plzen. Berbr is a contradictive person, known as an influenced lobbist, who can influence the votes of the delegates of the universal congregation.
Pazlik therefore considers it unacceptable that Peltha become a president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and no football will move forward."
"With the support of Berbra, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful for football," said Pazlik.
He pointed out that a few years ago the name of Pelt was recorded during the phone hearing during the investigation of the corruption case; Pelt was able to avoid the sentence.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring football."
"And how we would look in the eyes of UFA and FIFA," said Pazlik, "he now does not mention his previous statement that he would "sell the Plseń Club if Peltha became president."
If Pazlick wins on Thursday, he could present cooperation with Pelt in the future.
This view is divided by another candidate, Richl, whom Pazlik supported before the universal meeting in September, ended by fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would have approached."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce him to the head of the gathering."
"But he can't manage the association."
"I don't get my nose into what I don't understand," said Pazlik, who drew great attention to himself in September, when he supported the removal of the Judicial brigade headed by human Macella, which was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Pazlik claims he'll risk management of the association.
He refers to his experience in the management of private companies; since last summer, he had managed the Plseń team, which celebrated its first triumph in the League in May.
"I have the strength to make football environment change, to support its changes to better."
"Strict the impact of some groups of persons who are inclined to influence the disciplinary and appealing council, which leads to disgusting situations," said Pazlik.
One of its priorities would be the strengthening of the relationship between FACHR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the assistance of which it will lobby at the highest political level, to provide more money for sports from loteria.
"This is one of the key moments to be taken by the new president."
"If taxes bet gambling, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go," he said.
Patzlik does not consider his relationship with the Plseń Club a burden, although he claims that the FACHR President should be independent.
Peltha is connected to the Jablonian, and Reichl is in Prague Docla.
"It's not a perfect option."
"I still don't see any sense in the hypocrisy transfer of my shares of the Club Plizen to someone else, since I'm going to go back in six months," said Pazlik.
Pelt promised new FACHR rules that would avoid the Election Pat
Two days before the general soccer association, one candidate to the President, Miroslav Pelt, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for the new FACHR rules to avoid disputes on the election rules in the future.
Before negotiations on Thursday in Nimburg, the official of Jablonez remains optimistic and believes that attention from the pre-electoral fight will be sensitively distracted by today's expected success in our soccer collection.
Before the elections in September, Pelt promised that if he wins, he would focus on both the mission and the receipt of funds.
He decided to participate in the elections at the last moment before the last General Assembly, and the two-month delay could therefore be useful for him to stand up with his ideas of football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have long been in football, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
“They feel that it is time for someone to head the association,” said a person mainly related to the Jablonec club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems were caused by the euforya that was ruled by Ivan Hashek.
" Unfortunately, the rules that were not so perfect as we all thought were adopted in the general meeting in June."
"If no different ways of representation were accepted, we would have had a president since September," said Pelta.
It referred to the transmission of the key document of the civil association as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become a president, I will consider it my personal task, and I will take personal responsibility if this attempt is unsuccessful."
"It is a fundamental issue without which we cannot exist," said Pelta.
Besides, he says he doesn't try to identify himself in the background of the rivals.
In the past, he had already stated that he could present his cooperation with Jindrich Richl, who he appreciated for legal education; he was fully aware of the fact that his candidate should become his first vice-president.
For a long time, he hasn't attacked Thomas Patzlic, who has constantly criticized Pelt.
"He's been in football over a year and has made a certain success."
"No matter what, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people surprised the methods of his pre-electoral campaign."
"So some of them are now questioning his true personality," Pelt said about his competitor. "Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations that he declared in September.
He views his main weapons as the knowledge of football, from competing at the lowest level to the national gathering.
The national assembly should represent the whole football.
"I would also try to stop all the incidents, starting with the Czechs or the consequences of the last year's corruption scandal."
"I would immediately focus on the negotiations with both private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football," said the 40-year-old candidate of CTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to a football head would not relieve staff releases.
"I will need to know the official instructions of individual staff." It was his letter to the insurance, where the period of intergovernmentality was a clear nerve.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios, he believes that the delegates will come to Nimburg on Thursday.
"If the only question is how to make elections in the third round, we can deal with it."
"The football needs the trust he can only obtain by finally choosing his leader," said Pelt, who two days before the key day of his career, remains optimistic.
Richl promises that FACHR will start working actively with its leadership.
If the Thursday meeting of Jindrich Richl, the Vice-President, becomes the President of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association will be desperate.
Richl promises that if he is elected, the time of hard work will come.
He wished to make changes in the system and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual fields of football.
He also promised to solve the problem of the Czechs; to improve relations with UEFA and with FIFA; to bring more money to football; and to continue the work of the former President Ivan Hashek.
"As President, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"Of international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national collection, professional football and youth football activities."
"I don't want to say that I will do it myself," said Richl in his interview with CTK.
"I am a team player, and I want to allocate powers in the Executive Committee so that each member focuses on a particular area."
"I'm carefully distributing the tasks so that each of these football segments will make great steps forward."
"It will probably not be liked by many people because it would mean hard work, rather than just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in football movement must have caused him to doubt his candidacy.
"Because I know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there is any sense in this, and that I will not be surrounded by people who put sticks in my wheels and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
"Nonetheless, many people told me that I should not give up, otherwise others will come."
"This is the trust I can't abandon," he said.
Furthermore, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Hashek.
"The larger number of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to re-incorrect all of this."
"The processes have been initiated that can result in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelt, will be elected, the situation in the Association can be returned to what was before Hashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that is not the competence of Mirek Pelt."
"He is surrounded by people who would take football so that he could only be accessible to the elected."
"I can be accused of a lot, but certainly not of subjectivity."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority," said Richl.
Furthermore, he opposes accusations that he will be only President of Czech Republic.
"Although many people are trying to claim the opposite, I plan to make the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the division of the second League into the Czech and Moral parts whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"It will prevent the current situation when only three Moravian teams are in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Richl.
While the leader of the Plseń Tomas Pazlik was joined in the presidential struggle, Raichl did not dare to assess his chances for victory.
"I still feel strongly supported in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen my Vice-President, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," Richel said. He has made its success to save dozens of millions of crowns on uncomfortable contracts, negotiations on TV contracts and negotiations on the Lottery Law.
On the other hand, he is partly blaming himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Confirming that Pelt was “excluded from the process of returning credit to Czech football”, he considered another rival, Patzlika, a strong candidate who had to offer.
"No one can doubt that he worked well in Plzen this year."
"If it is chosen, I hope that he will continue what Ivan Gaschek began without substantial staff changes in the committees."
"He would not distort the facts for his benefit," said Richel about his rival.
The most beautiful pools of Europe
Jump to Water
Julia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fibre optics and status pools in Budapest. Travelers can try the unbelievable water of Europe - and relax the tired body in a jacuzzi after a city excursion or walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meader couldn't take care of during her research trips for the last year and a half: without her bathing suit.
Laying on her back in the water, she looked up with a taste made by the dome, flying to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the end of the pool and loved the closely restored swimming pools like a-nauto.
She hurried to add every loved pool to her book - with important details about the construction and history of the building.
The historian of the architecture of Meder examined more than 200 swimming pools -- and now gathered the impressions in its recently published book Badefreuden (Badefreuden), where everything came from public pools in München to the historic swimming palaces in the Black Forest and the "functional concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited Bathrooms in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of bath culture.
She has very little enthusiasm on sports, said Meder, but in the water, everything is different.
The only deficiency is that the swimming fans should be treated with the blue café tile and the smell of chlorine, while the runnings can breathe with a lustful smell of wave forests or listen to the joyful squirrel of birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why the swimming pools should always be so horrible," said the Vienna Meder.
"So I started gathering beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The flashing in the pool and excellent butter in the sauna is so significant in the bathrooms because, according to Meder, all feelings are stimulated.
And the swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if the buildings take such work. "Instead of the sex in the pool, you have the surface of water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All reflects: high ceilings, colored tiles and tramplins.
The illustrated edition of Bath joys on 190 pages contains valuable information on the architecture and cultural history of health oasis - and causes you to want to jump into water.
Meder's collector found several extraordinary copies during the study in Hungary.
It discovered a rich water in the cave of carshole (Miškolz-Tapolce cave) and a term bath filled with pumping water in a building built in a bottle (Varosi Termalfürdö, Isberna), as well as a wonderful therapeutic bathroom, such as 100-year-old Bath of the Seceni in Budapest.
Of many heated open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is an excellent view. You can see the whole Zurich from the bathroom on the roof or consider the snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anthon.
Perhaps the most unusual design is expecting bathers in Langgenfeld, and the Aqua Course in Ectal looks like the UFO just landed in the Alps.
The winter is raised by a couple of three open crabs, which seemed quite small in the background of the Ectal Mountains.
Algambra, Swartzwald
The collaborator of pools was not in every pool that had a scent of chlorine.
Many thermal baths smell gray. The Arpad Bathrooms in Bekashthab smell so much in oil that you might be difficult to believe that you're in a healing source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbons in the pumping water, and the water is almost black from an ila that sticks to the skin as soon as you flood into a pool - a curable experience of a certain type.
However, at some point, Iris Meder was disappointed in looking for its beautiful bathing sites. When she tried to visit the open Czech bathroom bath in Lugachovic, she discovered that the territory was printed.
Bathrooms designed by architect Dushan Yurkovich in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked into the visible windows of the red-white-yellow building in the style of a-nauto, she saw the turkeys growing between cave tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by hot tracks is the amazing swimming pool in Swartzwald, the Palace of thermal Waters in Bud Wildbad.
The basins have already been through three stages of construction, and you will find not only the Neo-Romanian elements of the period after the construction of 1844 but also the Mauritanian Hall in Al-Al-Al-Al-Al-Al-Al-Al-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Termal Palace, the favorite swimming pool of Iris Meader, and not only because it was from Schwarzwald.
"It is a real achievement to combine such different architecture styles," said Meder.
Thermal pool in such a palace is obviously a secondary class.
Speculation of agricultural products
Doyche Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tives
Will Doyche Bank stop tradeing in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Ackermann had given the working group an assignment to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor worldwide.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Gamburg -
According to one study, 84 percent of the Germans are considered unacceptable that banks speculate for agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two thirds of the bank and other banks are required to stop trade in agricultural products, as trade is aggravating the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
Conclusions were made in a study conducted by the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa from Foodwatch.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Schuman, demonstrates that the world trade rates are increasing prices - and the banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The campaign of consumer defenders was directed directly against the head of the Doyche Bank of Josef Akkermann, although large banking houses, such as Godman Sax and Morgan Stanley, are also traded.
The sales rates were originally contemplated as a means of protecting traders from price hesitation.
However, most experts now agree that the players have refused the rules of proposal and demand - and are profited from the poorest.
In contrast to competitors in the United States, Akermann responded to the criticism and promised to investigate the charges and said that no trade "is worth risking a good reputation of Doyche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the charges contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of the Doyche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the Bank then plans to announce the changes followed by the investigation at the end of January.
Trafficking in goods may decrease or end completely.
Ackermann's working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode rejoiced the news, emphasizing his critical attitude to the financial sector. "Foodwatch rates are an exciting example of how banks are currently acting against common interests."
As the main lobbyist of the bank, Ackermann has a certain responsibility, in the opinion of Bode.
"Doyche Bank must remove all investments that make money at food prices," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter whether it is a hungry person or a reputation of Doyche Bank."
The rapid response of Ackermann was surprised at first, but the Director would like to have an immigrant image just a few months before his office was completed.
The Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman would not enter the Observation Board as planned.
Abolition of speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He should also not be concerned about expenses, with the consequences of the successor.
Each second would renounce investments in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users joined the organization's campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, which was conducted for the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 have participated.
Not more than eleven per cent believe that the investments that make the price of food are acceptable for the Doyche Bank.
Many bankers would also take concrete steps if they discovered that their bank was involved in such trade.
43 per cent would be recommended to leave the bank, 49 per cent said they would consider closing the account and transferring to another bank.
Home of the 21st century in Vienna
Pavilion in a new place
Ingeborg Vincevski
The architectural history with airlines, falls and happy ends. The Pavilion of Austria for the World Exhibition of 1958 in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, deserted and abandoned.
Now it's opened again as an exhibition center.
The Pavilion of Austria, designed by Carl Schwancer for the World Exhibition of 1958 in Brussels, is a well-known example of the modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, which expressed faith in technical progress.
Pavilion Schvancera conquered Grand Pri in the architecture in 1958 for his light steel and glass structure.
The building is considered to be an architecture in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built a pavilion of Austria at the next World Exhibition.
Finally, he was celebrated throughout the world in 1973 by his legendary four-cylinder tower of BMW and its sister, a building in the form of a cup.
The Pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Switzerland Garden near the Southern Vienna District, converted and opened as the 20th Century Museum in 1962, and often referred to as “Home of the 20th century” for that reason.
However, the building was not suitable for the technical and spatial museum -- there were no walls on which art works could be hanged, and bad air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until contemporary art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition has become worse and worse.
The architect Adolph Krishanitz has now restored a pavilion called “Home of the 21st century” and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is the Museum of Belveder, which opens the first exhibition on Tuesday night, in all senses, a joyful event.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belveder Gallery in 2007, has contributed to a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate of the Art History Faculty of Brilliant Career, who worked in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, convinced politicians and guards to continue reconstruction, attracted public resources and private donations and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum had to contain a permanent exposition of the FRIC WATRUSA FRIC, the coffee and the book store along with modern art, and a office building was also to be built.
Strict control & limited budget
The Crichanist was then a perfect candidacy for the project.
He was known, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession, Josef Olbrich, and won a competition, but he also learned from Swancer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was “exclusively important place” for him, where he visited the exhibition of the exhibition of the " start every week".
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that were before the building, a building that had already lost part of its size and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and transformed.
The problem that occurred at the last restructuring was much more serious.
The window profiles on the glass fasade were replaced, a strong glass-wailed safe glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-sistage safe glass.
The steel heat bridge translations were strengthened or replaced, and the asbest was removed from the ceilings.
Two lower floors created a space for the new use of the building, the lighting well between the building and the street provides lighting - almost a new building, but still excellent Swancer pavilion.
The original external doors were stored, and the building was decorated in the old red brown color of protection against corrosion.
The movie hall was the same as it used to be.
All of this with strict museum management control and limited budget.
"We have often had to find a good, cheap material and be approved by the museum management," Cryshanites said, pointing to the inequality in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light, despite limitations, problems and conversions.
Crichanist noticed recently that the pavilion "from Brussels" was a rough, typical history of "Capli in the city".
Such an architecture "not always in its place" still wishes to stimulate real awareness.
The home of the 21st century is in a very proper place, because the unexpected luck occurred in the planning of the city. The entire reconstructed “the main station” with offices and housing property is growing around the Swiss garden.
The home of the 21st century may be supplemented by the second building of the Crishanites, a Collectioner of Francesca von Gabsburg, acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and, as reportedly, negotiations with the city on its neighbourhood in the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a million winter anticrisis package
Deutsche Bahn announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid winter train cancellation.
The number of staff should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Recalling the internal anticrisy plan Deutsche Bahn, the Bild newspaper reported that up to 2015 investments were planned to be around 300 million euros.
Investments are intended to improve labour capacities for locomotives and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and attracted staff involved in the cleaning of snow with roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms up to the start of work and 90 per cent of the necessary arrows within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned about the possibility of the cancellation and delays of trains by that winter at the meeting with Government leaders and industry two months ago.
During the last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger transport, as she lacked reserves at the time of weather deterioration.
A number of new regional trains have been expected to endorse the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn has also had been much more frequently checked on ICE train axes after one of the ICE trains broke right at the main station in Kelne.
Doyche Bank will pay millions of fines in the United States
New distress came from the turbulence of Josef Ackermann, Director-General of the Doyche Bank: Doyche Bank is threatening a fine in the United States in many millions of pounds of sterlings.
As if Doyche Bank had little problems in the family, the past of the industrial giant in the United States has now imposed him, and the Bank with the headquarters in Frankfurt will pay $145 million (106 million euros) to calm down the disputes that occurred after bankruptcy during the financial crisis of five largest credit unions.
The problem was to sell mortgage bonds.
The National Administration of Credit Unions (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of largest banks that they used false promises to force credit unions to buy their financial products by fraud.
The cost of bonds has fallen sharply during the financial crisis and has brought down credit unions.
"We are glad that we have solved this problem without the court," said the representative of the Doyche Bank in New York.
The Bank did not accept its guilt in the agreement.
The same is true for Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President of NCUA, Debbie Matz, welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Loan Management (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and interferes with bankruptcy in order to protect consumer contributions.
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for the losses of billions.
This is the first agreement of this kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and in summer excited the case against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Suspicious mortgage liabilities are so-called valuable papers provided by a bullet of mortgage loans.
They are supported by internal loans.
This resolved the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble in the real estate market in the United States in 2007.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long time to live in September 2008 at the bank of the financial crisis.
A few years later, the U.S. banks are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have raised a large amount of claims in order to pay compensation or punish fraud.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) is behind the largest wave claims.
It accuses 18 biggest international banks that they acquired Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit agreements for approximately $200 billion.
The Bank also faces the threat of the prosecution by the FHFA on numerous agreements of the total cost of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that the Frankfurt headquarters bank take responsibility for " significant losses " but not yet indicate the exact amount.
The Bank rejected claims as unfounded and reported its intention to dispute them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM
The Buffet Financial Guru is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he bought shares for more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the largest American investor Warren Buffet has always stated that he does not invest in computers and IT companies, as their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed its view of investment in this sector.
According to Baffet, he had to understand much earlier that IBM first offers services and buys computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, the investments of Warren Buffet had been considered a knightship.
IBM, the IT-speed veteran, has now received the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the U.S. Business Television CNBC Baffet reported that he had acquired IBM shares for a total of $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffet said that even IBM had known nothing about his involvement until recently.
He commended the management that managed to make profits even during the financial crisis.
"They have done great work," said Buffet, considering the management strategy.
The IBM had a considerable time focused on high-income IT services such as the centre dates.
The founder of the computer industry, who is now over 100 years old, also offers software and advisory services, as well as powerful business computers.
Buffet has still avoided technological companies.
He claimed that he was investing only in those companies whose business he understood
Invested, for example, in cargo carriages, fabric materials and machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns parts in a long list of largest companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (ex Münchener Rück), together with about 80 its own daughter companies.
The 81-year-old acquired a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the most expensive companies in the world with skilled investments.
His lifestyle, however, remained modest,
making it a cultual figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unfair instinct in making money brought him a nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
The IBM share price increased by one per cent until the market was opened after the Buffet investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as they call IBM, is at the fund market of over $220 billion, which makes it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
But Buffet said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
Unlimited Danger
Following the discovery of the "Cwickau" Turkish media began to question the rule of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers says "Blood Ideology", which is now rising up to the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessmen between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a real extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have become a response to this communication in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long-forgotten fears, and such law-extremist attacks have not been in Melan since in November 1992 and Zollingen in May 1993.
There has never been doubts, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the detected law-extremist network has a scale that is not fully aware of.
"Regeneration of bloody ideology?" was the title of the website of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be involved in the right-extremist mud.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded quietly, mentioning victims of racial hatred by silent picket against the Brandenburg Gate on this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish Berlin community at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians noted the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkey bilateral employment agreement.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light -- as a history of success.
The lighting in some Turkish media was a shock. " The present from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the name of one article in the Turkish Haber X Internet portal, commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German Hürriyet also did not miss this parallel.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Khulahji.
He noted that people who paid taxes and their work had contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany were killed.
Police behaviour and subsequent successful robbery were criticized by German-Turkey internet forums.
The authors asked why the German authorities did not think before to monitor suspicious persons in the right-extremist circles.
Some authors have come to a rather sharp rhetoric. "If they continue to act the same way, migrants will have no choice but armed self-defence."
"It'll be the best self-defense."
"The peace in Germany is very much dependent on how the whole network will be opened and on the rightfulness of punishment," says Selen.
The crimes in Melna and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example that the world in Germany was threatened.
The photograph of burned ruins in Zollingen was deeply seized in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks living here so clearly that they are in danger, and the Germans -- that improperity and indifference can be incurred into real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of Turkish unity.
Do not repeat past errors
During that period, the Turkish press condemned primarily the failure of the German police after attacks. Helmut Kol refused to visit survivors in Melna.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the burns in Zollingen, but the participation in the memorial ceremony in Kelna adopted by his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Klaus Kinkel Kinkel, in his speech, calculated the taxes paid by Turks in Germany,
It was like he defined the value of a person with the taxes he pays.
The current lighting in Turkish media has reinstated how many German Turks have been deepened since then.
It clearly showed what to be done now, except the efforts to identify and re-evaluate law-extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal on the Zurich Lake
Most European banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS has almost bankruptted during the financial crisis and has been fighting with one, another crisis since then.
Now the German must return him to the faithful course.
Alex Webber probably didn't think he was going to play that role.
In July, after his effective departure from the head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 it would begin at least an effective post, the President of the Board of Directors of the Greatest Swiss Bank of UBS; the unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Webber was apparently excited, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for re-evolved strength and made several friendly observations to his future colleagues.
"UBS has changed to better."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Philliger and Oswald Grubel."
But in September, it became clear that things would be different.
UBS Traider in London circulated bank security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Executive Director Oswald Grubel, banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the head of the UBS Board of Directors is considered sick, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Webber finally become his position?
Weber should consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, it will take the position of the President of the Council in May, not in 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Webber.
He is an economist and specialist in the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and it will certainly need time to adapt.
He suddenly was responsible for the bank's strategy, which once again proved that he deserved the name of the "weakest bank scandal in Europe".
The UBS, on the one hand, was very large until recently managed by the greatest assets in the world, and with the other years, did not come out of scandals.
It seems that a proud Swiss bank has nothing to spare.
It all began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The Bank connected the image of a secret and sustainable but, at the same time, a fancy asset manager with ambitious goals and aims to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, UBS managed 1.6 billion in 2007, thus having more money in management than any other bank in the world,
And as an investment bank, the biggest banks of the world were in the league.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and a banking professor who was a long teacher at the Institute of Banking Affairs at the University of Zurich, explains: "I have always brought UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"When we know what we know now, you can ask how I could have been wrong."
He was really wrong.
Only in 2007, it was clear that something was wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, the executive director Peter Wuffley, who was considered an excellent intellectual and a brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we could guess why he left.
The Bank's Investment Division tried to play on substantial securities and had to write billions.
Believe me, you don't want to, but UBS reported an increase in capital by 13 billion Swiss francs to resist the crisis.
The Bank was really able to find investors -- but investors, from whom many bankers would have recently denied courtily, -- one very transparent Asian sovereign Fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign Fund that was so hidden that even its name had not been reported.
It was just the first hit.
In April 2008, everything has become much worse.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, was resigned in 2006 by the President of the Board of Directors.
In October 2008, there was a disaster, and because of the lack of investment during the UBS financial crisis, the State had to save it.
The National Bank bought UBS toxic securities for unnamed billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a converted bond with a mandatory conversion to become a bank owner.
All Switzerland was in shock: the country realized the dramatic consequences of large banks in the small country.
Finally, the UBS balance in 2007 was five times higher than all Switzerland production (see schedule).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," said a bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster came shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS was capitulating in a tax dispute with the United States and said that he was willing to transmit the data of the rich clients that might have quit taxes through the bank.
UBS has also agreed to pay $780 million for reimbursement of unfounded business income plus fines.
Thus, UBS recognized more or less that it was a tax removal tool.
At the same time, UBS lost what was always his advantage in fighting for rich clients, the secret curtain.
After that scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The expiry of the client's money began.
In a few months, the Bank lost confidence in both main areas of its activities, in investments due to failure speculation and in the management of assets as a result of assistance and promotion of tax removal.
And it just calmed down, and it seemed that UBS had been able to break the situation, as it happened with the trader's affair, and a single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
One thing is, risk management in the investment office is still not working.
"Incident from Adboli clearly showed that risk control has changed insufficiently," said Martin Jansen, professor of economic and finance at the Swiss Institute for the Banking Affairs of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also doubts: "The problem of UBS is that he has no risk control tool."
For a long time, the Swiss bankers have been guardians of the largest assets of the world, not the excessive risk, but the security for money, regardless of whether or not the world has fallen outside the Alpine Republic.
Swiss banks safes have become a symbol of unfair reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize a delicate chocolate taste.
UBS headquarters in Zurich are still in line with the image of a decent Swiss private bank, only a little more.
Her mood is just a classic.
The bank's main office is in Zurich in Banchofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Lake, in the surroundings of the Swiss mountains snow caps.
Buildings are excellent, and the rental rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores such as Confiserie Sprüngli, there are jewelry companies like Tiffany's.
Swiss banks were located here for hundreds of years -- from the National Bank to the Palace of Credi Suiss and the elite private banks, such as Julius Ber.
The heavy door leads to UBS.
Within the walls covered by the marbles, there are large skin couches, next to the emblem of the bank, the big Seif indication.
UBS knows his clients need reliability.
But both largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point dismissed the Swiss banking concepts - or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks believed, have betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the newspaper, like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperated with two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large, in particular in the investment banking, where the Englishsacks are very active.
In his opinion, Swiss people have nothing to add here.
"And if there's anything, they've been adapted to the English Saxon customs long ago."
Indeed, the English Saxon investment banking changed UBS, brought him the first large profits -- and then fiasco; no other European financial institution lost the amount of money in the jungle of substantial assets, such as the largest Swiss bank.
The catastrophe became obvious on 15 October 2008.
"To that Wednesday, the small country coalition with the population of seven million people took the biggest rescue operation in the country's history," wrote Lucas Hessig in his UBS Crazy book.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (approximately 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it come to that?
If Swiss banks ask, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the largest Swiss banks joined one large group in June 1998.
The bank has been educated, which has already been too large for small Switzerland, and the bank that continued to grow.
It also helped that two UBS banks complemented each other, one was a rich, but gradual bank specialized in Zurich for assets management; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
International investment bankers were suddenly accessed to a large amount of money they could use to rotate all-powered wheels.
The two names are related to UBS growth: Peter Wolffley, Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolfly and Ospell were a dream team," said the bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulfley, an excellent intellectual, modest and deeply understood models and statistics, and Ospel with his internal instinct, which went all the way up, starting from the intern at the bank."
But Ospell finally relied on Wolffley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were reality," said Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Honour prevails in defeat.
UBS employees are well remembering the meetings of the members of the government, where Wolfly always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he led the tournament table where the banks had success.
UBS wanted to reach the top of the table.
He was able to do a part of this path.
UBS was the biggest player in the trade of currency and public valuable papers.
UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failures in American mortgage products.
In order to shut up the hole, UBS was involved in an adventure that almost cost him a lifetime.
In pursuit of growth, the bank and the hedge-fund itself have invested in US substantial securities.
This has developed into a large mechanism that combined valuable papers based on US mortgage loans and continued to sell them -- and risked themselves.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way to get out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought until summer 2007, when the American real estate market was already in fire," said the bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One managing officer had to go away after attempts to order the bank had been more difficult than it had seemed at first.
UBS posts have become child-based chairs games and remain unreliable until now.
It is almost impossible for anyone who leads this huge bank.
He must find a strategy for the bank that turns back to all existing business models.
Gaiger's bank analyst has already had an idea to quit investment banking, focus on assets management and forget its Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go this far.
However, it is clear that investment activities must be substantial.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present its future strategy on Tuesday.
51-year Italian-Swiss banker was in fact considered only a temporary decision when the bank unexpectedly quit with his precedent Grubel.
For the past time, he was able to show the nature and now, as the Turich bank said on Turish on Tuesday, UBS heads on a permanent basis.
Ernotti planned to restore the investment bank to the state in which it was in the mid-90s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions must be asked to Axel Webber.
He still publicly said that he and his wife were looking for a place in Zurich.

Recession concerns in Europe bring down the American Fundamental Bureau
The coming recession in Europe has deteriorated the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of Governments in Athens and Rome had no great effect.
The decline of industrial production on the continent has choked the hope that the debt crisis can be overcome in the fertility.
The general relief followed by the change of Governments in Rome and Athens has not been reinforced.
The euro fell in relation to the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass were still considered half full and not half empty -- but now the problems are again ongoing, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
The financial markets, in particular, were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index was closed at 12.078.
The market barometer declined between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader S&P 500 has closed at the level of 1251, falling by one per cent.
The Nasdaq Technological Index lost 0.8 per cent by trade at 2657 points.
In Frankfurt Dax, it fell by 1.2 per cent, closing at 5985 points.
Industries in the euro area in 17 countries have significantly reduced production and are adapted to the end of growth.
The Eurostat Statistical Service reported that companies produced two per cent less than the previous month in September.
This message scraped American investors into sceptsis. "We're not on the island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman from Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe could not quickly strike the recession and that banks show further signs of weakness.
The Legendary Investor Warren Buffett could only confirm these concerns. In the CNBC interview, he said that it was still unbelievable whether Europe was strong enough to do whatever it needed to end the crisis.
He therefore believed that it was too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Baffet threw a trash of a long-term principle and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM amounted to more than ten billion dollars during the trade price of the oldest company's shares almost one per cent against the trend.
The shares closed at the level of $187,35.
Buffet said he paid an average of $170 for the share and now shared 5.5 per cent.
The price of his investment company Berkshire Hathway has fallen by 1.3 per cent.
The Bank of America has fallen by 2.6 per cent, much stronger than the market.
The bank has converted almost the remaining share of the China Building Bank in cash, earning $6.6 billion.
The Bank is mainly planning to support its capital quota of net profit from sale in order to conform to stricter standards.
Boing's aircraft producer won by reducing Dow-Jones loss.
The share price increased by 1,5 per cent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.

Intelligent crows fill the cities
The experts today say that these very clever birds will no longer be able to expel from towns.
Some love birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and the crows have been part of the city landscape for centuries, but the inhabitants complaining about dirt and noise in many inhabitants are increasingly increasing.
However, the bird's problem has not been resolved far.
At the first symposium devoted to the crows, in the city of Ler, Eastern Frissia, experts argued that the player could not be expelled from the cities.
Specialists from all over Germany discussed possible decisions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservationists argued that the root of the problem in cities was in the migration of specially protected players, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture had increasingly destroyed traditional agriculture.
The hunting, expanding construction and cutting of traditional trees complicated birds' lives.
The crows are under guard.
There are large colonies of over 600 parents in the town of Zest in Westfall and north-west in Yever, Dipholce, Ahima under Bremen and Lere.
The unequivocal project for the shooting of crows in Lere called for disapproved paper titles in 2005.
The critics described the catching of birds in traps and slapping them with sticks as a special cruelty.
The architect and landscape designer Werner Claver from Lero said, "The usual movement and scaring is nothing."
The ripping of the nest of streams of water or trees often has undesirable consequences, said Manfred Kaiser from Lar, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"Livings are diversified, and large colonies are divided and distributed into other areas."
Fear can only be exempted from hospitals, houses of elderly and schools.
"We're gonna have to live with them, not to get rid of them."
The problem in cities will not be solved in the gateway, said Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
The combination of the frightening of birds in need of protection and incentives to return to other areas could be an exit.
"Information stends instead of benzopile" was a slogan offered by the psychologist and ethnologist, Maria Jurgens, who has a completely different approach to birds. " We must be sure of ourselves to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational crown route in Asherberg in Slezwig-Holstein, where information was given information on the life of very sensitive players.
The project is already involving tourists.
Yurgens also expressed its opinion on the noises made by the birds. "They have a lot to tell each other. "
The games often use not only the weapons to capture the visual piece but also make the weapons themselves.
Students of conduct at the Cambridge University recently tested the bird mind measure at four players.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that it was necessary to knock on the board to get a liquor of prayer.
Without special training, they recognized the size and shape of the stone needed to pinch the rain.
In another experiment, a more complicated challenge had to be resolved by the intelligent players.
The researchers put a small vocabulary with a liquor in the vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get a snack.
But the researchers gave them pieces of provokes.
All four birds used the cord to make hooks and use hooks to trap the lead for the pen and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have done this since the first attempt.
Ronalda is launching Portugal to Euro-2012
The hope of the Bosnians and Turks to win in the last minute has not been lasted for a long time.

Yiraček cares about Czech Republic
Subsequently, Judge Wolfgang Stork of Ergolding was at the centre of attention.
Following the attack on Elder Post in the Bosnian penalty at the 36th minute, Stork decided that the Portuguese player simulated and showed him a yellow card.
Stork also condemned doubtful tools for the game after Fabiu Quentran - Misimovic implemented it.
Following the 2004 vice championship, four more goals have been established.
Peter Yiraček dissuased all the remaining doubts about the Czechs for the 81st minute.
The European Championships of 1976 were sent to the European Championship five times in a sequence.
Happiness was also smiled to the Coach Michal Bilek and Legionists of Bundesliga, Michael Cadletz (Bayer Levercuzen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FC Nürnberg) after the error at the beginning, which could be a catastrophic.

The winning goal was stabbed just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, was lacking football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after the loss of 0:3 in Istanbul, Turks were unable to play better than the destruction of 0:0 in Zagreb.
Although there is no doubt now that the Coach of Gus Hiddink will now release the place on the chamber of the team to the third place in 2002, Croatia is fourth in the final tour of the European championship.
The Turks were almost perfectly launched in the eyes of 31,000 viewers at the Maximir Stadium.
Seljuk Ian had a seventh-minute stroke, and the attacker Casim Kazim was unable to put the ball into the net.
After that, Croatia woke up and became increasingly involved in the control of the game.
After the break, the Croatians continued the game in a great form.
Legionists of Bundesligi Daniel Pranich (Bavaria, München) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintraht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukich from the Wolfsburg team, who departed Ivan Perishic from Dortmund for 62 minutes.
Trapattoni is on Euro-2012.
The Irish people in Dublin celebrated their first entrance to the Euro after Germany in 1988.

Constantine Basilev compared the account for the 57th minute of the guest team.
Ireland took a good pace from the beginning, but only for the 23th minute, Robbie Keen in Los Angeles made the first clean goal blow.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender was able to prevent it from leading Ireland forward.

Mass murders - human dimension
The tense and very good new book of Peter Englund, "Beauty and grief: Personal History of the First World War" begins with a long list of acting persons whose heart is freezing from.
Here is the advice to read: Carefully cut the page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very closely as Mr. Englund's story, and this list of acting persons will be your GPS, your lightlight at times when you, like one of these men and women, get off the road and lose in the mist of war.
Mr. Engund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it quite exactly as an anti-history work.
There are few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, fancy journalists or tactics and war technologies.
It's not that much of the book about what it was, he explains, how many "books about what it looked like," it's about " feelings, impressions, experiences and spirit status."
The book “Beauty and Tribulation” combined the experience of the military ages of 20 or less unacceptable men and women, from both sides of the front line, from school girls and scientists to alpineists, doctors, ambulance drivers and servants.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone gets captured, loses his hand or leg, gets mad or dies.
Their lives are flourishing here as church candles: new ones are added to the crowd of others, and some at that time are gassing.
The book of Mr. Englund is a departure from the historical book standard.
This is also an amendment to the idea that the First World War was only a heavy war in the West Front.
The “Beauty and Tribulation” is skilled with other military theatre: Alps, Balkans, East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are falling from beeleys; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unsolved problem is the much of cece.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane of Katrina, smelling in smoking dust.
When the cannada is near, and you're a woman and you're home with children, will you stay or run away?
Anyway, who's going?
Almost nobody understands what's going on and why to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," said Mr. England, "is fulfilled by speculations, assumptions, hopes, fears, intimidating ideas, theories of conspiracy, dreams, nightmares and hearings."
"Beauty and tribulation" follows the fate of people such as Florence Farmboro, the English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German fleet sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memoars, letters and other published materials.
The stories of their lives may be terrifying or exciting, but they are highly alive because of the minor moments and detailes collected by Mr. Englund.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with them.
Speaking of the German school girl's story, he says, "Erzat, everywhere."
"Deputy Officer, fake aluminium, non-existent rubber, paper ties, wooden buttons."
He continues to tell about the erzaz pizza in Germany.
It describes "meat of pressed rice, cooked in a bark fat (and decorated with a fake bone made of a tree); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potatoes; shoes woven by a tree."
It notes that there were "837 registered substitutes of meat permitted in the production of sausage, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories tell about honour and courage.
One American observes the desire to be cruel and says about the war, "You feel that, eventually, it is what men have been created for, rather than sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarette and whiskey, the evening newspaper or the bestselleer, and claiming that this show is a civilization and under your shirt shirt is not hiding."
The British soldier, on the contrary, observes that he will probably die and no one will notice it and will be regretted.
"When a man reconciliates himself with the thought of sacrifice, he would like to think that this would happen before the audience," he wrote.
But it's the opposite. It's like a "condemned man hanging secretly."
Other observations relate to the old Europe, which is declined, and the new types of fear.
"The conflict has become more economic competitive," said Mr. Englund, "military factories."
It notes the arrival of a person called "new species in the bestiary of the beginning century: a beautiful expression and ideologically convincing mass killer in a well sewed suit, which fits a cut, sitting at the table. "
People act unforeseenly: low deeds are as many as heroism.
Mr. Englund told soldiers who tried to tackle the prostitutes with a venery disease to avoid service on the front.
"The most graphic expression of this can be seen in the trading of a gonorrhea gnoy that soldiers were buying and smashing from their genitals in hope to get into the hospital," he wrote.
"We desperate have been putting him in the eye, which has often led to life's blindness."
Translated from Swedish Peter Graves for Mr. Englund flexible, but nebrous, beautifully suitable for his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how the war "freeed completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders force them to fight.
The best books on I World War were often indirect, such as "The Great War and Modern Memory" of Paul Fassel or novels such as "In the West Front without change" of Erych-Mary Remarca, not by exhausting historical work.
The book of Mr. Englund is included in this unsharp pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final that I can remember in the literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he came to the page with a list of characters, grabbed it out of your hands and burned it.
After a previous error, a thoroughly calculated raid
There were hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets.
The night clocks from Monday to Tuesday were selected because the Zucotti Park had to be at least people at that time.
The operation was kept secret from all other than several high-level officers, and the others first said they were leaving to learn.
The Commissioner of the police, Raymond W. Kelly, was in the centre of the event, emphasizing how much the Department of Police had intensified.
There could be no talk about the recurrence of the recent weeks, such as the use of a cross gas against protesters, which contradicted the rules of the department and caused the hurricane of the audience to occupants.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, police operation was launched to release the protesting Zukotti Park.
The authorities were preparing by watching occupation in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis doctrines were carried out on Randels Island, counting on Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called practices in the case of disorders, counter-terrorism measures, involving a rapid displacement of large numbers of police officers, in view of the Lower Manhattan.
Last training took place on Monday on the East River side.
The order to enter the park came in a "last minute", said the source familiar with orders in which the mission was mentioned only as "training".
"They are several cops I know and have not said they are being sent to Zucotti Park," said the man who spoke under the conditions of anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zucotti Park were at the highest posts in the department."
One of the reasons for confidentiality was a lesson that took the city.
The authorities wanted to clean up the park on 14 October, but they resigned to hundreds of protesters who were in front of the deadline, hearing about these plans.
Operations were attended on Tuesday by various police units, including police forces from districts, which were usually used to control criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as to work, come and leave the park during the day, making an hour of the night the time for the attack.
"It was right to do when the park was at least the people," he said.
The rescue machines with lighters and speakers were gathered on Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge before moving forward.
The lighter and previously recorded announcements of speakers appear to have scared many protesters.
When administrative units entered the park in their blue winds, many protesters simply gathered their things and left.
The police reported that the tents weren't touched until 1:45 p.m., giving the protesting people the time to collect things.
Other police groups, according to the witnesses, were gathered on the perimeter to enter if the park needed arrests.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the Department of Police, said that it was done for their security.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see the police and that the police treated them rudely.
Mr. Brown said that telecam cars on the Church Street, along the west border of the park, could have taken a picture.
When the police went west through the breasts of personal protesters, including bags, plastic carpets and polyethylene bags, full clothes, the Sanitary Department teams followed it, collecting what was abandoned.
Some protesters who refused to leave have been pulled out, and the photos of this soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions next to the kitchen camp, at the park center.
Some have built barricades, and the police were entering, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp’s epicentre were put together for their hands.
And two people tied themselves to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The rescue officers were called to cut the castles.
No arrests in the park were held until 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The cleaning operation was completed in approximately 75 minutes, reports the police.
Mr. Brown said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for " breach of public order and resistance to detention," he said.
The highest officer in the area was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and a senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the Department of Search, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, " did not run the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second police group was waiting for the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to enter.
Rooms were placed in Cortland Street, a quarter north of the park, and in Pine Street, in the neighborhood south.
Observers saw the police expand the perimeter even far beyond Zucotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night came south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of the police car, and others, according to the apparents, released air from the police car tyres.
At some point the crowd flyed a piece of a fan.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters had been hospitalized.
The trade union of school staff will court the city for dismissal
The union representing hundreds of school staff members who have lost place last month plans to court the city in the Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and discriminatory because of the unproportionate impact on schools where poor students are learning.
The judicial proceedings are likely the latest means available to the District Council 37 trade union to cancel dismissals.
Sixty-seventy-two school assistants, parents and other employees, who were among the lowest paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October, as the trade union leaders called political response to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds managed by the working groups to close the hole in the last spring budget.
City officials categorically rejected this charge.
At the hearings in the City Council last month, the Chancellor of Schools, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the releases were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the council members pared him, saying that nowhere in the budget had been indicated that school support staff would be fired.
The representatives of the District Council reported that they had notified claims by warning the Department of Education that it had been filed; a press conference would be held on Wednesday in order to announce a formal complaint to the Supreme Court of Justice in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Department of City Education will be indicated as defendants, and eight temporary employees are listed as prosecutors, all black or Latin American women, as well as most assistants who lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen a complaint and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
In accordance with the preliminary version of the complaint provided by New York Times, the trade union focused on several schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim for unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more assistants because they are chronially underfinanced.
He pointed out that, while there were no releases in Staten Island, and in the High East Side or Tribeka schools there were few, 17 subsidiary school workers lost their seats in district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to go to County 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of eight school assistants who worked in free high school 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This are not areas of rich parents who can find money to fulfil budget failures."
The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost the money when the city changed the way to calculate additional funding for each poor student entering school.
The Union also claims that the school director could be confused by the language of notification allowing the parents to be released from workers.
The word “surplus” has been used in the notification, although “surplus” is often said when a school paylist is transferred to the list of existing employees paid by the central office.
" Sixty-six focal points for work with parents were fired," the complaint said in the article, "and not just translated."
Mission completed, Congress is ready for Libya's agreement
The Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the rebellion in Libya.
All it needed was to succeed the rebellion, the ancient dictator Muamar Kaddafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention was completed.
On Tuesday, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate should consider the resolution made by the President John Kerry (democrat, Massachusetts) along with the Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), which praises the Levians for the successful rebellion and the American troops for " courage".
"The purpose of this resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya when they begin to restore their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of support for their democratic arrangements by both parties."
Language may seem harmless, but no further discussion on Libya was easy.
This summer, the legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions that endorse or condemn the role of the US Army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Carrie and McKain submitted a resolution allowing limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the Chamber of Representatives by a major majority of votes of both parties and has never reached a vote in the Senate.
However, the same day when the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the Chamber did not support the proposal that would cut down the funding of the US operation in Libya.
This left an American mission in something like a legislative cleaning area -- when the Congress was irritated enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not as angry as a matter of reality to blow the soil out of her feet.
The insolvency of the Congress was subsequently enshrined
In August, Tripoli was surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and Caddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate may now be ready to act.
The Resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "happies the people of Libya for its incredibly courage and unusual endurance in pursuing freedom" and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "recognizes the national interest of the United States in the successful and inverse transition to democracy in Libya".
Will new measures be fully supported by the Council on Foreign Affairs, or will be divided by legislators like the June bill?
Against the last version, Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not seen the last version of the bill.
On the other hand, the Capitol of the Chamber of Representatives this week should vote for a constitutional amendment that requires balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some democrats in the Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), would be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or anything else to be made to the convening of the Congress in plenary.
Other legislators had not yet made their amendments to the plenary meeting, but not because they did not try.
The amendment of Goodlat is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues that have been raised in this convention.
Some were duplied -- the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate -- others were minor differences.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendments to the balanced budget only in the Chamber of Representatives and a lot more on the " control of federal expenditures " .
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors -- mostly the newly elected republicans who wish to decorate their summary -- the opportunity to praise that they had made such a proposal.
The Act on Budget Control, which took place in August, required representatives and the Senate to vote for the amendment of the balanced budget.
In March 58 Senators voted for an unlimited resolution supporting the idea of amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen wished to limit the time limits for members of the Congress, and a member of the Chamber of Representatives Jose Serrano (democrate, New York) wished to cancel the restriction for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson, younger (democrat, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, inter alia, the right to quality education and health.
An amendment that prohibits single marriage has been offered for many years, as has also been forbidden by the flag of combustion.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the abolition of federal laws if two thirds of states object to them.
As the members of the Congress have tried to propose amendments, they have progressed no faster than in the past years.
In the 111th convening of the Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and 66 had been made in 110th.
This rate would be compared to the beginning of the 1990s, when members of the Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed over 150 amendments every two years.
But they had no more success than they did now.
The last amendment, which was adopted, 27th, was approved in 1992, but was actually submitted to the Congress in 1789.
"Bit but not conquered," said Giffords in his first television interview after an attempt.
Ten months after the armed man fired her on the public event in Tuson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on a federal channel on Monday night, he fought a melodie from the Broadway Summer Show, and said he wants more to recover than to return to Congress.
When A.B. News and Diana Sawyer appeared in the 20/20 programme, Giffords had hardly formulated proposals and needed help in walking.
The programme showed its difficult way to recover after the bullet injury, which broke the skull and broke the left side of the brain by passing from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she returned unexpectedly to the House of Representatives and triumphably voted on the bill of debt.
In his first television interview after January's shooting, which killed six and wounded 13 people, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang -- and called her healing difficult.
On the question of Sawyer, how she feels, 41-year-old Giffords said, "That's very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, Marco Kelly's astronaut, was part of an ad hoc "20/20", which was shown before the exit of the new book of Gabby: History of Courage and Hope.
Special Rapporteur reported the reconstruction of Giffords on 8 January.
On a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bed with a shaving head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a cart, and therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Shuffle your head.
Pull your lips out.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, Giffords said the second word, "toast", a request to change the breakfast menu.
The ABC video shows that music played a central role in the healing of Giffords: we see the congressman singing along with "The girls just want to entertain" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Patty.
In the interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, she said she didn't remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband told him that he read the Giffords article in the shooting paper on 12 March, when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed at the time.
The suspect who attacked Gerd Lee Lafner is in Missouri's prison and is subject to forced treatment in the expectation of a court.
"Mnogy people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Tough, heavy, hard."
One day during her healing, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm beaten."
And I said, "Gabby, you're not beaten," Kelly said.
You're just beaten.
And you're going through this, you're gonna get better and you'll come back stronger than ever.
Army feel more pity than respect
The event was a celebration in Wall Street, which gathered millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
On the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines were built around him.
The smoking audition applauded him standing.
"The soldiers were viewed as heroes," said David Salzman, who organized the spring collection of money.
The Senior Military Officer at the concert, at which there was also the Chairman of the Headquarters Committee, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans," the officer wrote in the e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respectful, it was pity.
The contrary impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American audience.
Armies are praised for their sacrifices.
But the commendations have their price, say soldiers.
The audience acts more as if she feels sorry for people in a form.
"We are not at all victims," said brigade General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and soon left to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy."
This is a sensitive topic for warheads who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger that returning troops faced during the recent years of war in Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most of the talks about regret occur quietly and only between war veterans.
After the two of his sons returned from battle in the marine, the Colonel resigned Mark Kenshn warned them that people not from the army would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admirement, because they have struck rebels and were in exotic places.
Others will think if the "masked by a cruel evil veteran," said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and returned to the high government position in Washington.
While he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could endure the tension of responsibilities in Washington immediately after the warfare.
Canshn recalls how he said to his sons, "When you tell about your service, you must count on the negative effect."
The embarrassment that the military experiences is partly from American indifference to wars.
The victories in the battlefield are rarely familiar with the country that is not aware of the army and has little direct benefits from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was normally in World War II," said the Lieutenant-General in resignation, David Barnow, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the audience is mainly focused on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
Armies appreciate the number of the marches they have done, by the number of companions they have lost, or by the scale of loss.
The army faces a growing pressure of members of the fight against rape
This week, the historic trials should decide whether 28 men and women against the army would be filed against rape.
If not, hundreds of prosecutors will be set up in order for the following.
The sergeant of the first grade, Elizabeth Lyman, 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy, claimed to have been raped by her associate at night.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar Airport, north of San Diego after dinner with another, and met a man-sponsor bearing a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But Texas' crop dismissed her fears.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instinct."
A few minutes after they entered the Lyman room, a man came back to her, crashed and raped, she claimed.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 current and former soldiers will be intense to wait for the court's decisions at the historic hearing that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and decide whether the case they have filed against the former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his precedent, Donald Rastfeld.
The case claims that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to deal with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The case filed in February by Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., originally included 17 plaintiffs, but grew up to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men who all claimed that they were raped or threatened by sexual violence by the servants and that the army did not properly investigate, prosecute or ensure proper justice after alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeted the top forces because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Burke also said that some 400 other victims had been contacted since February, many of which could participate in future wishes.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the prosecutors in this case, put all the eggs into one basket, so to say, it will open a lot of cases if it is necessary to support pressure.
The Protection Team from the Ministry of Defence under the leadership of the Federal Prosecutor Neal McBride has taken steps to stop the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek revealed the protection strategy, mainly that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army's claims for damages in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the decision of the Supreme Court of 1950, the federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by military personnel.
“The estimated damage is to the risk of the military service of the prosecutors,” states the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
Since the '50s, the situation has changed.
Although women are still officially banned to participate in the fight, this division exists only in words: Modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers play an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the battle area.
The result is that 150 women soldiers died between two wars, two thirds of them in battle.
The army is also time to become modern, says Burke.
It is not lonely in its struggle; in addition to its lawsuit, three others are preparing.
At the Yeal Legal School, the seminar of the veteran legal service is preparing a case against the four largest military academy on the promotion of a woman's hatred atmosphere.
The non-commercial union of American war veterans in Vietnam is preparing a suit against the army, in the centre of which the diagnosis of " change in personality " are subject to violence victims in order to remove them from service - a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhaguaya from the human rights group, the Organization of Women's Military Activities.
The group filed a complaint against the Veterans Office in December, accusing him of the discriminatory practice of reviewing pensions from people who claim to have been threatened by sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate laws offering a number of measures were introduced to the Congress by a group of senators and members of the Chamber of Representatives from both parties.
According to the Prevention and Combating Sexual Violence Service of the Ministry of Traffic, 3.158 attempts were reported in 2010.
However, as is known, the attacks are often not reported, and, according to Pentagon's own estimates, the figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19.000 cases that occurred that year.
The report published in March also examined the percentage of trials: in 2010, 20 per cent of the known cases were brought to court, twice as in the civil justice system.
The claimants in the Burke case call the attacks only the first in a number of other traumas.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of the rape separately 11 times the fiancée of police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of proofs of rape, and the blood of the attacker -- from a cut on her hand -- was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before the judge at the hearing, asking her whether she had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people have given positive characteristics to the accused who was finally justified.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Limann said.
"I thought I was having a baby now -- I ran out of the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in the psychiatric department, and when I went out, I remember my commander said, "It wasn't a trial on him, it was a court against me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her personal change, which made her unfit to service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with disadvantaged formulation, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
If the case is advanced, the Limann and its companions in the lawsuit is a difficult question, said John Terley, a professor of law at the University of George Washington.
However, he said, "I think they are able to move forward."
The doctrine that has been criticized since it had come.
I've been criticizing Doctrine Ferres all my life.
The army has been retired for decades because she has no incentives and restraints that are responsible.
He adds: "The chances are highly against them... but it is important for them to try."
These things are changed only when the decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not for them, Burke, the lawyer of the prosecutors, will collect hundreds of other prosecutors for future cases.
"We will continue to fight with the army on this matter until there is reform," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens before.
The walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before being a new person of real extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Brawick was a common guy who exposed his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravic, acknowledged the mass murder in Norway in July, which took 77 lives, appeared at his first open trial.
Although Bravic was able to act alone, he was far from lonely in the network: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support the right groups in social networks.
After summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how can we find them?
It's easy to go to Facebook.
"We have realized that it is not difficult to reach them," said Jamie Bartlett, the author of the recently published report on the European Cyber Populism of the British DEMOS Research Centre.
Personal data stock on Facebook is so large, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the site's advertising tool to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy -- that marketers have been doing for years.
The Bartlett team found half a million fans of the right groups across Europe and then advertized them, but instead of showing a new group or a diet product, the advertising offered the user to conduct a survey on their educational level, violence and optimism regarding their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries were able to interrogate, even without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to study," said Bartlett.
Some results are not so impressive: online parties to the right groups are most commonly young men of male sex, dissatisfied by immigration.
But suddenly, "the ones who combine their online activity with offline activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less aggressive than those who are just hiding behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, researchers and politicians use the site to explore everything in the world - from health to social trends expressed in the "Lykes ", wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding to the average of three records a day, “super-actual information” of the Facebook calls for a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles named the website by 800 per cent for the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's beauty is that it gives the opportunity to study people who are unable to approach in the street with a recording.
"After, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have had to join the party and they would never accept you," said Bartlett.
"Facebook turns out all of this -- you're turning directly to them."
Others say that the site could identify and explore social health problems.
The last study of Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drunkness in Facebook were much more subjected to the risk of alcoholism than students silent about this.
Moreno suggests that students, such as their social teachers, could monitor the site and interfere to help a student who has too often updated drunk status.
"You cannot solve the problem without identifying it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-autor Moreno and Director of the Centre for Children's Health, Behaviour and Development at the Child Research Institute of Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify children from a risk group that would not otherwise be found."
The Facebook is also constantly retrieving data on its users.
The site ' s data processing group processed the status statistics and the Valentine Day, the phenomenon of voters in the mid-term 2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (using mainly information available only to them, the cyber freedom champions had long insisted that the site should make its wide collection of data available to research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play in Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants of the research they don't even know?
While researchers have strictly certain offline research standards, online data are publicly available.
"I don't think many users were at least wondering what a researcher could observe their profiles," said Neil Selvin, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, on the study that he conducted in 2006 using the public accessible pages of students in Facebook.
"How they imagined, it was only between them and their friends."
The question of methodology is then.
Even offline does not guarantee that the study is fair.
On Facebook, it is not possible to figure out how much information is true in the profile and on the user's page.
"What you're saying on Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook is two absolutely different things," said Salvin.
That is why, despite his years of technology research, Selvin believes that the notebook and pen is still the best research tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the exit of the real world and communication with real people," he said.
"Social research is estimated to be social and most of the social is still offline."
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Bering Breywick will be publicly presented in court for the first time
Anders Bering Breywick, a person who admitted a double attack organized by 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter of resistance during the first public appearance in Oslo court.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Knights of Tampliers of Norway," he said before 500 present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognise action, but I don't admit guilt."
Judge Torkyel Nescheim interrupted Breywick during this monologue because he "not wanted to give Breywick the opportunity to use this hearing as a field to express his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to authorize Brevik, who brought the pre-written speech with himself, to contact the victims’ relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Brevic in custody for 12 weeks, banned access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and census for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and family victims visited the hearing.
Some came to hope to see Brevic in the eye, others to make sure he's locked up.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," told the Norwegian NRK channel one of the survivors in Utoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but I personally felt a little easier after I saw and heard the suspect."
Brawick, dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, kept calm and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked in the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite the strange idea of Bravic that he was part of the great movement of opposition, the judge decided that he was not mad and said there was no evidence that he had acted with his associates.
Some may reassure the attacks of a extremist, not a group of radicals on 22 July.
But it does not automatically reduce the tribulation and disturbance that the whole nation now feels.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it's not," said one victim's relative.
"It would be much easier if it were."
7 lessons from the lost interview of Steve Jobs showed in the theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford, describeing the technical genius as the Great Designer of Modernity.
But the fact that Apple fans could view as the greatest opening in the recently discovered interview that they remembered in the preliminary markets this week is as much as this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
Of course, he was a designer, a dreamer and considered himself a hippie, but he was also an excellent organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business managers suffered from "a sickness to think that a really big idea of work is 90 percent... [but] a great idea from a large product is separated from a huge amount of artificial work."
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the Triumph Triumph on the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long-term conversation.
Until then, it was about 10 years since Jobs was expelled from Apple, and he had worked all the time in his new NeXT computer company, waiting for a mass networking.
While a small part of the Kringley interview was used in Nerds, he said the original interviews were missing during transportation.
Only after Jobs died, a full VHS copie was found in the director's garage.
This recorded material, a little edited, was the basis for the 68-minute film, Steve Jobs: The lost interview that was being made at Landmark Theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man familiar with his hatred for detailed interviews, Jobs seemed unusual to expose his technological philosophy and business strategies here.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different moments, there are large intervals between questions and answers -- thinking for 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobs clearly raises his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments where Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems to be irritated by Kringley's issues that make him move faster to issues or phenomenons of greater importance.
In the epoch of Pixar, iPods and iPhones, the Lost Interview is something more vicious when Jobs appreciates what he sees different companies are doing right and wrong, and proposes his own vision of future information technology.
It's one thing to read about Jobs' post-mortem evaluations, but there's something wounded and inspiring in Jobs, which we see here, anxious dreamer on the edge of the greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of seven significant conclusions of the Lost Interview:
About how he was learning to manage business:
"After all the time in the business, I kept asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers you always get, "Oh, it's just just doing it."
No one knows why they're doing what they're doing, nobody thinks in business very deeply.
That's what I learned.
Jobs continues to describe its efforts to rationalize the reporting in the Apple.
The disturbed way of writing the costs that often began with the "standard costs" that were taken from the ceiling and then carried out by "clear" was that he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they would be able to monitor business expenditures all the way to small.
About the joke on the Pope:
Jobs detailed the "Blue Box" that he made with Steve Wozniak -- a device that allowed people to effectively break into the phone company and call a large distance free.
The device has been written a lot earlier, but Jobs' eufory was here when he described the blue box as an act of power infectious.
He tells him how he and Wozniak tested the box using the automatic phone, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to the other until they were tied as many stations as possible.
"We caught the earth's ball half a dozen times, and you screamed on the phone machine, and it was a minute later in the next phone car," said Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we have adopted was that we could make something that could control billions of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could make a little thing that could control the big thing -- it was an amazing lesson, and I don't think without that, Apple would ever appear.
Jobs continues to describe a famous exit that he and Wozniak practically managed by calling to Vatican through the blue box at midnight and asking Papa for the phone, trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, these two were laughing right before the Pope was raised to answer on the phone.
About in love with technology (and coldly called Bill Huletta):
When he was 12 years old, he found Bill Hughlett in a phonebook and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received summer work at Hughlett Packard.
"It had a strong influence on me, it was the only company I've seen at that age, and it has formed my view of what the company is and how well they treat their staff."
Jobs later became one of HP staff who visited the research labs of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw the "first desktop computer".
He was a size of a suitcase, he had a small monitor with an electronic radiation pipe, and I fell in love with him.
I frequently traveled to HP as a teenager and rolled around the car and wrote programs for it.
Improvised innovation:
In several places, Jobs' interviews refers to the invention of new products in the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a bunch of mounted plates, one buyer asked him to gather a whole computer.
During only 30 days of the loan, he had to consider both the collection and the delivery of ready devices.
Later at Apple, he remembers the difficulties he faced by developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the rageous disputes... they screamed at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], and I was sick on my throat, and I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could gather for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
Great energy-related companies:
Long before he was headed by Apple, Jobs had clearly predicted that many sector leaders were wrong to see the situation and would lose control of their market shares.
"Let's we say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're making a better copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [they are the types of people] who eventually come to the leadership of companies, and the producers are exhausted from the decision-making area.
The product genius that led to this monopolyst position is exhausted by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products, the required art.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the whole information technology industry.
He could have been ten times more, he could be a Microsoft in the '90s...
They were defeated from victory.
Innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea of the great product is separated from a huge amount of artificial work... when you're making a big idea, it's changing and growing."
You'll learn a lot about her delicateness.
There are compromises to which you need to go -- some things you can't force to do electronics, glass, robots or factories.
You have to keep 5,000 ideas in your head, these concepts, connecting them all together...
Finally, it's a taste -- it's all about trying to express itself in the best thing people ever produced, and later, trying to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, big artists steal.
We were always ashamed of stealing big ideas.
Part of what Macintosh did to the famous, was that people who worked on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had become best information technology experts in the world.
If not information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are having lunch with opponents of the Health Law while the court is considering the case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered outside the closed door to discuss a political dispute whether he would listen to President Obama's health law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were held at the lunch sponsored by a legal firm that would dispute the case before the Supreme Court.
This case took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions.
One of the cases on the agenda was the application supported by 26 States that contested the rapid health review adopted by the Congress last year, the law that unified conservative activists of the entire nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the reverse debate was expected at 5 1/2 hours in March 2012, and the outcome was likely to be a disturbance in the presidential race, which would be in the middle of the time the judicial decision was announced.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the law of health should be repealed will probably be Paul Clement, who was the Deputy Prosecutor General during the Presidentship of George W. Bush.
The Legal Company of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozens of companies that helped sponsor the annual lunch of the Federal Society, a long-term existing group, constantly retaining conservative legal principles.
Another company, who sponsored lunch, represents one of the trade associations that contested the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the end of the gravity.
The lunch was held in the Washington hotel a few hours after the trial meeting.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a famous opponent of the Health Law.
Honourable guests at dinner?
Nothing new: Two judges have been visiting the Federal Society for many years.
And this is not contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, the judges are free from the Code of Behaviour, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were obeyed, they might have reached the principle of the 4C Code, which states: "The judge may attend charity activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge cannot be a rapporteur, an honorable guest or to be mentioned in the programme of such an event."
However, the apparent closeness of Scalia and Thomas to two legal companies in this case, as well as the company with great financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the Government.
"This remarkable violation of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains true to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Act.
"The judges had been drinking and suppering on the official cash stock with lawyers whose cases are currently being dealt with in court."
Their appearance and assistance in gathering money for this event undermines all statements of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas are barely paying attention to criticists who say they are very willing to mix trials with groups such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas's wife, Jeannie, is a famous conservator activist.
Furthermore, the Conservatories claim that this is an ethical issue with regard to Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the primary legal service in the Obama Administration when the first judicial objections against the law were filed at the court level of the first instruction.
Her criticists demanded that Kagan refuse to hear this case because she was too involved in the protection of the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show that she was going to do that.
Boeing gets a recorded 18 billion flight order
The Emirates airline orders 50 broad-fly ships Boeing 777 and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, a deal size of over one billion dollars.
It's hardly news that the company gets a procurement for 50 units of its product.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft engineer, and the prevalent price for all these 50 planes is $18 billion.
It is so important where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing golden living for planes.
In the forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced his biggest $$ equivalent order for commercial planes on this weekend - 50 two-way Boeing 777.
The incredible order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an opportunity to buy 20 other aircraft that will raise the total pre-scoring price to $26 billion, said Boeing at the Aviashow Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, said Boeing, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which could be commended by much better fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The pre-scoring price for six planes will amount to more than one billion dollars.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said Morningstar Neal Diora.
"The quality of these specific buyers is quite high."
Many of the Middle East aircraft are owned by oil-producing countries.
Consequently, they have not only money to pay for aircraft but also to increase the prices of fuel, which usually damages airlines, since this is one of their largest costs, is not so destructive because the country earns money at high oil prices.
This is important, as they are less likely than other airlines will cancel the order of aircraft when prices rise, said Diora.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership on the market of broad-flying aircraft and helps to avoid attempts by airbus SAS to reach its sovereignty with its A350 airliner.
The Boeing victory at the Airbus show took place four months later after Airbus stated that it would postpone the largest A350, which competed just with 777-300ER.
He postponed the debate to increase the axle load after the buyers demanded to increase the elevation and distance of flight.
Boeing Co shares increased by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The President's sister of Mexico appears to have lost the elections in Michoacana
Louisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers were helping Fausto Valého from the IRP in the pre-electoral race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed not to have made a request for Governor Michoacana during the harsh public elections, and she stated on Monday that the drug dealers had helped to make a race for one of its opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the Governor of the Western State is called Fausto Valého from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
"The intervention of organized crime during the entire election process, especially yesterday, causes anxiety not only to Michoacana but also to the whole country," Louisa Maria Calderon said in the radio interview the next day after the Sunday vote.
"They frightened our candidates, our electoral employees... they took the urna for vote, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IRP.
The IRP had managed Mexico for seven decades until she had lost presidentship in 2000.
It is preparing the return, and the victory in Michoacana is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP is hoping to win presidential elections in July.
Valeyo seems to have only been a little overlooked by Calderon, who was leading the ratings before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or the PND headed by her brother, refused to acknowledge Valjeho as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, which now belongs to the governor's chair, came to a third serious defeat for separate and inadequate lefters before the presidential elections 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize preliminary results.
Valého, former mayor of the capital of the state of Morella, denyed links with drug dealers and called on other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacana, drug cartels specialized in marihuana, heroin and metamphetamines have long been ruled.
This is the native state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence still continues.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the elections when he agitated for Louise Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local pre-electoral race because of fear.
For the IRP, however, no matter how terrible the elections in Michoacana would be, the victory will give the party the move impulse.
A man who should represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Neito, saying from Washington, congratulated Valyo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the front of the next year."
ABB persuade Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank committed India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term decline that will stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ABR office in Manile, said that two fast-developing large economies should " do everything they can" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block with either the International Monetary Fund or the direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries looked at the difficulties of Europe ' s " impartial" and said that Asian financial assistance to the side with European leadership and resources could help to avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
"Therefore, anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he informed the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be insecure."
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, the loans of Italy have increased threateningly, and both the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The long-term crisis in Europe raised fears that it could bring the world economy back to the recession and led to the calls of leading developing economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian assistance would be carried out through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation, such as the purchase of EU financial assistance bonds, was a means to ensure financial stability in Europe, provided great force in the negotiations to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister for Trade, said that India would do everything possible to help the eurozone, since its own economy is now under way of reducing exports and reducing foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unstable," he said.
"We have great tasks, and we must support high growth."
"It's not an option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we can find a job for tens of millions of our youths and girls."
Others claim that there is no point for developing economies like India to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Warshni, a professor at the Brown University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult to assist Europe with 1.2 billion Indians, of whom about 800 million live for $2 per day or less.
"They will find out at some point that the Greeks are retired at 50 years of age and go to sea's holidays, and that will not be accepted well," he said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, was also wondering why India's reserves should be used to contain Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers in badly organized, loss enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the crisis of the eurozones threatened " significant direct consequences" throughout Asia.
The ABB estimated 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 has now faced “degrading risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets need to draw " extreme plans " to protect themselves from decline and significant capital flows from their economies.
Critical warnings of Pentagon on potential defence reductions
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, warned the situation on Monday at the Congress that the expected automatic reductions of the budget would undermine national security and cause a financial chain response from Pentagon's corridors to battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil Assembly.
Pentagon is already used to reducing $450 billion in the forthcoming decade, but is now afraid that additional reductions of 600 billion or more could be inevitable if the congress could not reach the cost agreement.
"The consequences of these reductions will be destructive for the Ministry," Panette reported in a letter to the senators, John McKain, Arizona, and the Republic of Lindsay Greham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of the Congress to adopt the budget agreement and the so-called sequence initiate a universal reduction by 23 per cent and the termination of many new projects.
"This strong reduction, which is used in such a sense, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction incomplete -- you cannot buy three quarters of ships or buildings -- and serious damage to other attempts to modernize," Panette wrote to the senators.
"We must also force many of our civilian workers to be fired and since the reduction will be made so quickly, we will be almost sure to fire civilians in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and cause serious damage to war preparedness."
The reductions will eventually be affected by the military parts, said Panette.
"Although military funding in Foreign Emergency Operations is not directly affected by the sequest, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets," Panetta warned.
“Contractual staff will be reduced that it will end with annulment of the contracts and the supervision treaty that supports the troops.”
"A national staff will be reduced, which will result in delays with military suppliers' payments, and legal and political support will be violated."
Two senators wrote Panette 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible effects of automatic reductions in the Defence Ministry.
"The sequester in the Defence Ministry will become the rapid decline of the United States as the leading world military force."
"We stand firmly against these dragon acts," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday night when they announced Panetta's letter.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we're supposed to put on."
"The Sequest is a threat to the interests of national security of the United States, and this cannot happen."
Whether Panetta's letter or recent warnings from the senators to the budget compromise or strengthen the calls for Pentagon to be released from reductions, we will see later.
Panetta was absolutely honest about possible reductions, although he had come to work in Pentagon’s leadership after many years of conducting budget expertise in the Congress and the White House and realizing that he faced difficult choices.
At the press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew a distressed picture of what could follow -- army with a shell but without a core.
"This is a ship without sailors."
"It's a bullet crew."
"It's the wing of the plane without enough prepared pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, a warehouse army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently prepared soldiers able to perform the mission," Panette said in its introductory comments in Pentagon.
"It is the power that suffers from an unsustainable fighting spirit, bad willingness, and is unable to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In the annex to his letters to McKain and Greham Panetta, he raised new details of how reducing significant operational risks are arising: delaying the response to crisis, conflicts and disasters; seriously limiting our possibility to be the first in deployment and response everywhere in the world; and leading to unacceptable risks in future battle operations.
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could face obstacles, including those already passed tests, and some only in early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 strike executioner, a planned new bomber, a ballist submarine boat of a new generation, a new coastal boat and a new ground fighting vehicle that the Army and the Marines need to be replaced by the hammer.
The further development and testing of F35 could save 80 billion dollars in 10 years, but its supporters say that it is a vital next step to improve and resist potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to catch a lie
The view of the recent titles shows how serious and widely lies and lies in daily life.
The candidate for the Presidents of the Republicans, Herman Kane, has been engaged in the contesting of sexual harassment by several women; each party accuses the other of lies.
The Pennsylvania University Administration was charged with false testimony, as they seemed to have hid that the football coach had been raped by boys.
Last week, President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, was captured when, with the microphone involved, President of the United States, Barak Obama, told Israel's Prime Minister Binjamin Netanjahu, a liar.
The lie destroys career and shakes the countries.
Congressman of New York and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weiner turned himself fool, denying his abduction, which was quickly rejected by uncontrollable evidence.
The former candidate at President John Edwards was accused of financial fraud during a campaign related to the concealing of extra-border relations.
And again, none of the living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who was fake about their sexual relations with Monica Levinsky during his second post.
The history of fraud at school and college examinations is an ordinary case.
There were cases when the teachers were giving the students the answers to the tests so that they could have a good assessment of the results of their activities.
The teachers who should teach the opposite shall report that lies and fraud are acceptable.
What number of lies are we facing?
During one day, research shows you may lie between 10 and 200 times.
Now it is expected that a significant part of this is a lie to save.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times for the first 10 minutes of each other.
The detection of lies or lying requires every skill for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a bedroom game, as we say, the charades that should be called "Happed!", the detection of a lie is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the past six decades in prestigious universities dealing with comprehensive research projects, especially on psychology and physology.
One of the results of the study was that most of the old myths of lies were divorced.
Liars look in the eye.
They don't always get stuck, screaming, red, or vulnerable.
We should not conclude that liars are difficult to be observed and that it is difficult to disclose.
The experiencing disclosure of lies can reach the truth by observing the structure of allegations, mimic, the structure of issues and temporary characteristics.
I spent several years exploring scientific discoveries in a wide and constantly growing segment of knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the discovery of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and which helps in orienting in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruitment, interviews, negotiations or management.
Good liars are excellently able to read others, making them feel uncompelled, controlling their own emotions and intuitively feel how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts that men lie more about themselves, while women are usually to protect someone's feelings that married people are less lying to their partners than unmarried (but the lie they say is most urgent).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How can we know if anyone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called "determination of the original state".
This helps to ensure the reference point for the assessment of changes further.
Watch your position, laugh, voice characteristics.
You should know if a person knocks with his legs in a normal state, then you will not make unfair accusations when you see the knocking of his legs in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of verbal and unverbal acts.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of fraud.
The deceives can fix the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their steps towards the door, bend to the exit, change their position in a certain way or demonstrate " relief after interview" -- this excessive breath of relief and change of position when all complex issues are behind.
The investigators often fake the interrogation signal to just look at this relief after the interviews.
So, pay attention to your object's speech.
It is known that Scott Peterson had fallen down and used the past time, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, leading to her searches throughout the country.
The people who are in the way that they can also use the distance in the speech, "I had no sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinsky" or to repeat the complicated question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely captured.
Someone can use a qualifying language when he answers the complicated question, "Okay... truthfully... as far as I know... as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and it is often a red flag.
There is no magic means to detect a lie, but it can be managed to find a fake.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone not to be victim of artificial fraud in professional and personal life.
The controversial plan for the construction of oil pipeline needs to be revised after the United States threat to defer its approval
A few days later, after the Administration of Obama threatened to delay the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Mexican Gulf, caused anger of trade unions, but reassured environmental defenders, the oil-construction company claimed that it would be willing to revise the project to resume its work.
TransCanada reported on Monday night that it would remove the planned oilwater from the environmentally sensitive region of the Sand Hills in Nebraska and are sure that the project will still be approved.
The company made this decision at the press conference in the Capitol of the state of Nebraska.
The official representative of TransCanada Alex Purbas said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive the approval of the oil pipeline, although with another route.
This happens after the State Department statement last week, that it will postpone a decision on the project at the federal level until it explore new possible routes that do not affect the region of the Nebraska Sand Hills and Ogalala aquifer, a huge underground stock of water.
"It is a real step forward," said Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise ordered by the State Department will probably dismiss before 2013, after the next year elections, although the authorities denyed that policy had been involved in this decision.
In his written statement last week, Obama called the decision to the State Department and expressed its support.
Oilwater length of 1.700 miles shall be extended from Canada to the Mexican Gulf.
He must transport 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta province to oil-race factories in Texas.
In order to implement this, he has to cross six states.
He is hated by environmental defenders, but they love trade unions that hope for about 20,000 jobs related to oil-product.
However, the Nebraski legislators, speaking against the plan, are considering the draft legislation to accelerate the movement from the area of the Sand Hills and the Aquifer of Ogalala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study of the State Department on the environmental impact showed that the project would only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source in the energy industry stated that the Department ' s auditor had ordered a separate expertise on the process of review, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the Lobbist employed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a advisor in the 2008 Hillary Clinton campaign, is a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another was whether the choice of a company which was hired to conduct an initial study was inappropriate, since it was related to TransCanada.
Patty Labelle was sued because she seemed to have caused a child's painfulness.
The New York family claims that Patti LaBelle's disco-divoked folks began to run into their homes in Manhattan, frightening their minor daughter to such a degree that it was so frightened.
The Tirade of the Lady Marmalade frightened the 18-month Genevieve Monk so much that she passed the " change of personality, sleep disorder" and the "potential fear of strangers," said her family at the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This happened on 10 November last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, child gardener, Rosanna, and Genevieve were going to a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was hunting the car, Rosanna Monk came down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Building with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosana Monk said she stopped at the door and put her daughter down for a minute.
Someone came to me back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBelle angryly made an appointment to a pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," Rosana Monk said.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She came in anger and began to use screwing -- the word on C and the word on F -- in high tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had a hysteric.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle attacked the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escorters had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, Rosana Monk said.
The little girl cried so much that she was screaming, she added.
Later, the family sent a note from Labelle with apologies, but did not respond.
Lawyers and representatives of Labelle do not respond to comments.
The amount of compensation for damage was not reported, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken the case for free and that the family planned to sacrifice any money that he would receive, for the charity of children, with a diseased cancer.
"The goal is to force Patty Labelle to be responsible for her actions," said Davis.
"It is completely inadmissible, especially in respect of a child's garden teacher with a 18-month child in his hands."
Climate problems slowed the economy
During the first year of the rule of Mario Lopeza in Sinaloa, unemployment has increased and the illegal labour market, foreign funding has decreased and the economy has been weakened.
2011, which will enter the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Waldes, also referred to as a year of change, which produced great hopes for economic development, but given the disadvantaged climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but a reduction in the main economic development indicators had been registered.
Low temperatures in February did not only result in loss of millions for the agricultural sector but limited the growth of the public economy, causing a reduction in economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, affecting the dynamic of other economic sectors.
According to the report on the areas affected by the ice cream provided by the Mexican Council on Sustainable Rural Development, 835.582 hectares were affected by 78.03 per cent, and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected, and mainly damaged cultures were vegetables, corn and nutes.
The decline in economic activity has resulted, by November, the continuous growth of unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute for Statistics and Geographic, during the first three blocks, increased acceleration of unemployment, from January to March 55.053 of the inhabitants of Sinaloa, with a share of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, the second quarter increased to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September it continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, the share of more than 74.000 unemployed residents of Sinaloa, with 18.9 per cent higher in comparison to the first half.
Reduction of liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa over the year has been addressed by many factors for the economist Gerardo Lopez Servantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the growth of unemployment could be explained indirectly, by actions taken in public policy.
"What we now see is the growth of unemployment, which is related to several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market to limit the resources imposed by the law, which was adopted in the convention to combat money laundering, as people who have illegally owned dollars are difficult to work with them, invest and use them in something," he said.
Sustained immigration
Lopez Servantes said that there is also a demographic factor in unemployment growth.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of abroad have been limited in the United States, primarily because of entrance difficulties, and secondly, since they once flew, they have already faced many difficulties in searching for work, so the group of people remains and requires jobs here, in the state, growing unemployment," he said.
Infringement of formal requirements
Analysis of the Labour Market of Sinaloa is worse when attention is given to a large number of infringements that prevail under the conditions of work, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population of the State work without being mentioned as employees in any social protection agency.
In addition to unemployment and infringements, another reminder of the state's work is presented by low wages; the lowest wages in the country are in the state, according to the records of the Mexican Institute for Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of the workers of Sinaloa was by September 5.352 peso, much below the country's average of 7.375 pesos.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and high decline in unemployment in 2011, the largest share of foreign direct investments in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630.697 from January to July, which showed a fall of 87.74 per cent compared to $5.143.312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Government has only fixed 17.280,000 pesso investments during the year, which mainly came to services companies.
Long
In the context of the economic decline, the Government of the State requested, in July, the country's congress, the credit approval of 3 billion pesos, which would be used for investments in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to recover the economy, only 2.600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no debt advantages were expected until November in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Waldes demonstrates the lack of government capabilities.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, President of the National Industry Producing Chamber, said that during 2011 there had been no consensus to the wishes of various sectors, including the Government itself.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, we have to work a lot to recover the positions lost in this year, in 2012, we must double our efforts, we have failed to harmonize the efforts of all and, first of all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economy slowing
Lopez Loredo said that events such as early freezing had stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth this year were limited.
"Low economies are the result of several events, including freezing, one of the main effects was a slow economy that did not become sufficient to create economic dynamic, which allows the acceptable level of processes, goods and services, and therefore we close it below our expectations at the end of the year," he said.
Review of the direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state should continue the most dynamic production activity.
"In general, we have discovered that we have worked on this, we believe that a long-term programme that will re-determine the direction and economic course of the state is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that they have in Sinaloa," he said.
Forthcoming work
President Coparmex emphasized the importance of defining the future direction in order to improve the Government ' s efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, a small progress in economic development terms, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has demonstrated progress in its own public policy manner.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved in work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government realizes that there is a lot else to do," he said.
He's sentenced for 8 pounds of marihuana.
Five years of prison and a fine of income in 100 days - such a sentence was sentenced to Navolato for storing eight kilograms of marihuana.
The Prosecutor General reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valensuela Sandoval, was convicted of the crime against health, in this case the preservation of marijuana for dissemination.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valensuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military forces on 7 June 2010 during the patrol of the street of Cypriano Valdes, before post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white car truck in which he carried a black bag in a car box, and on a passenger seat, a small bag where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For these reasons, the exemption was transferred to the Second District Court, and the accused remained in prison in the Centre for Legal Effects of Crime.
We need to make contributions to the work
Public work, such as Family, Rescue of Public Space and 3x1 for migrants, risks to remain incomplete or long-term because of the lack of funds, said Miguel Angel Lopes Miranda.
The Director of the Municipal Social Development pointed out that, although the work programmes were still developing, they were in danger, since the Government of the State was unable to contribute to the amount of 11 million pesso for all three programmes.
He noted that the overall funding of all three programmes was about 50 million pesos, of which the state should be 25 per cent, and only the Federation and the Municipality were still providing resources for work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They should invest nearly 12 million, and although the year is over, they did not give us a coin when they had to give us a part at the beginning of July," he said, "to avoid delay, we started work and they made a lot of progress, but we need money."
He mentioned that during the last year, during the rule of Jesus Aguillar Padilli, the State had not made contributions that it had to make, so at the beginning of the municipality run, it had to be borrowed to cover more than seven million, the amount that was not provided by the State administration.
"It happened to us in the previous administration because the State had no financial opportunities for participation and programmes continued to develop, and this year, in order to get access to these programmes, we need resources to cover what remains in the state," he explained.
While the authorities of the State are obliged to deliver these resources, he said that the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villiareau, to increase their efforts so that the percentages relating to them would come as soon as possible.
"They must bring nearly 12 million, and even though the year ends, they didn't give us any money."
The Court will endorse a digital television transition in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of similar signals for digitals is one of the most important changes that have achieved the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court (WC) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which transmits the so-called " digital television" from 2021 to 2015, as eight votes needed for its cancellation were not collected.
The minority of four ministers, including the Chairman of the Court, Juan Silvu Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his powers, issued a decree with a detailed description of action to move to digital ground TV.
As a result, the constitutional claims declared by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to speak on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the Decree and remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olgoy Sanchez Cordero suggested that the decree be declared non-constitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme is the right enshrined under the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) in violation of the principles of hierarchy subording and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
According to this argument, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to deny the decree and support complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it relating to the transition to the digital broadcast.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to dismiss the requirement of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive authority could not determine the general rules of action to be prepared by the State administration.
"I also don't believe that if this had been done, it would have affected the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and recalled that the planning of public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, had an impact on the federal executive authority with a constitutional mandate, the governance of a State.
The replacement of similar signals to digitals - one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years has resulted in better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Deferring the transition, he said, would mean delaying the benefit from conversion into a digital form, which includes satisfying public needs that have not only technical dimensions, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he said, "need the work of the whole system educated under the principle of public economic governance, includes a group of authorities that the Constitution is uniting into the State Executive Authority."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital broadcast, and it had done so through the executive authority, despite the existence of acute technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded that, taking the decree discussed, which in any case affects the competences of the Congress, the Government would in administrative sphere of compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
Michoacana analyzes the possibility of " voice after voice "
According to the PRW data, the difference between the first and second elections is only 27 per cent, even without a summary of 879 votes from the total of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of the " voice after voice" calculation is real about the election process in Michoacana this year, where, according to the preliminary election results programme (PPRV), the difference between the first and second seat in the governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without the total number of 879 votes in 6.074 protocols.
In the light of that, the President of the General Council of the Institute of Election of Michoacana (IWM), Mary de Los Angeles Ljanderal Saragosa recalled that several days ago, 9 November, the electoral body adopted a package of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacan did not adopt the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Law Act, since the Congress of the State approved reforms shortly before the legal time of their entry into force in this electoral process, and Governor Leonel Godo Rangel did not include its publication in the period set out in the law in the Official Journal of the State, saying that he had some objections.
On the same day, on 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (CTY) adopted a decision on the constitutional claim issued by the local legislative Assembly and called the “incorrect and illegal” vote of the representative of the State on the constitutional reform, as he has no right to “resolute or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of " voice by voice ", Maria de los Angeles Ljanderal argued that, with the adoption of the relevant principles by the General Council, the IWM would be possible to present partial or complete summary of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, a partial list of one or more electoral urns may be made if: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no record of voting and summary of documents in the urna or it is not with the chairperson; or if there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
Furthermore, the total list of votes in all elections may occur when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged candidate winner and those who have received the second seat in the vote, less or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the representative of the Party and/or the coalition, which set out the second of those candidates.
The total list of votes will also be made if at the end of the regular summary is determined that the difference between the winner and the second candidate, less or equal to one per cent, provided there is a request from the political party whose candidate took the second place, where the electoral urnas are excluded, which were taken into account in partial recalculation.
It is noted that there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the PRW, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, not even 129 votes from the total number of 923 protocols.
His last will
His dust will be expanded in the mountains of Sapalinam, confirmed by the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortez arrived in Saltilo, his hometown on Sunday night; on Monday, there was a testimony and a deadly mess.
According to the family, the latest will of the colonel was to be expelled in the mountains of Sapalinam.
After condolences with other people who died in the disaster, the family of Basio Cortes returned to the capital of Coauilla on the aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, and the closest people visited the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At the afternoon, the colonel's dust arrived in a clock located on Nazario Ortis Garcia, where the family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 a.m., he conducted a review of the Santillo Technology Institute, organized by his former school classmates and football team, who was a member of Felipe Basio during high school.
"His desire was to return to Saltillo, and for his dust to be sprayed in the mountains of Sapalinam, he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot's sister.
She believed that the colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, she believed that he was on the top of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother who was loyal to his family."
Felipe Cortez Basio left Saltilo in a very young country to attend the Aviation College in Sapopan, Kalisco.
Some didn't believe him, they said he had his head around even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream as a pilot.
His nephew, Jorge Alberto Davila Basio, remembers him as a very good man, "when he arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him, like when he brought Marta Saagun to Saltillo."
He recalls that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Sapopan for his family’s graduation ceremony, so he knows that his uncle died by doing what he loved most in his life — by running the plane.
He's being conducted in the last path
The shootings from the weapons were launched by the Colonel of Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortez Basio, headed by Governor Jorge Torres Lopez, people from the village and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, the leaders and students of the Technological High School in Saltillo, in which he was studying in 1985 and doing success and in the school, and in the sport, performed it last time.
Basio Cortez died recently when the helicopter he had suffered a crash, along with the Secretary of the Province Government, Jose Francis Black More, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05 the remains of Basio Cortez (cremised), the resident Saltillo, arrived to be passed to the bureau of members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martines, to a training school esplanate, where his family, including his daughter, Amanda and his wife, Christina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers, were already waiting.
Three bodies found abandoned in the NL farm of Kaderajt
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed 11 people in the media who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found killed in various parts of the body with a fire fired on a abandoned farm in the Kaderajta Himanes municipality, Nuevo Leon.
The invention was discovered at 1.5 miles of the Caderajt road to Santiago, the highest communities known as El Castillo.
A number of people who passed past noticed that the village house, whose wall was decorated in a brown, was opened.
When they looked inside, literally in three meters, they discovered the bodies of three people, they immediately informed the authorities concerned.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow black jeans, without shoes, and there was another man in a white shirt next to him.
Almost in one meter there was a body of another person, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying down.
According to the testimony collected there, three people were killed elsewhere, since there were no boats.
There are signs addressed to one organized criminal group in the village house, and there are several holes from bullets in the gate.
11 Captured in Kaderite
The Ministry of National Security represented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that acted mainly in the Kaderajt municipality, and who were accused of abduction, murders, " fraud" and secret burying.
According to the information published, eight persons were detained in the Los Alvero colony at first on 11 November, and one hostage person was saved.
They were provided by three houses and phones, demanding to be members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another event happened on November 12th, at 6:00 a.m., the military personnel took a patrol to the village of Old Rancho in Kadereate, when he saw a car without numbers with two men in the room.
By suspending them and conducting an inspection, the military found a gun, a bullet and 18 bullets.
Later, after these statements, on 14 November, one of their associates was suspended in the public land of La True, which, after seeing the military, tried to escape.
He was accused of secret funerals in the municipalities of Héneral Terran, Hina and Kaderajt.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce a new Government that will face the crisis that puts the country on the edge of the economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday, to introduce a new government that will face the crisis that has put Italy on the edge of the economic disaster and the damage to the whole eurozone.
The statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President George Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected to represent the office mostly of the technocrats, although it is unacceptable when the new executive authority takes its positions.
Monty said that he would present to the President the results of his political negotiations with the political parties in its attempt to form a Government.
"I wish to reaffirm my full confidence in the ability of our country to get out of this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner to the reporters.
Monty did not say directly that he was able to form the Government, but the tone of his comments showed that obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well shaded," he said.
Monty has completed the Government ' s formation process in less than three days, which is much less common, since Italy has struggled with the political and financial crisis, which has made their debt to the critical level
The administration under the leadership of the former European Commissioner, Monty, should approve the hard savings package required by the European leaders to restore their confidence in Italy.
Based on Monty's pressure to accelerate, unstable markets have established income from the BTP bonds of Italy for 10 years over 7 per cent, where Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Labour Federation, informed the reporters after the meeting with Monty, "We said that we would actively support this government."
We believe that this Government is the last chance of Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances for success were based on the support of the LDC, Sylvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monty must lead to a good outcome," said Angelino Alphano, Secretary of the Central Right Party, reporters.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important, because so far many of its members have opposed the Government's majority of the technokrats that form Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that will likely be unpopular reforms of a severe economy.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts can lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Foreign Bank Association increased pressure, warning that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups on Monday, as well as with adolescent and female organizations.
He'll finish his meetings on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, which allowed a very rapid transition to respond to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of the last week, when it was clear that Berluscony would resign, Italy's debt cost has now reached a critical level of uncertainty about whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern financial defenders of the eurozone.
Monty said that his Government would exist before the following elections for 2013, despite the widespread forecasts, that policies would only give him time to reform before appointing new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insisted that it should be composed only of technical experts, as evidence of their displeasure by the impact of the financial situation on the process.
Political sources reported that mutual disagreement and disagreement of parties complicated the attempt to integrate political figures.
The Spanish have more game experience than Ticos
Of 22 players stated in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 claimed players played 50 matches.
Little contrast with Costa Rica, if compared 22 players caused by both countries to communicative match today at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San Jos.
While the world champions and Europe, number one in the FIFA monthly rating, have a full list of selection games in class A, Tricolor has only a protector of Michael Uman as the only one who has performed 50 international games.
This number was achieved last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommmel Fernandes stadium.
The Spanish football players played in the League of All Stars and In the Power Clubs of the Premier League of England have been very active in the League and local cup competitions, and they are high-level players in the European cups and the League of Champions.
The experience of the Spanish Furia in the complicated qualifications in the Euro or the World Championship should be added.
However, Ticos players have limited international experience in a zone like CONKAKAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the list is headed by the Spanish Icker Cassillias Collective, who last week against England (the 0-1 game in London) repeated the record of the ex-holkeeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Cassillias will play against Tricolor today and set up a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Ernandez, Barcelona player, 106 matches.
Cassillas and Javi were recognized as the best last week of UEFA, along with another Iberian team player, Subisareta, with 126 matches and bomber Shalke Raul Gonzales with 102.
It's nearly coming to a hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Javi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres, from 90, David Willy and Serhio Ramos, both of 81, Andres Injesta, 62, Sesk Fabregas, 61 and David Silva 53.
By Costa Rica, next to Michael Umana, the left side of Junior Diaz, with 48 matches and the bomber Brian Ruis, from 45.
Furthermore, only five have overcome abroad in 30 games: Calor Navas from 31, Randall Asofaifa of 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Louis Lopez 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain at Gerar Pike (37), Serhio Buskets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
Roy Miller, with 26 matches, Winston Parks, 26, Gabriel Badilla, with 25 and Roy Muri of 23.
The rest didn't even get up to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, and Hordy Alba is two, Victor Bolivar has only one in Costa Rica, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
The leading Spanish player David Willia with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres, 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruis became the one who brought more scores twice as Carlos Hernandez and three times more than Roy Muri and Parks.
Kwintet included the country in a tour of the 20th-year career
The journey to Costa Rica is a dream that is fulfilled.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, the Basist Jeff Amment from Pearl Jam said that the group was ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There was more than 20 years of expectation, but the group said that it was also a real dream to play in this country.
This was the statement of the Basist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The Panel is in South America as part of a tour of the twentieth year of work and on Sunday, 20 numbers, will take its only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will speak at the National Stadium from 7:30 a.m. with the L.A. team of the X and the local group of Las Robertas.
This is a part of a conversation that is fully decrypted online in the Nation.
For your Costa Rica fans, this is the dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
The journey to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us, too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's going well.
I was in Costa Rica only once -- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask that because there is some loyalty to the group; the fans live in tense days before the concert.
What do you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
We took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry that it took us so much time to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, view it as the greatest show of the year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we played in the past 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We had a few great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that it brought us into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle, about these two things, Costa Rica, one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her surfing waves?
We have a lot of cheerleader friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves are amazing here.
My friends always drive surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and Mexico, these are excellent places for surfing, that's how we learned, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you could say you've done great shows with a lot of songs.
What have you planned to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to make the best show of the most possible songs; we'll try to play a few songs from each album and give our fans a great variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think that's partly because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose what songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in a tone and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and what we could forget.
This makes the show more interesting for us, so I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour is 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think none of us could ever imagine we're in a rock group and that we've been doing this for over 20 years, makes it look like a dream.
We are happy for our happiness and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and we like to make music.
We are happy to ride around the world where we always wanted to go.
It's all very good for us.
What does it mean to you to be a significant part of the grange flower?
It was always an honour to be part of this group of great collectives.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows from a group of friends, and it's unusual.
From time to time, one group of the same city appears, but much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud of being part of the Seattle team.
I'm still playing with some of them.
Last year we were with Alice in Chains, and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we are happy to be friends with all of them and for us the honor to be part of the sound of Seattle that came up.
It is also very strange that a group like yours remains together and in the same composition for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer than many groups exist.
First of all, I think we're lucky that we're still alive, and secondly, we're taking care of others.
We are all very close friends, and so we have also opened musical roads that give each one the freedom of experiment.
We trust music each other, and it could not be better.
Your attitude to the word of glory was difficult, but thanks to your success, you could do whatever you wanted.
How do you find the balance?
When we grew up, it was easier to find a balance.
We take care of not being too long in the tour, because it's easy to get into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people here for music, it reminds you that you must respect music and what has done, without deciding to be a celebrity and being a rock star, what none of us cares about.
What kind of other project do you remember, Manother Love Bone?
I think we write really good songs and at first it was great.
We were a group for almost three years, and we haven't released any album until Andrew Woods died.
There was a lot of disappointment because it lasted so long and the most important thing that we were still close friends with Bruce (Fervezer) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photograph, I think about the amazing man who was Andy, and as he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh, to talk about music and football and a lot of friends.
He was a great man, and we miss him.
The local group of Las Robertas will be responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Weedder, and that's why you chose it to open?
Yes, the producers sent us a few video proposals, and this was a group that we liked most of all, so we are looking forward to seeing Las Robertas can offer a live one, and that must be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing words at Yellow Ledbetter at the concerts?
That's the question for Ed, Eddie Wadder, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he's using the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
So many of them.
Among the first ones who come to mind, Giser Butler, John Antwisle, CJ Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They're so many that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the grange, despite his fashion?
I think we all feel some distraction from the word grange.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the groups I've mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all who appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful because it's music that's worth listening, and the teams like Mudhoney are now making music better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How will you explain this change?
That's interesting, because I think there are some songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are considered very dark, though they can sound a little positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs were very dark.
I think when you grow up and you've had some trauma in your life and you've lost a family member or a friend, these events start to affect your art and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect this for me.
So, I think you can be a happy man and still know how to create dark music.
Peru:
Fuchimori was again hospitalized for medical surveys
The Ex-President Alberto Fuchimori was hospitalized on Tuesday to the State Hospital to survey the loss of muscle force observed in his feet, his family doctor.
Fuhimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years of prison for violations of human rights committed during its rule (1990-2000), suffered from several diseases, including the language cancer, which had been surged four times and was observed.
Congressman Alejandro Aginoga, who is his personal doctor, told the N TV channel that Fuhimori would be surveyed in three days at the National Institute for Neoplastic Diseases in order to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower ends.
Aginoga said that he believed that Fuhimori had to be a candidate for the benefit of mercy from humanitarian reasons; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He carried four tongue cancer operations, lost 18 pounds weight, and other diseases, such as a strong erosive gastrite, iron fists, renal stones, high blood pressure and bloodcycle problems, reported by the doctor.
Fuchimori is in prison since September 2007, in the National Special Operations Office.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for murder of 25 people by the army destruction team that had been secretly acting in the first years of his rule.
Muhika is sent to Mexico to strengthen political relations
The official delegation, headed by President Uruguay José Muhiko, and consisting of several ministers and businessmen, will arrive on Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political issues of the region.
Muhika will meet in the next Wednesday with its Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important point of the comprehensive plan of meeting with political, commercial authorities and meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the schedule published by Uruguay leadership.
The meeting of two presidents in Guadalahara would be " a favourable exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations", as published by the South American country ' s leadership on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking support for Calderon for Uruguay in the incident with France, which happened when the French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a letter of taxation at the G20 meeting in the French town of Canne.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries remaining tax ports, a statement that had caused the protest of Uruguay and its ambassador ' s consultations in the European country.
Mexico has been chaired since November in G20, a group created from the most developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, with the South American country since January this year, a tax exchange agreement to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has been trying to accelerate the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in recent years in order to leave this " gray list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, composed of countries that do not use international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the Trade Plan, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 the Free Trade Agreement (STS), which has increased the goods between the two countries.
The aquaculture will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought persistently for more than 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the evil foot of Bouser, but he never did this before in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in the shops around the world this month, has been created in light of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows the three dimensions to play without the need for scores.
"Mario is a hero who should report how the stereoscopy will work without scores," said Nintendo Press Head in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specially developed under this platform", because the successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have so far been adapted to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo stated that, despite the existence of the 3D, the Super Mario 3D Land is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
One day, most of the experts will go in the second round to the game levels that are more complex this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or the one that only affects the depth of action, but which needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and "do not subject to optical illusions".
This intrusion of Super Mario in three dimensions also means the return of the hero to a portative console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo blinks the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, the waterkeeper with the waxes must go through dangerous minered platforms to release princess Pitch.
However, the player will find new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the "player" of Louisi.
The Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said Tuesday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portillo began to respond in the United States for the washing conspiracy of $70 million.
This is the end of the process on which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which required the extradition of Portillo to judge him there.
At the press conference, Colom said that his decision was related to the independence of the judicial and executive authorities, taking into account that the first instance had already signed an extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate he had not “incorporated his hands” to legal decisions and had taken all extradition procedures that he had ever known.
Together with Portillo Serhio Ruano Marrokin, he will be extradicated for murder and severe body damage, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drugs.
What was done by Colom showed the executive process after all legal and constitutional courts were exhausted in order to persecute the former head of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CSC), Portillo will be extradicated once, with a decision on its legal situation in Guatemala and the guarantee of its human rights.
Portillo was recognized innocent in the expense of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Relations filed appeals and reopened the case.
Triniova helped 6,000 young people from the risk group
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The outcomes of the first 25 years of the Triniova Social Support Organization were important: 6,000 young people under social isolation have helped to overcome the complex situations during this fourth century.
More than hundreds of jobs created for this social group should be added to this.
The anniversary served as a result of the ceremony held in the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people came.
Triniev arrived next to Trinitat Velja in 1986 in order to help young people with lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or marginalization.
The Saint Andreu celebration yesterday gathered a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that cooperated with the association during these 25 years.
Different political representation during elections showed a single nature of Triniova ' s work.
After the President of the General, Arthur Mass and his predecessor, Hordy Tumor, the ceremony was visited by the former Socialist Education Consultant, Ernest Maragal, and former mayor and current eco-socialist, member of the Municipal Council, Rickard Goma.
The current social welfare advisor, Josép Lewis Claris and the SEC on La Caixa, Howard Lanaspa, also appeared in Fabra I Coats.
He said that Trinius had come into light at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but he added that the work done so far was "good base".
The President introduced Trinius as an example of the fight against the bad circumstances and the inclusion of hope in people who have difficulties.
"The crisis is not new for the organization and work it has done," he said.
The captured building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated
Contributors occupied 11 out of 13 floors of the building in Balmes Street, 51
12 occupants left the building yesterday noon.
It seems that the nightmare experienced by neighbors living in a house of 51 on the street of Balmes came to an end.
Twelve people volunteered yesterday at noon to leave the building which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that irritated the neighbours in order of a court without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the castle was replaced to prevent the repeatation of the situation.
"From now there will be passage control," said the manager.
The squatters that took 11 of the 13th floors of the building, the others inhabited, all electricity and part of the water, drew walls and left traces of different kinds, especially the banks of alcoholic drinks.
The first three floors were a field for mass parties, which lasted up to two days and irritated owners.
A nightclub, Balmes 51, was also damaged behind the building.
The Master, Maria Pantinate, reported that since the building was occupied, its income decreased by 80 per cent.
The owner of the club said that the captains of the building put her in an unfair competition, since they were selling drinks for three euros, while in the 10th club.
Furthermore, the discotec owner had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors to noise, although she noted that noise was caused not by the club but by the residents of the quota and, first of all, to those who attended the parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as said the angry neighbors.
The master of the club said that the uncomfortableness was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months he "forgived" her rental.
The city police also confirmed that more complaints had been received from neighbours over the past weeks.
The Chairman of the Municipal Group, Alberto Fernand Diaz, requested last week " to evacuate the building immediately in order to address the problems of coexistence and the general spirit of the neighbours and degradation in that area."
The popular leader explained that only one floor of the building was busy until summer, but in the last few months, the squatters invaded all floors and almost every room and that some of them had been invading.
In this sense, he added that “is a need to end impunity and resist the non-cultural activity in the building”.
So yesterday the police evacuated the building in Noah Barris.
At 15:30, the police left the street of Montrall, 35 after they received a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or the forest?
The architects agree with the possibility of a competition after the debate on contributions
The municipal competition for 16 doors renewed the role of Kolserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the rise of the capital corporation of Barcelona (CCC), the administration printed promo lists for Kolserola.
The bullet described the mountain as a large park of Barcelona.
Furthermore, this was accompanied by comparison in pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CCB, in 1987, the park took place again in awareness of many as Barcelona's high point as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few who were oriented not north-south but up (hole) down (sea).
Calserola's position as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but the Yellowstone, with a wild cab as a bear of Yogy.
It was so until, in September, the Council announced huge competitions of 16 competitions to many other gates in Kolserol.
The idea of the park is under the gate, of course.
Either so, or someone wants to put the gates on the field.
The question is, Calserola, or a park or a mountain?
The competitions and their organizational side and their influence on the city are a subject to discussing all Barcelona architects.
This is not the most repeating topic discussed when two members of the clan of the elected people recognize each other in the elevator.
And this is one of the few coincidences between the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastal line, it has become "necessary" to discuss "the front of the mountain", when the proposal of Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"We must assume that the largest park of Barcelona is the beach.
Besides, thanks to his excellent availability.
Calserol is more complex," says the architect for whom the "gate of the Colcerola" contains a "fare trap," we should not think of them as "a way into the park, but as a limitation of certain areas where we should act."
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayona with experience in urban construction, called the proposal "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
Risks resulting in "indetermination of public space forecasting" after experience in the 1980s, which ended at the Forum ' s "s swan songs".
The first fear is the own limitation of the borders where it can be built.
"The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step," is meant to move.
"We must think of new urban planning tools, because the current [specific to the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to real trouble."
More closer to the case, Modolo believes that simplification of the valley of Kolserola "can be seen as a park, Barcelona and not" as a purely topographic question.
The Modolo recalls that there is already a work done outside Calserola, which should not be "omitted by ears", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers to his profession, to enter this project "from the beginning".
Moreover, it understands that the closeness of the mountain to the city is a passage that allows the architects to enter into the debate, but "he doubts" that this technical profile should be the one that should lead inter-disciplinary teams "a success," he claims, which should have created "Architects should be only a tool."
Bayona suggests that the question that asks the name of this part is complex, since the rules of the competition lack the general type of Colcerola: "It has been declared 16 crossing competitions," he said, "for the purpose of the sea-hore, but there is no long reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This forces, at least in his case, to decide on 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one gate may be crossed by programme and definition with the architect project for the neighbouring gates.
In your view, the Council must guarantee that the belt should be directly over Rhonda de Dalt in full, equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
Following 72 days of the settlement, the Judiciary of Red Casino forgived the Mayor Monterrey's brother in the process against him in charge of expulsion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be free after the Legislative Representative of Red Casino has given him forgiveness to the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting the expulsion process against Mayor Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale bomb, the owner of the Red Casino, Serhio Gil Garcia, published a series of photographs and videos where Manuel Jonas, apparently, demanded him to pay his economic contribution so that the authorities of Monterrey would authorize a secret operation in the game house.
After public conviction, the State Prosecutor opened a criminal case against the Mayor's brother, and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old capital of the State.
It remained there for 49 days following the second order to prohibit the movement after the prosecutor dismissed crimes and organized crime.
He was transferred to Kaderajt on 19 October for the expulsion of half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with the average degree of imprisonment because he was threatened by death.
The authorities allowed him to continue to stay in municipal prison in San Nicholas, Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second District Court, Jorge Janez, who said that after nearly two months of investigations, Jonas was proof of guilt, such as taking 1,5 million pesos with bookkers in exchange for the authorisation of the operation.
On Monday, the Legislative Representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, was presented before Judge Jose Luis Pesina to request pardon for the Mayor of the region, so he could receive freedom in the next hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomes whether he had repaid damage and who of the partners in the game house had given mercy, although the lawyer tried not to give a name.
Based on record 197/2011, the legal pardon was given to Jonas Larrasabal, and thereafter no statements on the process planned against him; no repayment of damage and punishment would be required.
After the hearing of a legitimate booking representative, nearly at 15:50, it was ordered to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
The servant of the court, Jorge Janese, went to the San Nicholas Municipality in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate order for the release signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Peres Hakome tells about the details of the disaster where the Minister of Interior, Francisco Blake, died, and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (ICT) reported that the results obtained in an accident, during which the Minister of Interior Francesco Blake Mora and seven other people died, showed that the helicopter had hit the ground directly in full state of complete integrity without attempting the pilot to make an emergency landing.
During the press conference, Dionysio Peres Hacome, the Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft rose up, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"The elements that appear to show that the vessel had several contacts with the ground have been contacted with the trees at 25 meters where the tool was lost."
He also reported that the ship was designated for 19 persons, respectively, in accordance with the necessary human transport requirements.
He also said that studies conducted in the area of strike did not report on the existence of parts on the earth.
"The study reports that there are no vessel components elsewhere, and the structural integrity has occurred.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, which satisfied the relevant requirements for passenger transport.
The earth in this place has a displacement from seven to 30 degrees.
At this point, the Secretary said, it is essential to obtain results as soon as possible; however, the study may take a few months or even one year.
In the meantime, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the hit, the presidential helicopter was managed at cream speed and that this happened on softly rising ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of the normal summer maneuver at the time of the strike," he said.
At the press conference, the SCT owner, Perez Hakome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the airline rules, the flight was carried out under the rules of visual flight, which means that the team should be visible during the flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports revealed suitable conditions for a flight when the aircraft was heading to the border territory between Mexico and the State of Mexico, where clouds were observed at low heights.
Selected routes:
It is possible that, due to cloud conditions, the team was looking for a lower height zone and more apparent in the Quernawac Valley.
It's a place of strike.
The coordinates of the strike and the latest recording of the aircraft radar match, probably before the hit was lost control or change in the direction of the flight.
Distribution of fractures in a small area:
The information available still indicates that the strike occurred on the front and side line.
The fracture of the fractures makes it clear that the helicopter struck the ground under the structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion have been found:
The disaster area remains undetected evidence in the fractures of the ship, some sort of explosion or fire.
The recent studies show that there could be multiple contacts with the land.
During work at the site, sea level 9.200 feet above the aircraft were found, and the land was declined from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The painting shows the sequence in which it was destroyed on the road.
Information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have had several collisions with the ground.
After a thorough study in a larger area than the outlined zone near the scene of the disaster, no parts of the aircraft were found to be displaced, which strengthens the assumption that the struggle had occurred under the structural integrity.
MSS announces a programme of search for fatty genes
Social protection is headed by a study on the search for abnormality genes for children and young people; it is supported by IPN experts
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSI) announced that it was conducting a study in order to detect a gene of abnormality in children and young people, which was entitled “Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescent age”, which would provide a number of signs related to excessive weight.
In his statement, the Head of the Medical Studies Division for Biochemicals of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 21st century Miguel Cruise Lopez explained that a multi-profile team of therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers was gathered.
The team is assisted by experts and asspirators of the National Institute for Health of Nation (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Political Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (subscribed or not) is invited to participate in the MSSI sports centres, which participate in the study, in the Mexico Valley, where Saturday, since 8 a.m., tests will be conducted with children.
He emphasized that the protocol was launched in the Sports Centre in Quautemoka (West of Mexico), and since 8 October, it was held in the sports center in Nesaualcoitle (East of Mexico).
Following the goal of attraction between 500 and 600 children, the study will continue in the sports center Independence (South Mexico) and finally in the Morelos sports centre (Northern Mexico).
He explained that the aim of this study was to understand the elements and importance of genetic development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases
The World Diabetes Day will be observed on 14 November, and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adolescents aged between 6 and 14 years from parents' permission and under their care to fill individual food surveys.
They will also be asked about physical activity and history of family inheritance diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney inadequacy.
He explained that anthropometric dimensions of all participants (wes, growth and scope of talia), blood pressure measurement and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genes associated with child density).
Cruise Lopez said that this study reflects the concern of health professionals about the anxious increase in the weight of children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicated that growth had occurred only in six years: 77 per cent of the boys suffered from fatty, 47 per cent in the case of girls; with regard to overweight, there was also significant growth," said MSI specialist.
He said that the foundation of the search for markers was based on the fact that the population of the country was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican was 65 per cent of the descendants of the American Indians, 30 per cent of the European descendants and five per cent of the African descendants, and that was affected by genes associated with diabetes and excessive weight.
He explained that mainly the result of obesity is the failure of the body to burn the excess of the energy we consume (calories) and it is delayed as fat.
The researcher explained that a direct benefit for the participants was a comprehensive assessment of children that could detect whether they had any excessive weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the existence of dark brackets on the neck (accants) and the pre-flags means the probability of a violation of metabolism and even a prediabette.
The physicians are being treated with all confidentiality, transmitted in writing to their parents, explaining all the dimensions and changes in their lifestyle that must be taken to avoid diseases.
Cruise Lopez explained that there are three main reasons for excessive weight, fatty and other chronic diseases: seating lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, having a majority of the day before the TV and using transport on small distances instead of walking.
It is also due to the high consumption of calories, i.e. the increase in the use of sweet drinks and carbons (tam, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with large contents of fats and proteins and the genetic predisposure analysed in the programme.
UNAM Asfalt will be able to avoid cracks
Raphael Errera, a researcher of the UNAM Chemical Faculty, developed a polymer modified bitum to produce a mixture of best quality, sustainable to environmental and temperature impact.
If the road covering signals were given attention, there would be about 200 thousand jams to be repaired for each rain season in the capital area in the Mexico Valley, said Rafael Errera Nahera, a researcher of the UNAM Chemical Faculty, and added that if the process of construction and content of the asfalted road coverage was correct, the number of pits could be reduced or totally declined to zero.
In his lecture, the Technological view of pits read within the International Year of Chemicals reports that the laboratory for which it is responsible is developing a polymer modified bitum for the production of a mixture with the characteristics close to the bitum but with the best resistance of both high and low temperatures.
Errera Nahera said that this type of modified bitum could be used in places where weather is extremely hot, as in some northern cities, to improve the quality of roads and therefore the opposition to the education of pits.
He explained that the bitum, the most difficult part of oil, is the sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, one of which is the high molecular mass called asfaltens, and the other is a low molecular mass called Maltens, which together accompanies the road coverage of its characteristics of the collateral behaviour.
The bitum's vigorous behaviour is the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it acts like liquid, at 120 degrees high, and at 50 degrees to Celsia, it remains almost firm, while at very low temperatures, the bitum becomes thick, he said.
This means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not permanent, but is changing during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperatures, said the chemical engineering expert.
Hemfaca scientist noted that Mexico streets were mainly covered with flexible coverage, consisting of six layers of material, of which three of the latter included a bitum.
Among the top layers is the bitum composed of small stones dropped into the bitum and then sponsored.
Each stone that was covered, he said it was floated into a bitum.
In the movement of vehicles and efforts, this helps the forces to be very well distributed by road coverage.
If it was a modified asphalt, they would have been even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
At the asphalt cover, he added, the last layer, which is called a layer of export, made of small stone, was actually a sand floated into the asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact transport wheels, it must have more resistance than asphaltic coverage and road training.
As part of the road coverage that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the export layer also requires adequate thickness and must be taken into account the material from which it is produced.
Weather, especially wetness and temperature declines, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it has significant impact on the state of asphalt.
When the ground is raw, the water enters into coverage and it is difficult to get out of there, this causes mitigation of all layers of covering and, therefore, the education of pits.
In the formation of james, he said, the first is the export layer and only then affects the bitum, but the damage does not occur instantly, which should be given attention to the first signs of the current repair programmes.
Furthermore, a member of the National Research System explained that transport load was another important factor in the development of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of covering must always be linked to transport loads and that requires guaranteed compliance with this requirement in order to prevent the frequent appearance of holes.
Rafael Errera said that about the bitum, many remain to be studied and done, for example, by bitum emulsions that have already been marketed in other countries, and even helped to manage holes easily and without using high temperatures.
What was not enough for the Valie candidate to become the new Miss of Colombia?
Analysis of the reasons that hindered Serna Meline Ramirez to receive Miss Colombia's crown.
The representative of Valie received the title of the princess 14 times.
The next time Valje del Cauca is only to wish to receive Miss Colombia's crown.
This time, Melina Ramires Serna had to be satisfied with the winners with a silver crown and a tape proclaiming her new princess of Colombia.
In view of the outcome reached last night in Cartachen, where the Miss Atlantic won the crown and skipetr, the Department counts 14 titled princess, and Melina joins the Legion of Women from Valie del Cauca, who were close to the crown, but were declared by princess, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Laurena Alvares (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blanke (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonswella Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hisey Alhures (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stephanie Harse Alhure (1989).
A question that is now asked by many:
Because it was the result of the defeat of the main favorite who in each of the speeches showed that she had everything to become the new Miss of Colombia, she was not just elected by the Queen of the Police and the most beautiful person in the version of Vogue -- the titles of the queens, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor in the jury's decision to condemn the title of the First Princess was that she was unable to convincingly answer the question "What book characterizes you and why?", asked by Martin Murille Gomez from the literary society, let us read.
She replied to the questionnaire:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of occultation, and I definitely think that the book that characterizes my childhood is a pretty deep book.
Today I read the Crime and Punishment, which is a remembrance of world literature that we should all read; I also read the book of Irina Nemirova, Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Blood Heat".
Answer that did not like the jury because of the term “oculture” and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically as each of the quoted books characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and satisfied with her result, "the universe is wise, what should happen."
And, please read a little, "Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the sound hypotheses, Valje burned from favorites.
The Bogota reporter assumed that since she was preferred, she was a candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (coulinary competition of Ostera, a vision for the best national suit, and the Queen of Mother), "which raised the jealousy of other candidates, caused the queen's stress, and as a result, she did not shine on the scene."
And it was marked during her first appearance in a bathing beach at Hilton and during two her shows at the evening crown.
Although it seemed confident in both of them, it was noted that she lacked the strength and energy that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was called the princess " means that a candidate who wins more awards during the competition does not become a queen."
Furthermore, the representative of Valier has recently avoided communication with the press, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valie failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is, eventually, the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election, a member of the international jury, Lucy Doti, said that they were looking for a woman committed to their country's social needs.
"One beauty is not enough for Ms. Colombia, we must not only look at the appearance but also focus on public consciousness, before they take part in the competition, they should already be involved in projects," she said.
It is also suggested that the representative of Valier had sinned with defects on her belly and fibrosis, which was seen on her belly, but was disputed, since the jury had noted her as a "natural beauty" candidate, taking into account her healthier body, good food and responsibilities of physical work.
The advisor of Queen Jorge Ernan Orosco notes that Melina had not the best body that had better, "but the problems of fibrosis on my stomach, which were not very noticeable for me, have made her lose her glasses on the last day."
In the meantime, Guido Oyos, journalist of Cromos, believes that the error of the representative of Valje de Kauka was that she was subjected to surgery.
"Operations are good, but Valier's representative doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize, which was first delivered by the National Beauty Competition, the cruel prophecy took place last night, said that it was a child that Raimundo gave Melina as compensation for the loss of the pleasure of receiving the crown.
So whether it is or not, the fact that Melina has a year of rule today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that enables her to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions identified directly by the National Competition Organizers.
However, it will enter history as one of the queens, who, despite its excellent contest in Cartachen, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
Criminalist from Kali came into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these servants is key.
On 4 November, CTI Kali's criminalist came into history as a person who confirmed the identity of FARC Alfonso Kano to compare his fingerprints.
Seven of the CTI criminals this week came in the queue to " prosecute" Eliza Gonzales, a man from Puerto Tehad, who spent 21 year in the field of trial.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzales worked in cities of Choco, where he often had to walk over five days through the jungle to reach the places where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valie and after the completion of the relevant courses, he became a criminal specialist where he studied skin training, i.e. hands and walls.
During the week of Elizara's identification operation, known as Alfonso Kano, he was told to take clothes for no more than three days.
Something big is coming.
On Friday night, he arrived on a helicopter from Kauka to Palmir.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to a man who was head of the world's older party war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of Guillermo Leon Saens' prints.
However, when he arrived with the research group to the place where the body was located, he did not identify it in an external form; he was very different from the media.
He was without a beard, dressed as a local farmer, without scores and much worse.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Using an increase in glass, ink, shovel, and lamp, Elizar compared the body's fingerprints with those on the photos.
His eyes weren't disappointed: it was Alfonso Kano.
The same night, the representative of Puerto Texas requested confirmation by the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinson, that he was the head of the RSCC
Search for fingerprints
The recognition received by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliza Gonzales at the press conference on the operation against Cano was particularly important for a dactylscope professional in the area of the Sijin Division of Kali.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactylscopy is a strict science, without mistakes, it can play a key role in the discovery of crimes.
In addition to the identification of bodies, Dactyloscopy professionals participate in the investigation of crimes such as stealing and murder, and establish the identity of the detainees.
In detention, many criminals have fake certificates or have no documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the base.
The researcher said that in the case of stealing, he had to take a piece of wall at home because the thief was resisting his hands to possess a safe full of jewelry and money.
"It is hard to work with the walls because they are not suitable for printing, but in that case we can take a picture of the entire arm and establish the identity of a criminal who participated in several stealing," he said.
The prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man was recently found with bottles of liquor around him.
During the investigation, a relative could have been suspected in the crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle were coincided.
Although it doesn't guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves he was at the murder scene.
The CTI Dactyloscope specialist explained that a chemical or physical reaction is carried out in places where there are fingerprints.
When they appear, a shovel or a tape is used to remove them.
After that, prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or are registered.
"The problem is that we still have many undocumented colombians," said CTI expert.
He explained that it was not the way it was shown in the CSI TV.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves fingerprints.
However, if possible, the comparison is made.
"Angered People" challenge New York authorities
A hundred protesters broke the camp before the Zukcotti Square.
Part of the protesters heard the court's decision to prosecute a demonstration from the square and went to the neighbourhood park.
The members of the Wall Street Movement evacuated the New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to invade again, under the protection of a court order, to the Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated at sunrise when attempting to capture another park of Great Apple.
There were hundreds of protesters copied at the Zukotti Square, where they wanted to go through a judicial order that allowed the " angry people" to break the camp on the square, while the other part of the movement responded to the circulation by captureing the park in the north of the city where further arrests were held
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to break the camp on the square, we will break the camp somewhere else and continue the trial for return to Zukotti and through peaceful strikes and demonstration," said one of the representatives of the Wall Street Movement, Mark Bray.
Brey explained that the reply of " angry people" to the evacuation of the Chamber City, which was given by mayor of New York by Michael Bloomberg, entered court where Judge Lucy Billings had issued a decision prohibiting violent evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, the “angered people” came to the capture of a new park located in the centre streets of Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the Church of Trinity.
At least an hour they could take this place, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the protestants, although Brey could not specify the exact number, but told Efe that he saw several journalists who were also in lips.
The Organization assures that several hundred people were standing with tents in the place where the delegation of religious leaders went to show support to the members of the movement, trying to speak as a mediator in negotiations with the police.
In the meantime, the Zukotti area, which is a private property, remains closed to the expectation of a hearing appointed on Tuesday, which will address the legality of the prosecutors ' prosecution today.
Some of the protesters who were heading there were carrying and disseminating copies of that judicial order at the same time, and even gave these copys to police guarding the area, which led to " some small collisions", said Brey, who stated that some police were beating demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to evacuate members of the Wall Street Movement and to force " laws issued after the start of the capture, or to prohibit the demonstrators from getting access again to the park with shops and other property used earlier".
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that the city had suspended the opening of public space because of this judgment, and the demonstrators had been informed, but local laws prevented them from reopening chamber shops and bedroom bags.
The Municipal Council had personally justified the removal of the protesters from the Zukotti area in the morning, an operation during which approximately 200 arrests were committed, and the decision was taken because the protesters had "violated the law " .
Bloomberg said that he had given order to clean up the area because it was a "place where people had come not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others", since "some businesses had been threatened" and the neighbors feared "for the deterioration of the quality of life".
The evacuation of this morning was disgusting and showed that the Bloomberg soul was more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” added the representative of the movement that condemned the mayor ' s " disrespect for freedom of speech " .
The " Wall Street Captures " also indicated that they intend to organize " grand shares" on Thursday, in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions, to remember the last two months of the protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will become Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Buble and other extraordinary Canadians, it will be presented in the " Russell Peters Christmas" program on 1 December.
A Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Biggest Restaurant", a rescue agent in the "Spassers of Malibu", Banny in Playboy, a rock musician wife, Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian TV.
The private TV TV announced today that Anderson, along with the coroner (producer of the ballades) Michael Buble and other extraordinary Canadians, would be presented in the Russell Peters Christmas program on 1 December, in the role of a very special Mary.
The CCTV presented today television videos, in which Anderson, also known by the widespread online home pornography video, was presented with her husband, Tommy Crüe group, who was dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll in the jasles of Jesus' image.
In this stage, Peters, a famous Canadian comic of Indian origin, who recently acted as a leader in the tour of "My cruel torpedo of truth" Charlie Shina, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian singer of Bubli participates in a special Christmas show, who was married in Buenos Aires at the Argentine model, Louisian Lopilato, and who also knows the scandals.
Recently, Buble called America's "bitch" Kim Cardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan recovered after the earthquake
GDP increased by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and ended the falling lane that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and has still been recovered from the destructive earthquake caused by the nuclear crisis, the most scary disaster that the country of the sun since World War II had been transferred
According to the first estimates of the Government of Tokyo, material losses amounted to $300,000 million -- an impact that seemed to pass despite the difficult world situation.
After the three loss blocks, data on gross domestic product from July to September definitely helped to turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent in the annual calculation.
The second quarter registered - for the Japanese financial year begins in March 2012 - also highlights the rapidest growth rates from January to March 2010.
Renaissance can be partially explained by renewing the purchase of machine equipment for the recovery of areas devastated by earthquakes and after tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against 0.9 per cent of capital costs observed since January to March, the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real fracture in the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keinsian impulse, which calls for a crisis of strengthening - or restructuring - infrastructure using lies to grow from zero.
Japan awakes, mainly through the development of domestic consumption, which is now 60 per cent of the Japanese GDP.
This rate increased by 1% by increased costs on cars, travels and rest.
Cleimo of Yen
Tokyo provided the internal market when Yena, a Japanese currency, became one of the currencies of asylum, elected by investors who wanted to get rid of the euro debt crisis and negative forecasts on the United States, the privilege that puts the privilege as a stone on the account of exporting companies.
In a stronger currency, the product is expensively abroad, which is a serious impact for the country whose economic course is defined by the health of large technological companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame yen for their low indicators from July to September.
As long as the markets continue to be situated in the EU peripheral countries, the Government of Esichico Noda does not reduce caution.
We should be careful of the continuing risks such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flood in Thailand and the rapid increase in yena, said yesterday the Minister for Economic Policy of Motohis Furukawa.
Indeed, the prospects are not exciting.
The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries demonstrated in September the apparent signs of the decline in economic activity.
The indicator foretold the breakdowns in the world economy has shown that the major forces are slowing down.
Then it fell by four tenth to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even fallen below the average of 100 points, after it crashed at eight tenth to 99.13.
Athens again give soil to doubt
Papademos said that correction would be approved, but the conservators would not sign any written obligation
With the peripheral risk and uncertainty prizes in the parks, Greece continues to blur on the labyrinth, which leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “agreement” of the new transitional Government of Ellada is more imposed by Brussels's requirements than by the true belief of political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos yesterday warned that alternatives to structural reforms were not available and that the stand-day period agreed with its appointment may be insufficient for their application, the leader of the Conservative Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new strict savings in any case and reiterate his demand for new elections assigned on 19 February.
The Government ' s main task is to meet the decisions taken at the Summit of 26 October, said Papademos yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will be met tomorrow with the confidence of the new executive authority.
The 24-increased employment package, the disciplinary code of public officials and new measures to combat tax removal will be the first innovation.
However, the message of Samaras does not clarify doubts about his position: "We are ready to help the transitional Government, but we do not promise anything."
The Conservatory Leader made a step more in his moods regarding the EU and the IMF, organizations that should freeze 8,000 millions of the Athens urgently needed, and explained that he would not grant its approval to a letter of agreement with the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect caused by the statements of the referendum of Papandreo, repeated yesterday that its requirements were unanimous: it would not resume assistance if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties did not sign "written agreement without any misunderstanding and as soon as possible".
The representative of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafai, said that three inspectors could " very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new Government "which must be made to pay the sixth tranch" of 8,000 million, although the exact date is not yet marked.
In the Greek club, there are enough threads for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: " These are tools for progress and hope."
The queen emphasized Spain ' s " basic " place for this type of finance
Spain has taken a visible place in the world in the field of microfinance.
The Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country had become a second donor in relation to the instruments of collaboration, whose "essence", she said, is that it was "the instrument of social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all mankind based on faith in people".
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valyadolide with the belief that " there is no doubt" that such actions are "perfectly necessary" to achieve the Millennium objectives set by the United Nations by 2015 and "specifically aimed at reducing the number of people living less than one dollar per day" is the level at which the "line of poverty" is established.
Spain " still works" to expand the net of recipients around the world and take this task with all "responsibilities", said Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "provide the creation of new capacities and best opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women, "the basic recipients of these jurisdictions".
There are many achievements and many difficulties we face.
Microcredit summit becomes not only a dispute area but also a platform that contributes to "two main objectives".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and a hundred million of these households would be emerged from the poverty they were in.
The impulse to create a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world " went on the way started years ago" by Mohammad Yunus, stressed Ms. Sofia as "Act of Justice and Recognition".
And she described the father of the instrument as a "delightful idealist in the universal case of poverty" whose work is known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study its credit policy.
This experience took over a year after the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have seen continuous development everywhere," said Her Majesty, whose connection with the project brought her yesterday the title "the heads of the family" gathered in Valiadolide "poor banker".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished the talk, calling on the attendees to participate in the discussion and find decisions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Himenes said that solidarity was a " ethical immperative" for each democratic State.
Therefore, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with the periods of economic paper, as it was a " persistent commitment " .
Hemenes concluded that the microcredit implies a " serious and firm course to eradicate poverty " and now " greater than ever " Governments of developed countries should work according to solidarity criteria and not allow it to become a victim of reducing costs.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, appreciated the " success" in giving "confidence" to the "occupied" people with all the doors closed" and Mayor Valjadolida Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all the people in the city who "opened his doors covered by the spirit of solidarity".
HDC invites the President of the European Commission to vote in general
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (HDS) on Monday 14 November in Leipzig was without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it was the autumn itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is not as strict as it should be, today, as regards Greece and perhaps tomorrow in relation to Italy....
The draft resolution on the chairmanship in the European Commission, which was held by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained from the vote.
The ovations, which continued for a few minutes, which deserved Angel Merkel's speeches and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schoible, Europhil and the Minister of Finance, did not leave room for doubts.
The basic idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slope: the right response to the crisis is “not less than Europe, but more Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs are dependent directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, it is time for a breakthrough in Europe.
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union ' s control of the financial policy of the eurozone countries, but this could also affect the elections of the President of the European Commission by the universal voting "to give a person to Europe".
In any case, it was one of the proposals for the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, whose idea is obviously the idea of Wolfgang Shoible.
Of course, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven countries will quickly agree with this decision; Britain is opposing it, and the HDS leaders believe that Nicola Sarkozy is also against it.
But the soil is prepared.
Similarly, delegates rejected the proposal for each country member of the European Central Bank to raise the vote in the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In order to relieve the situation in its party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Cole, but it did not seek to influence the congress through the " small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation that loved to criticize "Higher" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devoted the importance of the " Hermano-French friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
It's just past the door.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Laipzig became a scene of bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating injuries of the Napoleon Army.
What is fraud with hospital leaves?
Following the cash benefits, UMP and the Government began the attack on hospital leaves.
On 15 November, Nikola Sarkozy will arrive in Bordo to visit the family fund and to speak on this issue, which has periodically been raised since 2007, on the fight against fraud in the field of social benefits.
In order to help this occurrence of the desire to save in difficult situations, but also a part of the campaign for re-electing rights to the president, most people wish to focus on hospital leaves.
First, in view of the budget savings, the Government intends to impose private companies on the fourth day of unpaid leave before the payment of the benefit.
Apparently, without the special agreement of the employer, the sick worker will lose his salary for four days, a minimum of 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
The measure that threatens the anger storm, but which, according to Les Echos, will result in the savings of 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose public servants one day without paying the disease benefit (the public servants have not yet had to wait for the benefits, unlike the three-day expectation of private sector workers).
Now that these issues are discussed, the majority also raises the subject of fraud, in view of abuse in the issue of hospital leaves.
The control will become more hard and more vital if you are caught, you will have to return all the payments you have illegally received," Xavier Bertran warned on the RTL channel on Saturday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement was somewhat unproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital leaves.
They are indeed subjected to continuous control and political attacks since 2002.
People in France are not more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the numbers in the country first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to EUR 11.3.000 per cent of general health costs.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were related to decrete vacation and accidents in production and 54 per cent to disease benefits, which amounted to EUR 6.2 million.
Thus, 2,5 per cent of health costs were composed.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to an Alma Consulting Group.
The average arithmetic, which covers some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the Monster.com Career Manager website showed that 75 per cent of 40,000 French employees said they did not take a hospital day.
Another study, this time relating to health insurance, states that in 2010, 37 per cent of hospitals were less than 8 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent longer.
In comparison with the numbers of European neighbours, French workers are not more inclined to take a hospital than any other country.
A long study conducted in 2010 by the two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the total share of lack of work in France (for health or not) declined between 10 per cent and 11 per cent compared to 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud related to hospital sheets is very low compared to the gray employment.
As to the level of fraud, it is very low.
The expiry of the law after 2002 resulted in a systematic check of hospital duration over 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1,5 million CNAM verified cases, 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term disease findings were " unreasonable " or too long " , which consists of 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically verified hospital leaves, more than 45 days 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “inappropriate or unfounded”, equal to 132 000.
In general, 169,000 cases were " unreasonable" for several million of workers who received hospital leaves.
The numbers that show very few cases compared to, for example, series of employment.
According to UMP Dominic Tian, the author of the report on this issue in June, they amount from 9 to 15 million euros of non-profit budget income per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papademos: Greece should follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new resolution programme to save its economy.
On Monday, on 14 November, Prime Minister Lukas Papadimos said that 100 days provided to his coalition Government were not sufficient to meet the task.
"To achieve the economic salvation goals, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budget adjustment," said the chairman of the Government, who made his first public statement, opening a discussion on the volume of confidence in the parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the Eurozone on 27 October should be a " basic task" of the new Government, as the presence of the country in the Eurozone was " maped " , he added.
Accordingly, Papademos predicts a reduction in the country ' s budget deficit " to approximately 9 per cent " from GDP to the end of the year, with 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Rights reject the measures of the new Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the Leader of Rights, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support further strict savings.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the representatives of his party, New Democracy.
He expressed its consent with the objectives of reducing deficits and debts and combating diversions, but also its failure to take any course that prevents the recovery of the economy.
Ollie Renu, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary loan of 8,000 million euros without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and suicide should be legalized with foreign assistance, stated the Committee of Experts
Canadians are rejected in death, as approved in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together in order to ensure the best inflammatory assistance, without counting cancer.
Canadians are refused to die.
Only 9 per cent of the Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the impressive conclusions of the report of the Royal Society of Canada, which took part in six experts from different areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the Penal Code in order to authorize suicide with foreign assistance and eutanasia when the choice is subject to circumstances and the patient may be considered competent for such a decision.
For the beginning, experts refer to a recent study of the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada is in 10 place, the study notes that “medication of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to argue on death”.
Because of medicinalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians have no access to palliative assistance, reports experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6 per cent of them end with death in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country in Quebec, where 86 per cent of the deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasy and suicide, the authors of the report have concluded that contrary to the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that he would not want to change anything in the criminal code on eutanasy and suicide with foreign assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminated, there is no evidence that this decrimination involves abuse in the application, such as euthanasy or suicide with foreign assistance to people who cannot or want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, which presented the report, confirmed that most of the cases were in countries where euthanasy and suicide were not legalized with foreign assistance.
Eutanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
Suicide with foreign assistance is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal, explained Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be recalled that 85 per cent of the Canadians are in favour of eutanasia, because, according to Angus Reid's 2010 survey, they believe that this would allow people to relieve their suffering at the end of their life.
And 66 per cent believe that the legalization of euthanasia would not be a signal that the lives of older people or persons with disabilities are less valuable.
With regard to people who were suicide aiding, 41 per cent of the questionnaires believed that they should not be persecuted criminally.
With regard to the extension or termination of health care for the sick, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that legally legally discontinued medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained with respect to denying medical care at the end of life without fear of criminal persecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls upon the Government, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together in order to develop the best possible palliative assistance and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal sedation already applied in the Canadian Health Institutes, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to reduce the physical pain of eutanasia and be subjected to the same restrictions.
Observations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Mayor Pierre Deshan, a health expert, described the " excess" position of experts who signed the report, because, among other things, it did not limit the use of eutanasy by death.
This opens a door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for suicide aid, said the meter of Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Mayor Dasham also emphasized that the authors of the report seem to be putting independence of the identity above all other values that constitute social tissue of society.
He said, "There are warning signs and bans in society."
The health law expert Margaret Somerville also expresses “categorical disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she referred to as “the manifest for eutanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests, inter alia, the report on abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide are legalized with foreign assistance, as in the Netherlands and Oregones.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to retire
Damascus condemns the conspiracy.
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar Asada, participants, held a demonstration yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar Asada has increased, which, with Russia's support, opposes him and condemns " conspiracy " against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syrian membership in the Arab League, the European Union stronged sanctions against Damascus, and the neighbours of Syria and Jordan resigned President Asada.
The King of Jordan, Abdalla II, yesterday became the first Arab leader who called on President Bashar Assad, departed from power in Syria, where about 40 civilians and armed forces were killed.
"If the interests of Bashar were expensive for his country, he should retire, but he should also establish the necessary conditions for the new stage of political life, said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in the BBC interview.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the mediation efforts of Turkey, which began at the beginning of this year, were not successful.
Those in the Middle East, who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their desires, will lose power, he said, implying Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a stronger course.
For their part, the United States welcomes the “enlargement of consensus against Assad and the action of the Syrian regime” followed by the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and such countries as Turkey are taking a growing course on the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, representative of the State Department.
During that period, 16 civilians and at least 19 representatives of the regime died in the area of Deroua in southern Syria, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observer (OSDH).
Two other inhabitants were killed during the shooting and the shooting of heavy guns in Jobara in the hosted city of Homms, according to UNG.
During the press conference, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Syria, Valid Muallem, said that the country was approaching the end of the crisis."
Furthermore, he took a sharp response to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which, he said, was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, as he assured that this conspiracy against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to exclude the Syria League of Arab States, it is currently exploring the “mechanism of protection of civilians and demands to the country of 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, journalists and military observers.
The Foreign Minister of France, Alan Juppe, also expressed his view of sending observers from the UN to help protect civilians from repression of the regime, which he said to have fallen into “paranoia”.
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the outcome plan of the crisis adopted on 2 November and envisages, inter alia, the withdrawal of armed forces from cities where the fights go, and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the decision of the League of Arab States yesterday, while China called upon Syria to implement the exit plan, but abstained from support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty requires time from Italian markets and victims
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked markets to form a team and implement a programme that would require sacrifices to restore the credit capabilities lost in the last few months of the Berluscony government.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate office, composed of technokrats not entering Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of the programme that envisaged many victims, said Francesco Nukara, a representative of a number of small parliamentary groups who participated in discussions after the meeting with the candidate for the Prime Minister.
Spiker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranko Finny, said he would wait to see if Mario Monty would ask Parliament to vote on confidence before Friday to make sure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monty ' s limited list of dozens or some of the ministers head of the country, George Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on the nervousness of the fund markets and bond holders yesterday, and asked them time.
“Democracy takes time to prepare the Government and the programme,” he emphasized, adding that it was convinced that the markets would be patient and understanding”.
His appointment by the President was initially approved by the markets, but concerns had occurred again, particularly after the unexpected fall of industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
Appointed Prime Minister had to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he emphasized that he would also like to include “politicians”.
The new Government will have to act until 2013, the dates of the following elections, he said.
According to the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies of Janfranco Finny, the new Government will receive the vocuum of Parliament's confidence on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that he would work hard to ensure that Italy would become an important acting person in Europe again.
The representative of the European Commissioner Ollie Rehn emphasized that “despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, believed that Rome would not implement the budget for 2013, despite the strict savings plan adopted in recent months, required, in particular, new strict measures.
The Italian Boss Emma Marchegalia, who would meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because the country that has no growth cannot comply with the deficit parameters”.
Mr. Monty, known as his competence and independence by the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents the " change of age" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", "professor" symbolising "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to the authors of the fronts.
The great unknown is the long-term of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid rapid elections, as by April 2012 Italy had to pay the amount of EUR 200,000.
Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
The Russian scientist Viceslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-suitable detonator, confirmed the American agency specialized in the field of nuclear danger on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations Agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed anxiety about the " possible military perspective " of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS, based significantly on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, working 30 years, " starting from the sixtieth years, in the Soviet nuclear centre in Chelabinsk (Ural) and joined in the production of synthetic explosive diamonds".
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to create a nanoalmass company in Kiev.
His financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia
In his report, IAEA mentions " significant signs of Iran ' s development of the nuclear detonator system that has "produced the work of a foreign expert who did not only well know this technique but also informed the agency that he had worked most of his career on this technology under the military nuclear programme of his country".
The number of muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBI statistics published in Monday from 2009 to 2010, the number of antimuslim crimes has almost increased by 50 per cent, while other forms of racial and religious violence in the same period have slightly decreased or had not changed.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, equal to 49 per cent increases, compared to an increase of 13 per cent of Catholic violence, 4 per cent of the attacks on Jews and a total increase of 14 per cent of religious crimes.
The total number of crimes due to hatred, according to the FBI, increased very little to 6 628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After the decline in 2009, the number of these crimes has increased again, emphasized the Human Rights First Human Rights Organization, “increasing violence against Muslims particularly”, added the organization in the official communication.
"Human Rights First has emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as all forms of hatred crimes, should be considered as serious violations of human rights," added one of the leaders of the organization Paul Lejandar.
"The American Government may and should do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, assuming that this could be done by improving police reports on hatred crimes."
"Aggressive crimes" in the federal law are the inheritance of the period of combating civil rights.
This law was adopted after Martin Luther King died to punish for acts of violence related to race, colour of skin, religion, nationality and sexual orientation today.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter microblog website has made changes to the presentation of its platform, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those whom they monitor, which makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new "action" tab and other "name" allow you to monitor the activities of other "twitters" and "Twitters" directly, the Internet users whose messages "tweets" you track and those who track yours.
This gives the opportunity to identify if they publish messages, if they are signed for new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested " at a small percentage of users in August" before the broad use of the network on Monday, said AFP press secret Twitter Caroline Penner.
Twitter, who has been known for a long time as intuitively unrecognized and uses quite uncertain terms (RT for a reconciliation of a stranger, #followfriday for the recommendation to track other users), mainly bringing pleasure to experienced users, opens itself in this way for a broader audience, representing users something closer to the popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
On the Internet, users discussed this innovation through Twites on the Internet.
"It's useless, nauseous and too much like Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my flow in Twitter, wrote @dannycronstrom.
Austria
Entry into the Constitution of the Golden Rule of Budget
The High Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budgetary " gold rule" into the Constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible reduction by Austria's public credit rating agencies (third A).
The Chancellor of the Social Democrat Werner Faymann personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, while the Austrian government debt was 74.6 per cent, much higher than the upper threshold of the standard of 60 per cent established by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the State debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's payment capacity had fallen only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay per cent of three thousand million euros more every year, the argument of Vice-Kancelar and the Minister for Foreign Affairs from Christian Democrats, Michael Spindeleger.
Thus, Austria fulfils the summit of the eurozone member countries in Brussels on 26 October; heads of States and Government required reductions in budget deficits by the end of 2012 and return to balanced public accounts through the constitution or equal law.
The provision adopted by the Austrian Government reminds the “German model” because Germany was the first European country to adopt this rule.
By 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), and from 2017 the structural deficit of the State budget of the Federal State should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP each year and the land, as well as the communities, should be balanced budgets.
The goal is to make the State debt fall below the 60 per cent marked by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esichico Noda
threatens new intervention in the currency market
Japanese Prime Minister Esichiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would carry out new interventions in the currency market if the cost of yen continued to grow.
We will interfere with the way that we did it last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the yena exchange course, Mr. Noda Senatu explained.
On Tuesday, Yen grew up nearly before the historical mark, which encouraged the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokio sold a yen for dollars large to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has established a new power record since 1945.
Since then, however, Yen has grown constantly induced by purchases of investors who perceive it as “a asylum” in these sad times of the falling economy throughout the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 Yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic plane in 105 yen, near the level that led to the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar cost about 120 yen and over EUR 160.
The increase in Japanese currency damages Japanese exports because it makes Japan more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese companies from abroad when converting into national currency.
"Japan is fighting to restore itself" after the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March, which deserted the region of Tohoku (North East), emphasized Mr. Noda, who fears that this yena growth will kill a stiff fetus of recovery.
The third in the world has resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time per year, through export and consumption of households affected by the disaster
However, the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect the “fundamental economic indicators of Japan”.
The Minister of Finance, June Azumi, called on the Japanese Bank (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of his monetary policy council, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Manager of Hirohide Yamaguti warned that the Japanese Bank had already taken " appropriate steps " and realized that there should be no further mitigation in the Wednesday.
At the latest meeting, at the end of October, the emitting organization increased by 5,000 million yen (47,000 million euros) the purchase of treasure bonds, raised up to 55.000,000 million yen (519,000 million euros) of the ceilings it allocated to purchase various financial instruments to satisfy the market of valuable papers.
Eurozone
The rates are growing, the fund markets are collapsing
The risk of infection by the debt crisis undermines European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, the rates in unstable countries continue to increase
The eurozones still concerned about stability, European markets went a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4% and ended trade at 3.064.
DAX in Frankfurt has fallen to 0.4%, and London is 0.1%.
In connection with new difficulties in paying credits by eurozone countries in difficult situations, fund markets worldwide continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
"The troubled investors are just too concerned about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional IG Markets broker quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo market was closed by 0.7 per cent under the burden of new market constraints on the ability of Europe to restrain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has constrained its view of Europe and the markets will follow each other in the hallway of narrow changes until the investors have confirmed that the situation has been stabilized," Micusige Akino, manager of the Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This return of anxiety about the future eurozone beats a single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lower mark in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency cost $1.3570, dropping by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it fell after the Chancellor's party, Angela Merkel HDS, on Monday, which had adopted a resolution, providing, inter alia, the possibility for the country in a complex situation, to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are significantly higher than 6 per cent
The loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at a high level of concern.
This morning, on Tuesday, the income of Italian 10-year-old bonds reached 6.85 per cent, and the Spanish bond income with the same time of exemption reached 6.2 per cent.
Those difficulties with interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to undermine the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked the time market to restore the situation in Italy under threat of paralysis under his debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the eurozone, on 27 October, would be the " basic task" of his Government.
Spain was shocked in front of parliamentary elections on Sunday.
In front of the interest rates on 10-year debt obligations of Germany and Spain reached a new historic maximum.
Awaiting growth figures in Eurozone
France has established an economic growth by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent, thanks to increased domestic consumption.
Insee, however, has reviewed the reduction of the number of the second quarter, with a 0.1 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) falling instead of stagnating.
The economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, found a 0.5 per cent increase in the same period.
The first assessment for the whole eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is a theme that cannot be decided after a non-continued discussion or under emotion, it is an energy policy.
The availability and value of electricity directly affect the purchase capacity and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that the election meetings are the reason for thinking about the lower and nuclear energy site.
The dispute will not bring fruit until all economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
France should build its views on objective facts and rational data.
We are now 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will double electricity requirements by 2050, unless the vast part of the world's population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fulfil the growing deficit of exploited resources to continue the production of electricity constantly, without forgetting the essential need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate imbalance, the subject that disappeared from environmental debates.
The Facility on Fucusim does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which decides on the need to find a source capable of replaceing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, there are only few of those who continue their projects decisively.
The United States decided after Fukusima to add one installation to its own set by renewing the construction of the station that was suspended after the tri-Mile Island accident.
Although the renewable energy model of Germany is sometimes illustrated, the reality is contrary to this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, the shift of carbon gas emissions in connection with the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be already felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European champion for the construction of turbines, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest carbon and gas consumer because of the interrupted wind; therefore the emissions of carbon gas and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher than the average of Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40 per cent more for electricity than French households.
Since the globalized energy price is a key factor in competitiveness and the supply of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Consequently, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will illustrate the illusion of the new industrialization of our country and the protection of buying capacity.
The price most French refused to pay, even more because they did not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create a industry sector in 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 focused.
It is strongly oriented to export, and attracts the entire pawn of specialized in international trade in small and medium enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved into another sector.
If France had decided to renounce nuclear energy, it would have sacrificed a large amount of these enterprises and lost 6,000 million euros a year from the French export of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer will order the EPR designed to work for sixty years if it is scheduled to close its manufacturer?
In order to decide the equation of energy, it should be recognised that there are no divine or devil sources of energy production.
The development of the Areva solutions with low carbon gas emissions, nuclear and renewables demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
Nuclear energy supporting the highest level of security is definitely a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that is carrying out an integral and transparent control of existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionalism is generally recognized are full of the same security obsession.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry survived three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, has occurred under normal conditions of exploitation, but without any consequences for human or environment
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and the unforgiving human error led to tragedy.
In Fukusim, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented force that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident, as it learned from the two previous.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between security bodies, operators and French and German designers, the EPR, represents a project to resist such phenomenons.
As it is considered by all energy experts wishing to build a reactor, the cease of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift to the Areva and EDF competitors, clearing their way to win leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and maneuvers to gain overcome in a dispute which is so important to our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration - burden or good for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from various parties -- the overload of police, judicial and administrative services under the figure policy and compatibility of this policy with the self-approved status of France as “the State of Human Rights”.
There was then an administrative distress of foreign students, which came to the news when the Minister for Interior (Liberasion) of 23 May) stated that France “does not need foreign talents, stonemen and waiters”.
But it is rarely analysed in economic terms.
The right and left are in a great deal in that regard.
The right tone was asked by Jacques Schirak, who said in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed people would not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers”, but by the left, Michel Rockar, who explained in 1990 that France “can't accept poor people from around the world”.
Difference only in generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the country was felt by both the left and the right of the Polish waterkeeper.
Both parties see the burden of immigration for the French economy and the French society.
The difference only in the level of generosity that they will allow to show to immigrants.
In his programme, François Olland was limited to banalities, saying that “the joint work will allow us to solve our problem of immigration”.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may give a selective advantage, but it is very costly economically.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron reminds us in the recent book of the recent data on immigration (Special people: As migration has formed our world and determines our future, May 2011, the publication of the University of Princeton, 352 s.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries taking immigrants.
Limitation of immigration leads to weakening growth and reducing employment.
The fears of immigrant influence are based on the idea that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-qualified, causing a reduction in salary.
Experience, however, shows that immigrants are much more complementary in reality than replace local workforce by carrying out work that lacks local workforce.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local workforce, but most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not related to job proposals.
Positive impact on wages
Just as the surgeon would have been difficult to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, the completion that exists between local and immigrants has led to a positive impact on the earnings of local workers.
Giovanni Perry estimated that the increase by 1% of the migration flow increases by 0.6 to 0.9 per cent of real long-term salary.
This is not in the light of the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (mean American Nobel Prize laureats, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make net profits to the social security system, giving average 1% of the general budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, in Germany, when an immigrants aged 30 years of age, the public budget will make a net profit (income minus expenditure) in the average of 150,000 euros.
Nicola Sarkozy was going to get " tooth" into the missing growth points at the beginning of his mandate.
Those teeth that were used to frighten immigrants have made a contrary effect.
Europe has invented democracy, European democracy remains to be developed
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but at the same time it is soft.
The European continent should remember that, inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, it survived the tragedy of I World War, the totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulago, as well as Franko in Spain, Salazara in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that democracy would definitely reinforce its enemies, sufficiently set up a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's time, the Small has been known that this is from the surface of thinking.
The universal voting, although is a mandatory condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even become a " instrument of depression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Washro once said.
No, democracy also requires a wide range of public space, public spirit, values, organization, division and control of powers, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we suffer is a economic crisis, but primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinodia of the true-false Greek referendum would have a double disclosure effect, showing both the need for serious policy change and the disagreement of its inability and inconsistentity.
This duality must be developed to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line for democracy has now moved and, in many, republican soldiers are now targeting the wrong way.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums organized as appropriate and in a chaotic manner.
Cart Blanche for the absolute European monarch or jumping with the bound legs into the ruin of nationalism - what a choice for the citizens!
No, we do not dream of the spleening of gylotine, but of the implementation of -- joint, clear and continuous -- elections and democracy, this time at the general European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and none of them have to be listed yet, because there is only one crisis in Europe.
All Europe is fully subjected to the dictation of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole Europe is totally humiliated at the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of the sovereignty to Europe, but all Europe has gradually lost its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent to restore the management of the European project under the national sovereignty.
Because only joint work will be able to reduce the gravity of each one's debts, free them from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The exit of the crisis will require solutions at the general European level, and they cannot be adopted without full democratic legitimacy without bringing us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the socialists and Jacques Delor are now demanding a European economic government.
Let's do that.
However, imagining it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that exists in life is another madness and a new fool.
We must begin a new stage of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, the Republicans had to be created.
The revolution of interest would be inadequate.
This lesson remains strong.
We must build Europe, united at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating more democratic Europe at the political level, the present national European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
No contact cards are spreading wider.
The World Exhibition of Chip Cart is opened on Tuesday in Wilpent under Paris in the atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 11 per cent of the world's microprocessor sales (bank cards, SIM cards) will be completed in 2011 by over 6,000 million units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important sector of incontact technologies that allows public transport or purchase to be paid, simply by carrying out a map on the reader.
This year, 460 million uncontacted chip cards will be sold in the world against 320 million years earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (awaiting 580 million units) and will be nearly 10 per cent of the world market of chip cards (6.925 million cards).
Europe, long-term departing from the Asia-Pacific region, is now in progress in the area of incontact payments.
Approximately 26 million banking cards of Visa are already supplied by this function and are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France starts with more modest positions: the treatment of Visa is 400 000 incontact cards.
But big shops make it more pace.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontacted Pass MasterCard.
To move to higher speed, banks need to supply their customers' equipment.
"Two large organizations in France have promised in the future to systematically distribute banking maps to their clients, " said Gerar Nebui, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
The banks are testing payments by mobile phone.
But it's only the first stage of the development of the future payment fund, the mobile phone.
As long as few devices are equipped with NFC technology (Near field communications) necessary to carry out such transactions.
"They were delayed.
"But they must really fly away next year."
"We are counting on world sales between 80 and 120 million units in 2012," explained Mark Berten, chap. Eurosmart.
But the banks are going forward.
Credit Agricole announced yesterday an experiment from December to June next year in Cana.
The iPhone approximately 200 clients and staff will be supplied with non-contact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And Société Génerale also said yesterday that he was preparing the launch of a proposal to allow his clients to pay through mobile phones.
The terrorist front is extended from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links of Islamic Magrib with the Sect Boco Haram.
Reaffirmed long-terrorism links between the Al-Qaid terrorist group in Muslim Magrib (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sect Boco Haram.
On Sunday, Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel even stated that the Algerians were now confident.
"The way that these two organizations use and the reports of secret services show that they are actively cooperating," he explained, without being detailed.
Paris seems to have made similar conclusions.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two French in Niger in January revealed two linkages.
The abducted in a restaurant in Niamea of people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leokur and Vensan Delori were evidently killed next day with several of the kidnappers during the operation carried out by the French special units.
Among the fractures left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone sim-cards belonging to terrorists.
Here's a terror.
Analysis of the calls indicated several interviewers in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one indicates a Nigerian who lived long in Midiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, a colleague of Boco Haram, and the other is asserted as a person close to Aqmi and to the sect.
"It is a step forward, but it must certainly wait for more reliable evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boco Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for many years that the sect has received financial and imminent support outside and that it is increasingly active," said the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuvo.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly clear on the actions and statements of Boco Haram and its methods, which now include the use of mortals and the more complex explosive devices of the same type as the Aqmi.
The international community, headed by Washington, is now pressured on Abuja to focus on the problems Boco Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities traditionally viewed this group as an educated community of no interest.
Quick Success
Based in 2002 in Mayiguri at the machete, school and with the Foundamentalist Mohammede Yusufe, Boco Haram, which means "the west education is sin" - preaching the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in Muslim North of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved a rapid success.
It was politicized and demanded strict compliance with the sharia, and its activists began fighting the wicked central government.
It is aimed mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the activists of Boco Haram showed special activity by executing numerous attacks on police offices.
Abuji's response is, as usual, compromiseless.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead after it.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
The sect is now radicalized and out of its northern edges.
In the past Christmas, she took responsibility for an action that resulted in 80 people killed in José, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Abudz Boco Haram organized the first death attack on a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is from Mauritania through Nigeria in Somalia, is now concerned with all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi has been strengthened in Mali and Niger and the Al-Shabab Somalians are in Kenya, Boco Haram presents a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during the interview with Presidents Goodlack Jonathan Alen Juppe warned about the danger of Boco Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
Peace as the Republican candidates see it as Presidents
With regard to China, Iran and Israel's assistance, Mit Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry are competing in simplifications and incompetentity.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, lead a complex world through simple, more specifically simplifying ideas?
If the candidates were listened to the presidents of the Republicans, the voters could believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying loud, but deprived of the foreign policy statements, which traditionally are the strong side of the Republicans.
The slopes relating to China, Iran and Israel's assistance are often mixed with each other.
The Mitt Romney, who has the best chances to move from the Old Good Party, threatened the Chinese to complain to WTO and to accuse them of "the manipulation of its currency" is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the entire industry's migration in Asia.
It's worse if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China, and the only candidate who deals with a complex foreign policy, was unable to overcome an emotional position.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is held at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard.
Reagan's style
Romni also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions could not stop his nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran," he said."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel's military assistance by accusing Obama of non-compliance with the partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second in the candidate rating, demonstrated the disrupting ignorance of cases.
He recently called for the opposition of the Chinese military threat because Beijing has been trying to gain nuclear power - apparently not knowing that China has already had it since 1964!
Governor of Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and strives for military attacks on Iran, said he was willing to use the American army in Mexico against drug carts.
Torture of suspects in terrorism banned by Obama in 2009 also recommended Kane, Perry and Michel Bahman.
All of this is very far from the candidate of the Republic of 2008, John McKain, a heavy foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say that Reagan had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower the tone against terror.
They have insisted on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the early withdrawal of the " boys" from Iraq, his tricks in Libya that brought him a reputation of a weak policy.
But the attack is not that easy.
The population considers the positive balance of national security in Obama, which eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are bound in the sand.
And claiming that America must be rebuilt economically in order to restore its leadership, Obama's rights.
North Stream, new gates for the accession of Russian gas to Europe.
The northern stream linking Western Europe and Russia directly at the bottom of the Baltic Sea is launched.
It is based on gas supplies equivalent to 30 million households.
The gasprom, the Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with the pump.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on last Tuesday in the Baltic Shore, between the orchestra and the excellent meals, in the opening of the North Stream, the new gas pipeline, which directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Feyon and his Netherlands colleague, Mart Rutte, together returned a symbolic ventilator controlling the accession of Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline of 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will enter Western Europe each year on the first pipeline length of 1.224 km connecting the Leningrad area with the land of McLenburg-Mearing.
The second pipeline should be prepared at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to all the consumption of France.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met the strong opposition of Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany by avoiding passing through the third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the North Stream with the new German-Soviet Covenant, implying the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supplies.
But at the price of the deprivation of the energy of Europe, because the project created a brete between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has achieved its understanding of the direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries that have consumed large amounts of gas and their own stocks.
"This gas tube is part of Russia's cooperation, a new arterial that organicly links us," said François Feyon, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating how important and political and economic are gas contracts.
All of this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom, who were present in a large quantity in Ljubmin, the gas arrival point.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical movement.
The underwater pipeline is made of a steel locked in concrete to protect it from cocores of ships.
He's lying on the bottom of the sea, at the middle of 200 meters.
To build it, the mine fields left since World War II had to be circled.
"The hundred had to be removed or destroyed as precaution," said Jans Mueller, the press secretary of the North Stream.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal serpent of weight, equal to 242 Eiffel towers, no breaks across its length, no vents and no service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers rejected it, because Sweden was not admired by the Russian State company to be settled at its shores forever.
"In the case of an accident, we will overcome the flow of gas in less than a minute," said Jens Mueller.
So, if the gas in the gas pipeline is exhausted.
But this seems to be a low-like designer that designed the shives calculated only once for 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the gas pipeline will be carried out by a subwater robot pulling the ship for external monitoring, as well as by a circulation system within the gas-control.
The cigar-like device is inserted within the pipeline with a diameter of 1 m and stretched forward through the gas flow.
On arrival after 3 full days of trip with a speed of 3 metres per second, it gives precise information about any metal deformation.
The gas pipeline was designed for work for 50 years without the need for smaller repair.
The circulation of the gas is carried out only through its pressure.
It consists of 200 bars and 100 bars at arrival.
Five companies have cooperated efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51 per cent of capital.
Others are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), Netherlands Gasunie and the French GDF Group Suez (9 per cent each).
These five companies created a joint enterprise called the North Stream, which was assigned to build and operate the gas-train.
His headquarters are in Zuga, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Then Gazprom rented the company for twenty years, with the possibility of prolonging the total amount of gas transport.
" Gazprom will pay for the full amount, no matter how much gas will be actually transported," said Jens Mueller.
The financing of the gas pipeline was 30 per cent of shareholders and 70 per cent bank loans.
The total cost of work will amount to 7.4 million euros for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be approximately 240 million.
But ministerial shareholders are confident that they will buy their expenses because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Ljubmina to the sand coast, planted by wave trees.
The ventiles are 4.5 meters high, forming the gas exit terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific gas characteristics before transferring it to German gases.
From last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
This will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine Brand
Moleskine, created by the Italian company 15 years ago, will regain the taste of the letter.
He has the smell of adventures, the hours spent in writing at the light of the candle.
Moleskine's block is easy to learn on a straight-hand black cover, on the tire, on the yellow-white pages, as if yellowed with time.
However, the book Moleskine, which we know today, was born in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo, which is in Milan, decided to sell design records.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, took responsibility for the launch of a new product.
The block is inspired by an old production technique, a moleskin, a lactated boy-paper tissue used, for example, to cover stones.
It is asserted that the type of notes is highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought an old and forgotten taste today, which was a cultivation for the awangard artists before the twentieth century," said Mary Sebregondi, who has since become an administering brand in Modo Modo.
Good luck.
Since 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million dollars.
We were far away from the production of the first years when only 3,000 blocks were made.
Moleskine crossed the borders of Italy and exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It's hard to establish a typical buyer ' s profile because the recording is equally attracted to businessmen, students and people of free profession.
The customers of Moleskine are cosmopolitical, have wide views and are educated.
A small Italian company, which had only 12 staff at first, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It spreads its bookmarks in the book stores of Fnac, the shops in small cities centres, and has been able to acquire a wide familiarity.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new letter requirement, despite the e-mail appearance," explained Mary Sebregondy.
This characteristic cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; the brand has recently organized the exhibition of the Environmental Way, where the architects and artists demonstrated their own notes.
In August, he also launched covers with a leopard painting on the event of a film festival in Lokarno.
Using its success and cultural aurum, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and Brand includes all types of support.
Success that had resulted in envy: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, now Syntegra Capital, which entered a new page in Moleskine history.
Why is unemployment among disabled workers so high?
About 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of the employment of persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public charity policy started in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities remains twice above the average, namely 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the general population.
Restraining?
“No,” emphasized Eric Blanche, Director-General Adapt, a organization that organizes a week of the employment of persons with disabilities.”
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"In that time the unemployment share was not two, but three times more."
"There's still a lot of work ahead."
It must be said that there are still many difficulties in employment for a disabled person.
Among them is more than 37 per cent older than 50 years (17 per cent in the average).
They have a lower level of qualification: 80 per cent do not have a degree of graduation, but only 10,000 persons with 2.3 million students in higher education.
Finally, long unemployment is very common, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities against 38 per cent in the average.
Shortly, all these criteria make it very complicated to return to work and which constitutes the issue," said Christian Grapen, Director-General of Tremplin, of the Association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about mentality that's changing, but too slow.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre Reservation Association of Cite showed that the managers in question had a low level of knowledge of disability and “represented people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally incomplete”.
The result is that more than 20 employees have 6 per cent of persons with disabilities established in the law adopted in 1987.
The latest known figures relating to 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"We are about 3 per cent today," said Pierre Blan, Director-General Agefiph, organization responsible for collecting tax from companies that do not comply with this law.
Proof: the number of " taxed " organizations, as well as paid amounts, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Act of 2005, which raised tax, created a strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blane.
"But this improvement also reflects a growing awareness, in particular in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of the organizations with a number of workers from 20 to 49 have disabilities against 82 per cent of organizations with a number of workers from 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness."
Before fighting with Blue evening on Tuesday (20.45 p.m.), Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasures they received from this friendly match.
We're not going to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
By sitting next to Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months later, the Belgian coach can only commend him after his assault at Turkey's match.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go on," assures Lill's player.
The contrast between his achievements in the club and the gathering is one thing, he justified.
"I'm in Lille a round year, and I'm not in Belgium."
"I have to earn glasses."
The reserved, in front of this game with France, in the game against Romania on Friday night, Azar arrived in St.
Notwithstanding, however, the concept of satisfaction.
He supported the Blue since he was 7 years old and victory campaigns 1998 and 2000.
"I've always supported them, he confirms.
Of course, this also strengthens the special nature of this match.
Especially that the other side is Matthew (Debushi), Johann (Kabe) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We just crossed our ways."
"There's a chance to play against them, it's pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly remembered pride.
"Honour" to play "the holiday match."
"Honour" also claims as a neighbor, that France has become a very high-level team only a year after the Nazne injury.
"Loran Blan was like a thunderstorm, he admires.
Now that Belgium misss the next Euro, the technical sportsman will fly on one blue plane... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something, the ambitious players, they're hungry."
"You'll make sure of the future matches, including that against France."
Portugal is very confident
Portugal, Paul Bent, launched its response to Bosnia (22:00) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On his way, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most important, happy country."
Paul Bent is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the Congregation, which has been running since September 2010, has been qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and Bosnia to be won.
Given 0-0 on Friday in Hell, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal had dominated more than an hour in the match, it failed to achieve the covenant goal that would calm her down.
"This is a good result which, however, takes a certain risk."
But the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, at their bright stadium of de la Lus in Lisbon, in the eyes of the audience, which should be excited, although the match would be very tense," said the optimist but reasonable Bent.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50 per cent of the chances to be at Euro 2012," said the successor of Carlus Caeros.
On Friday, a fight against Bosnia requires the Portuguese victory.
No one could arrange the Bosnians.
"It is a good result in which, however, a certain risk is regrettable to Bent.
"We will play against a team that has many technical dignitys and players with many individual dignity," he added.
As in Zenice, the Portuguese will have the maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning, "do not give them time to think."
Good idea, if only this time it was realistic.
