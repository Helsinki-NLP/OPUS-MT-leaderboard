Stay there.
Head or letter?
I wouldn't hurt you.
Are you a student?
I like watching you work.
Oh, my God!
I'm fine.
Do you want to hear the truth about that event?
What's your nationality?
Be ready.
I'm kidding.
Excuse me, do you speak English?
Move quietly.

In this stage of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know that and I know that. Among you, there is no one who dares to write his sincere opinion, and if anyone of you would write it in advance would know that it would never appear in the press. I've received my regular pay to keep my honest opinion outside the newspaper I'm working for. Many of you are also paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what you honestly think would find out outside, on the street, looking for some other work. That I'd let my right opinion appear only in one edition of the newspaper for which I work, I'd get a quiz from work in less than 24 hours....

Girl Pizza and Mr. Casa were walking in the woods.
Anyway, you're wrong.
Redheads are driving me crazy!
Man has a lot of desires that he doesn't really want to be achieved, and it would be wrong to assume the opposite.He wants them to remain only wishes; they have value only in his imagination; their accomplishment would be a bitter disappointment for him. That's one wish and a desire for everlasting life. If it was fulfilled, a man would become completely sick of infinite life, and would want death.
