In an emergency call, the professor admitted he shot his girlfriend.
During the call for an emergency line with a shaking voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to the police that he shot his girlfriend and they needed to come home to them.
Lamb assumed that his "sweet dog" was the house alive and probably upset, and that contacts with the dead woman's family can be found on her phone.
Inside the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a manually written message on a white office paper, "I am so sorry and I wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," the letter that the authorities signed by Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would go 300 miles to the school campus where the police believed that he shot the favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at his office.
Chief of the police at Delta State University Lynn Buford said the university employees heard shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb said he made a fate call on the emergency line shortly afterwards.
Finally, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at school, students and the faculty forced them to hide behind the locked doors, the authorized authorities are still trying to see what Lamb's motivation was.
The details published by the investigators on the side of the State, both students and employees who knew him, together created a picture of a talented but probably a difficult teacher.
Students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
The Gautier police, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no records in the criminal record or a violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote, thanking "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught at the social science and history faculty along with the other 17th members of the faculty and many students attended a course at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations with regard to problems.
The student who praised Lamba, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and distressed, "as anything would be wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb has already asked Delta State University for free for health reasons he said he had a problem.
And this year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes on the recruitment of university employees meant that the doctorate on which Lamb worked hard would not guarantee him an automatic functional period to become a assistant of a professor.
The president of the University William LaForge said he didn't know about any conflict between Lamba and Schmidt, but that Mr. Lamba "seely had something to worry."
The Lamb will no longer answer these questions.
After he left the campus, the police caught his trail when he crossed the border of the state of Arkansas back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with the only shot from a gun at the courtyard of the house about a mile from his parents in Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed the coroner of the State of Washington, Methel Johnson.
He left the car launched on the street.
It wasn't clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he probably knew people living here.
The Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started working at the university, which has 3500 students in the city reading about 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 and taught geographical and educational classes.
On spring, he got a doctorate in education.
One of the long-term friends of Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through common friends.
She was with her friends in high school and he was the great older boy who taught her to play guitar for a few years.
He was a pretty heartbreaker then.
The heart of all the girls appeared as soon as he appeared," says Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss allegedly walked together for a while.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the wedding record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house next to the gautier river's shoulder.
The police said the dog was fine.
Former husband Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, which is now 19 years old.
"She was completely collapsed," said O'Steen about her daughter.
She was the best friend with her mother.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lamba, but through his daughter Abigail knew that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when Abigail and Abigail graduated at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator in The Julep Room, slowly lighted bar near Gautier, said that the last time he saw Lamba and Prentiss in the night of September 5th, the sweat that Lamb won on the guitar and harmonic for the unbroken crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple," he said.
We were flattering and recording each other for a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a seminar in the first year and specialized in the original American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor in school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at the State University Emporia in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and the government of students.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including members of the faculty, employees, students and members of the community, attended a reminder with candles.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigilia, during which the university congregation sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Wednesday school started again.
"We're trying to get our students back," says LaForge.
The crisis's over.
This is the day of treatment.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans also contributed to this report.
This story was adjusted to reflect the fact that the police now claim that Lamb made a call on an emergency line after he killed Schmidt, and that even though Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there's no evidence that they were actually a gap.
Toys R Us plans to hire less seasonal workers
Toys R Us declares that they will not take as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturer of children's toys and products claims that they will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work for more hours.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 40,000 employees in shops and distributing centres around the country, which is a decline in comparison with 45,000 past season.
Most jobs will be partly worked.
The company declares that it will start with the seizure of applicants this month, and the employees will be collected during October until December.
While the holidays themselves are far from months, the purchase holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporaryly accept employees for services in shops and sales, for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "rand" with Princess Diana
The Prime Minister 'Return to the Future' was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also incredible for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royal family, when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the coming document, "Well in time."
The film begins, and I realize I'm at the reach of something that could be called a false date with the Princess of Wales.
"Return in time," is the document on "Return to the Future", which introduces conversations with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The Prime Minister for the Future was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is really the best travel document for me that has ever been filmed."
"Return in time" will be available to the VOD, DVD and in the selected movies in October.
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russian accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" of the conflict of nearly five years of conflict and more weapons will only make the violence and suffering of millions of people worse.
The head of the United Nations again urgently called upon all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unify and support the inclusive negotiation on the finding of a political solution.
Ban said at the Central Press Conference that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of five permanent councils of countries - USA, Russia, China, Britain and France - at the edge of the Ministerial Meeting at the end of this month for the discussion of the situation in Syria.
He expressed his regret that the Division in the Council and between Syrian people and regional powers "done this situation unresolved."
Ban called for five permanent members to demonstrate solidarity and unity shown in Iranian Nuclear Agreement in Syrian crisis resolution.
8 electoral numbers that show that Donald Trump in real light
Some attempted to identify him as a person who often changed their views.
Others have waved their hands like a joke.
And some are preparing for imposition.
But whatever some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the elections, they're unsuccessful.
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead of a two-digit number, and some people start to ask seriously what this means for the nomination chances of this magnate from the real estate area.
Of course, it's only the beginning of the election cycle.
Nothing of this says that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
The experts pointed out that in this period of 2011, the leadership of Rick Perry made the way to rise to Herman Cain, none of them eventually won the only position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he could hit in general elections.
But outside groups such as Super PAC Jeba Bush and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump's will to endure and start interpreting their dollars on the stand to drop it.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that the reality magnate is not just a minimal phase:
Trump's benefit assessment turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the middle of June, the Monmouth University vote showed that only two of the 10 Republicans have a positive view of this reality magnate.
In the middle of July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a favourable view of Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion on him.
And these numbers are kept in the starting stages.
After the Quinnipiac University vote last week, 60 percent of the Republicans had a positive view on Trump.
Two-third of the GOP voters would be satisfied with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67% of the Republicans stated that either they would be "national" or "happy" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two of the 10 stated that they would be "anger" from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates almost the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "loved" against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
Another closest at the level of excitement?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters claim that they would be "restrained" or "butted" if Jeb Bush's favorite would become a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump was widely criticised for his nausea and insults, 52 percent of the Republican voters are fully aimed at the idea that the reality is to magnify the right temperament for the post of the President, according to the Monday vote of ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number is held in the senator club of Iowa, which is the first in the country in which 52 percent of the Republicans think they have the leader's personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think that he has no personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 of the 10 independents say that his temperament does not belong to the White House, according to ABC/Post.
The Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their scientists' hats, the Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
On the question who will win the nomination of GOP, four of the 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to the CNN/ORC research last week.
That's a change from the late July when four of the 10 were betting their money on Jeba Bush.
Full publication: GOP voters had no clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time, 4 of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as a winner for 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
However, it appears that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as a true.
Although the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still defeats almost everyone.
Some scientists emphasize that the broken field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is difusionally spreaded between more than a dozen other candidates.
But the Monmouth University research in early September shows that in the hypothetical direct struggle between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump will receive almost always most support.
He leads over Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubi on 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie, 33 points in each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who defeats him?
Ben Carson would lead over a trader with a wide 19 points in a hypothetical match against one.
Most of Donald Trump's colleagues say they've already made their opinion.
The new Tuesday CBS/NYT survey shows that only more than half of the Trump supporting voters argue that they will no longer change their views.
It is obvious that a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that he would never change his mind.
46 percent state that they keep open back doors to change between candidates.
Still, Trump's current strongest opponent is his external colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who consider their opinion final would go twice more likely to vote for Trump.
6 of the 10 Republicans allegedly agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called the immigrants from Mexico "violents" in his campaign's announcement speech, the immigration is still being held as the main and central theme of the interview for 2016.
Some are afraid that Trump's nabubrity is taking away the key Spanish voters from the Republican party and the damage will force the rebranding.
But according to the new ABC/Post public opinion survey, six of the 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump in immigration matters.
As long as the theme of immigration remains in the light of the lights, Donald Trump will also remain.
The frustration from the government reaches new maximis.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today receive approximately half of the support from the Republican electors, especially in view of their state of outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans in the new Monday vote ABC/Post say they prefer a political alien than someone with government experience.
And they're very angry at Washington.
The voting of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "regretted" and 21% "desperately angry".
The House supported a larger share of coal fees of the State.
Czech Republic gets over 400 million.
The Ambassador in its first reading supported the government's novel of the upper law, which adjusts the amount of fees from the surface coal of the brown companies.
Minister Jan Mladek (CSSD) promised the Members that they would obtain additional money both by the state and the municipal budgets.
The proposal was criticised by the Members of the Opposition, who feared that the firms would no longer want to sponsor the cities, as they would pay higher fees directly to the state budget.The Charter in the first reading has supported the government's novel of the upper law, which, among other things, means that the State should receive a larger part of the fees from the coal of brown companies.
The share of the State shall increase by 67 per cent, while the share of the municipalities is reduced from 75 per cent to 33 per cent.
The proposal also modifies the method of calculating the refund for non-raising companies.
The change in the taxes for non-gross taxes will bring to the state treasure 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
The revenues of the municipalities should have a neutral impact according to the government, as the fee should be higher.
In the predloń year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns and a state budget of 150 million crowns.
The brown coal was made of about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns.
Novela also counts the increase of the remuneration from the receivable space with the allowance of 1,000 crowns per hectare per year.
Receipt of these refunds shall continue to belong to the municipalities in full.
The Minister of Industries Jan Mladek (CSSD) told the Members that the community would gain a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of fees shall no longer be fixed by the law, but it is set by the Government by its regulations.
Reimbursement shall be calculated as a quantity of quantities of quantities of unravel and rates for individual species of non-roasts.
According to the government, amendment, inter alia, is the cause of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, the Member of OS Marek Benda warned that the provision of a tax in accordance with the Regulation of the Government must not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Youth, it is not about taxes in this case, because the state is paying payments to the nursery that is a state property.
Expenditure shall only be received by the municipalities whose territory are subject to the burden.
In the case of depth carbon, three quarters of money will be given to the community and a quarter of the states.
The same ratio will be in case of radioactive mines.
The part of the money he chooses to pay charges will be purposely bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to repair damages after retail or to ensure the Banja rescue service.
The proposal was criticised by the opposition Members, who, in particular, claimed that they would harm the municipalities affected by the burden and the districts.
For example, Michal Kuchera (TOP 09 and Starships) warned that the firms would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities, as they would have paid higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunne one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Uswit) chosen in the Ustec region.
Before the increase of unemployment on Mosteck, the Member of KSCHM Han Aulical warned.
Kadner and Aulique failed to propose a novel to reject, Kuchera wanted the law back to the government to work.
The reasonable report states that the increase in carbon prices does not result in taxes, as more than 90 per cent are long-termly contracted.
Therefore, the main consumers like electricity or thermals should not feel the price growth.
"But, on the other hand, this fact increases the risk of increasing reimbursements to compensate for the effort to reduce its operating expenditure, which would mainly mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in employment fees is profitable.
According to the rapporteur of Roman Milan Urbana (CSSD), it is crucial for Members to know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and mainly the government's decision on carbon limits.
If the coal is to go beyond the limits, then it will have impacts on the remunerations for the State and the community, he stressed.
The Urban disagrees with the Youth in the fact that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czech Slovak Army should fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the CSA should be broken according to it for social, national economic and long-term stability of the country's energy.
The cheerful will lead the Czechs as a one, the weather will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennismen will appear at the fourth slaughter of Davis' cup in India on the table and this time each of them will probably hit the game.
Captain Jaroslav Narrator plans that, in view of the difficult conditions, the burden will be all over the quarter.
Dillie has a hot and high moisture of air, so there are difficult matches that can be stretched up to five hundred.
We need to take this into account.
I'd like to spread it by weather.
And according to what it looks like, he said he returned at today's Czech election training in the center of Radža Kumara Khany.
With the one team and the world's forty-five, he counts on Friday and Sunday two games.
Lucas Rosol and Radek Stepanic are probably in the position of the two.
I'd like almost everyone to join.
I'm slow in my head, but I'm not gonna say it yet, Captain said.
Another security in the Czech system should be Stephank's participation in the Saturday fourth game.
It's just a question who's going to stand next to the experienced deblist, which has in Davis' cup in the fourth balance of 18:4.
It won't be happy.
There are other options with Rosol, or Adam Paula.
"I really don't know who and how it will look," he said back.
It will decide according to the development of two games.
Varianta may be Paulasec, with Jolly surprised in the first round of winning in the tree over Australians.
"He's decent to the board," he said.
I did it against Australia, and when I play, I would like to show the same performance as I showed there since the second set.
"I'd like to bring a point for these experiences," said Paul.
The home sitting in Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP ladder), which won the challenger last week in Shanghai, where he defeated the third and fourth stairs of the ladder.
The two will be Somdev Devvarman (164).
They are both challengers and ours have experience with ATP Tour, but many times we have been convinced that the ladders in Davis' cup do not decide.
"Determines the current form, weather," said He.
Friday opening two games start at 6:30 SELC and can be dragged for weather.
He's supposed to rain, and the court is not under the roof.
However, it can be played for artificial lighting.
They've already burned it, and it's got some 2,000 luxury, which's enough.
"It should be placed beneath the light," he said back.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut on Prime Minister's Questions
From his election, Mr. Corbyna debut in PMQ is very excitedly expected
New employee Jeremy Corbyn will have his debut at Prime Minister's Questions later, and will have to cooperate with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly afternoon, while his performance is likely to be carefully examined by the media and the Members.
In his weekly expression, he asked " less theatre and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of the leadership of Mr Corby, which comes after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuc Tuesday speech to the annual convention.
Meanwhile, the decision of the labour leader to be quiet during the singing of the national hymna in the service on Tuesday to the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the battle on Britain met with a criticist of a number of conservative messengers and is the center of the attention of several stories on the title pages of the newspaper.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing national hymna has drawn attention to himself.
The speaker of Mr. Corbyna said he would "stay in a respectful silence" and recognize "the heroism of the royal aircraft in the battle of Britain."
However, Mr. Corbyn, Owen Smith, member of the Shadow Cabinet, told the BBC Two's Newsnight program that he recommended the labourist leader to sing the national hymna "without regard" on his conviction that the monarchy should be cancelled.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in the top team of Mr Corbyn, quoted the differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than six parliamentary parties originally supported him as leader.
Political correspondent BBC Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "oriented" after the appointment of Mr Corbyn through his position in the European Union and the government limit of doses.
Mr. Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Party had submitted modified proposals to remove the whole idea of the limit of doses.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, secretary of shadow work and retirement, said that the party "very clearly" resisted government plans to reduce the limit from $26,000 to $23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Staff Party, faced by David Cameron in the last decade of his election as the leader of conservatives.
The leader of the worker who promised a different approach to politics claims that he has ideas "from the crowd" on questions for Mr. Cameron and has over 30,000 proposals.
The MP Islington North claims that PMQ is too confrontative and that he will hold up both "national responses", and promises that he will focus on important problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, a shadow trade secret, will represent him at PMQ if he does not attend — for example when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the thought that he would let the other colleagues come out from time to time, because he had heard that he had discussed the whole matter with the speaker of the House John Bercov.
When Mr. Cameron became the leader in 2005, he said he wanted to depart from the "Punch and Judy" policy style, which was often connected to PMQ, but a few years later he admitted he failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, PMQ was seen as a key barometer of the judgement of leaders, their leadership and their position among other MPs, although the criticians argumented that they became a caricature and needed far-extensive reforms.

The pound increases, while the growth of salaries in Great Britain accelerates
The libra arrived in the following dates and showed the recovery of the British growth of remuneration, while FTSE 100 was conducted above by SABMiller's tender target.
Between May and June GB profits, including bonuss, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
That was the fastest since 2009, and it seemed like the estimates were approaching when the rates were raised.
Sterling increased more than 1% against a dollar to $1.5505 and was 0.84% above euro to €1.3730.
FTSE 100 has closed the index at 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional market share and jumped by 20% after he got an approximate offer from his rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine two largest beerwares in the world, and the approximation of marks such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging reports from the rival group of luxury goods Richemont.
The latest sales results of Richemont are above all expectations and show that sales in China, the key market for Burberry, began to rise again.
The shares in Glencore increased by 5% after the giant said they grew up by $2.5bn using shared accommodation as part of the debt reduction strategy.
The stocks in the package and paper group Mondi were the biggest failure on the index and fell by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs reduced his rating to the company to "sale".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports company announced 83% jump in the middle of the year in profits before taxing £46.6m
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could hurt the expansion
Executive JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that higher minimum remuneration for workers in the United Kingdom could mean "great buying power in pockets of potential consumers".
But it is unlikely that the buying power would overcome higher costs in his company, he states.
The costs could affect the JD Sports expanding plans, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
The opponents of the Prague dwelling marshmeloun are shineing.
The controversial building got a footprint.
The investor of Prague Progetti e Investmenti considers the cancellation of the decision to be illegal and will be appealed against it.
Against the building near the Anez Monastery in the centre of Prague, hundreds of people protested in front of Prague's office, there was also a petition.
In the decision, the Magistrate stated that there was a violation of the construction law, as not all the circumstances of the territorial decision were observed.
"The preconditional territorial decision does not contain certain circumstances, such as the kind of land, distances from neighbouring buildings, sufficiently clear and understandably described form of the building, the determination of the territory affected by the impact of the building," it states in its decision.
It also considers that some grounds for decisions have been issued to the originally discussed documentation that has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to occur in the lands of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
According to the written material, however, the land owner has only agreed with the project documentation for territorial management, not agreeing on the location of the building on its lands, the Building Order writes.
According to Francesco August Razett from the Investment Company, the Building Order Committee has not taken note of the decision of the supervised Authority - the Ministry of Local Development, where the time limit for the initiation of the review has already expired.
Anyway, it's a scandal procedure.
"We've been preparing this project for seventeen years, respecting all the laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all the authorities and institutions concerned," Razetto said in the press report.
The project, which, as a result of the proposed fasada color, is called marshmeloun, causes strong emotions in Prague.
In the center of the city, hundreds of people have gathered together to protest against the construction in the past.
The communities and residents of nearby homes disturb that some permits have been issued for a house that would look different years ago.
They also criticize the inappropriate building for the historic center of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Anez Monastery.
The house was designed by the architect Zdenek Franek, the project has changed several times.
The original form of the 2008 project, which counted on a glass fasada, rejected on the basis of the opinion of the National Memorial Institute (NPTP), the Ministry of Culture and repealed the authorisation of Prague Memorials in 2010.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investments with windows into form of faces but the NPTP and the magistrate monuments approved and, on this basis, construction authorisation was issued.
The author of the proposal rejects the lifts of opponents, saying he never counted on the fasada in pink color that gave the project a nickname after a pink-white sugar.
The Czech politics took the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in prison with them.
Berg went to Hungary with a view to bringing humanitarian assistance to refugees.
He took three Syrian refugees along the road with the crew in the car, saying they wanted to travel about a half mile.
He said it was not criminal in Hungary, he claimed to the People's newspapers.
We knew that the lawguards did not understand that.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to the investigation detention in Seget, he described a letter.
Finally, he spent nine hours in the politics cell.
He said the cops were acting correctly, but they had communications because they didn't know English too well.
However, he believed that the prison was triple.
For example, about three times four meters in our cell, 15 refugees from Syria were under pressure.
Among them was a two - year - old boy or a four - year - old girl.
These people were closing the other day, and none of them had any idea what would happen next to them, said Berg.

Metcash starts a rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA trades from Alda's efforts in southern and Western Australia.
Metcash starts a rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 trades in South and Western Australia at the beginning of the next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA mark by marketing in mainstream and social media and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are joined in marks such as Dunsborough based on the ice cream simmo's offering tastes in IGA shops and tradeholders sell cheap tickets to the Australian football liga to local customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the seller of food, alcohol and hardware will celebrate his annual investment strategic day.
There is a lot in the bet because South and Western Australia represents nearly 30 percent of Metcash IGA trade steps and generates a higher turn than Metcash IGA network in eastern countries.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA trades enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in eastern countries.
Anyway, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believes that Aldi will take 5% of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of the opening of the first trades that took the markets from all existing players but mostly independent retailers.
This week, in his report, analyst Morgan Stanley, Tom Kierath, estimated that the IGA retail could lose 360 million USDs on the annual sale and Metcash 250 million USD at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 trades in Southern Australia and 30 in the west during the next year and will generate sales of 500 and 600 million USDs on individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in a solid price base of Metcash could cost him about 13 million USD on tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash loses its share in the markets in the eastern states, especially Aldi and Coles, even though the last survey of Roy Morgan discovered that the shoppingers in IGA were most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that the sales of Metcash will drop by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 and its market share will decrease from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent until 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Hamish Douglass Fund, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, said that trade lunch in Melbourne could "be very likely disappear during the decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Douglas' comment.
But it's known that Metcash member contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA decreased from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010 and the food sales of Metcash, which delivers approximately 1200 IGA retails , fell by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting the operational development of speculation changes because the sales and profits are under pressure.
Nevertheless, the large trade went into an attack and invested more than 150 million USD a year to compare the pulls prices in Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products every week and helps the IGA re-equipped trades by adding rapidly growing food and news from privates.
The Executive Director Metcash, Ian Morrice, argues that the price comparison and equipment programmes will catch the fall and hopes that the generosity will return to the primary profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia Steve Heally
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves glory for his behaviour rather than criticism.
Thanasi Kokkinakis became a side loss in the recent vision of his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his conduct rather than the criticism, states President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented dua often called "Special Xs", drew unwilling attention to himself because of an affair with the unfamiliar Kyrgios and Stan Wawrink at Montreal Masters.
Soon, in a passionate qualification struggle in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison must have been twice separated by the judge, then Harrison said, "Wawrinka had to drag one to Kirgios, and I should have dragged him too."
While he was last seen breaking a missile after the screwed the potential for Richard Gasquet to US Open, Kokkinakise was intensely defending Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second two games at Bernard Romic in Davis Cup Semifinal against Britain.
"I've been very intensely thinking about that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little overwhelmed in the whole dispute," Healy said.
He destroyed the missile when he lost because of the screaming in the U.S., but he's not the first player who would frustrate himself by frustrating himself. I know Thanasi pretty well and I can say that he's not gonna be proud of this event.
But he was seriously controlled very well because he was exposed by a very provocative circumstances in the United States because of Harrison and so on, I think, he deserves a great recognition.
He's got a fantastic team around him, and he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard with him.
He's a very adult 19-year-old man, working very hard and in the team he's getting great and so on, he's never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he's in an amazing condition, it's a very stable and mature young boy and I just think he deserves to be judged by his own credit.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgiose because of the important match that begins on Friday, and states that "the mutual decision" is the right solution for all, but supports the Canberra family to return to the team as a long-term stand.
"Or first, we want our team to be completely focused on the fight, not on all the controversy that came around him [Kyrgios]," Healy says.
And I think Nick was getting up very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people show, in the public's eyes he's growing rapidly, he's also made a few terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time outside the explanation, when he's able to think about it, it's the best solution for the team and for him alone.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the notification of Hungary's threats on Tuesday, it closed its south border with Serbia and held those who tried its illegal cross-border in order to stop the fluid of migrants.
There was chaos on the border, while hundreds of migrants gathered in the country, and the Serbian authorities responded riotly.
Those who are stuck for an unknown time on the belts of the country between the two states stand against violence in their native countries, build accommodation and reside.
But the feelings of frustration come.
When a helicopter flys over them, migrants together call "Open the Border!" and provide regular Hungarian police units.
Some deny food and water for the protest.
Serbian Foreign Minister declares that it was "unacceptable" to send refugees back from Hungary, while they are increasingly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just an indirect injury.
During the next days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," Ivica Dacic says in Prague.
The disturbance at the Hungary-Serbian border came a day after the 28-country block had not arrived with a united immigration policy at continuing meetings in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people looking for protection in surprised Italy and Greece and to speak with hope of reaching an eventual agreement next month or at the end of the year, which more than 120,000 other refugees, including Hungary, would accept.
The German Federal Officer Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special EU summit on Tuesday next week to discuss a continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not turn her hope on Brussels or his neighbors.
The Tuesday situation of threats in the two Southern regions gave the authorities a greater power to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close roads and expedite asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Shijarto said that his country also plans to build a fence from a steel along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country when the fence is now completed on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata announced that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped to pull a steady wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom fled from Syria and other Middle East countries.
However, the President of the Government, Victor Orban, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who follow better life, not war refugees looking for protection, which is a view that is clearly different from the other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that have entered into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize the violations of 4 meters of the fence which the government has left to be built on the south border with Serbia, and also establishes longer terms in prison for those who translate refugees illegally.
"Thanking the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of threats," Zoltan Kovacs told the reporters in the South City of Szeget.
We have absolutely clear in this: illegal crossing the border is a crime.
Technically, Parliament must continue to approve the establishment of the army that was expected next week, but the reporters of the Associated Press on the border have observed a heavy armed army with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, advisor of Orban for domestic defense, said that the authorities caught 45 people who tried to cross the border and caught 15 already in the territory of the state.
They've been invaded by damage to the fence and are now accused of committing offences under new laws.
The officials quickly let the fence fix.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a car covered by the wire.
The main border crossing in Rosk was chaos because the Hungarians opened a small office in the metal container for processing and a human pressure was created.
About 20 of them got inside, but thousands left outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main road linking Serbia and Hungary when they rejected food and water until they were allowed to cross the border to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's invasion before Bernie Sanders decreased by half in national voting
Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton still holds a two-digit step in the Democratic Nomination Race at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is reaching its success.
Clinton is now supporting 47% of the democratic primary voters (declined from 58%), while Sanders is secondly 27% (rost from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who is currently going to announce whether he will become president, receives support from 15 per cent of the democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competition, no more short voters claim that it is too soon to say that there are clear decisions that candidate will support.
But the Clinton sponsors are more sure of their choice than those who support other candidates.
From the CBS News survey last month, Clinton lost the ground under her feet in several demographic groups, while Sanders won several.
Clinton keeps a great step between women and mitigates, but her leadership is steady.
Her support among men has been significantly reduced and Sanders is only 5 points lost to her.
The advantage of Clinton with the democratic voters under 50 years has disappeared, and they are now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has a great leadership thanks to the senior voters.
Last month, Clinton had a two-digit elevation in front of Sanders between liberals, but now Sanders was losing only five points in this group.
Approximately half of the democratic primary voters across the states say she would enthusiasticly support Clinton if she had become a party candidate.
The quarter would support it with certain exemptions and another 15% would only support it as a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It's probably not a surprise that Clinton's current enthusiasts are particularly inflammated because of it.
The views are mixed between those who are not currently supporting Clinton - just about a quarter would enthusiasticly support her.
While 48% of the democratic primary voters say that they would enthusiasticly support Clinton, less republic voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton's favorites are asked in an open question why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), it follows that it is time to be a woman (13 per cent), and that she is the best candidate for this work (10 per cent).
Clinton's favors also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
There is also a great possibility of choosing and matching problems.
While the Vice-President considers the potential candidacy for the president, 57% of the democratic primary voters would wish that a third of them should not be running.
When primary democratic voters were asked, who would be chosen as a second choice for the nomination of the party, the most common choice is Biden.
Between Clinton's fans, more than half Biden as their second choice, far before Sanders.
If Biden decides to nominate the nomination of the Democrats, the leadership of Hillary Clinton will expand from 20 points when Biden is running, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win in general elections; but this number fell from 78 percent of last month.
Biden is far more than the second, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely selectable is increasing.
However, when a candidate is more important, democratic voters prefer solutions to problems before a greater chance of election.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate has become an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some key characteristics between the primary voters of their party.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustful and think they have strong leadership qualitys.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of the democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and reliable, that is, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion on it.
Primary democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
As regards all these standards, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
As the questions regarding the decision of Hillary Clinton on the use of her personal e-mail and the server as the state secrets continue, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with its explanation of this matter and say that their overall view of it has not affected her at all.
But between the American public, it's a totally different story.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third is satisfied.
The views of the public on this topic have been divided in March shortly after the problem came out.
Most Americans claim that this e-mail controversy has no effect on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent of their opinion on Clinton has deteriorated.
It's mainly about the Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claims that their opinion on Clinton has deteriorated.
Although Clinton is considered honorable and confident among the voters of her party, this question is still a problem between registered voters in total: only 32 percent see it as honourable and confidential, which is down by eight points of last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trusted.
At the same time, 55 percent of the registered voters around the country also do not see Trump as an honest and trustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump have good lead marks.
Of six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush were best managed in honor.
Sanderse sees more people as honourable than unfair, but, like Carson, many voters didn't think of him.
The rate of errors in sample 351 primary democratic voters is 6 per cent points.
Ben Carson ended up with Donald Trump in national elections
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times
Two candidates are responsible for half the voters in the latest survey and the others are allowing for support.
The voters from a number of republicans around the country continue to support Trump with a violent majority, and have emerged from 23% of the last CBS survey carried out before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The survey also discovered that Carson has been running well across demographic groups, and is exposing Trump among universally educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field except Carly Fiorina and Governor of Ohio John Kasiche, is at the back of the wisconsin governor Scott Walker, with 10% support, falling at the current 2%.
Former governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florid Senator Marco Rubio are all in the third place with 6%.
The rate of errors in the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest survey is plus minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week has shown that Carson has improved and has achieved 19% of the support between the Republicans for Trump 32%.
The latest research from ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
During the rising trend of Carson, Trump decided to shoot blindly on the neurosurgeon in the service, and even Carson apologized for the interrogation on Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump declared last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died during the overloading brotherly ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, he was charged with murder against five people.
The members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brutally attacked Chuna "Michaela" Denga during the September 2013 ceremony and late took him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police announced.
The policeman states that he had bound eyes, had a bag full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds and was repeatedly disturbed when he tried to reach the target over the frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about the headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the P Delta Psi did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and they reportedly waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, the police claimed.
However, they have found time to change Deng's dresses, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the whole state president of the brotherhood, and ask him for a council, Chris Vagner said to the press conference.
"In this moment, members began to hide equipment and basically prefer the well-being of the brotherhood from Michael Dengo's life," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be recovered and died the other day in the morning.
According to the report, Deng was repeatedly hit by a stupid object into the head, the body and the belly.
"Too many families have been demolished as a result of overlap in brotherhoods and at least one student dies every year for overload since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, wrote in the statement.
Brotherhood and their members must be responsible and this step is important by the authorities.
The great jury of Monroe County recommended charges for the murder of the third degree for the first five members.
Twenty-two other members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Menga, will also be accused of attacks by overloading and criminal communities.
"We want to hold not only participating, but if there is a organization that has approved it, whether officially or not, we will also ask them to be responsible," Wagner said at the Tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned brotherhood and national brotherhood cancelled its relationship with local branches.
This will be states when the Fed increases interest rates
The growth of the rates will come, and the bull market will qualify, the debt receivables will rise and the economy will slip into the recess.
We know all of this.
What we don't know is how long it takes and how long it will take.
For the economy, it offers a history of a small source of time.
The recession arrived 11 months after the first increase in rates and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve System in increasing rates is often, although not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That is why US Central Bank officials emphasized so strongly that the investors should not be focused on the time when the rates will be raised, but rather on traictors, as long as normalisation will take place.
There are really more variables in the game.
However, the market members may eventually make sure that all the calls for increased speed can be excessive.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will be inevitably interpreted by some as the end of the era of cheap money," said Julian Jessop, head of the global economy Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect the progressive return of American interest rates to the more common but still low would create a seismic shock that many could be afraid of.
That means that there will be adverse effects.
Here's the view of how some areas of economy will react, based on historic trends:
Given what the market recorded in the last month, the expected increase in rates can make the air a little steady.
But once the increase comes up, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"The trend seems to be for re-stop action after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in currency policy," said the Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed's increase.
More specifically, the market for the last 35 years is often the most - about 14 percent - aims to increase rates in relatively flat within 250 days (average increase of 2.6 per cent), and then returns to normal state after 500 days, with the average profits of the last six cycles 14.4 per cent, according to the recent analysis of Bob Doll, the main share strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said that the impact on shares has a tendency to become more significant later in the rate increase cycle and return is starting to decrease.
Recession is a real economic life, but the increase in rates often helps it.
The Fed is currently facing certain conditions that have not yet existed and which could speed up the recession.
The most remarkable is that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point in history in increasing fede rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during 118 increases of rates since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP increase was below 4.5 per cent.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 it was 3.6 per cent, it was few to expect its maintenance when it was only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, Atlanta Fed said.
Increasing rates in this complex economic background could be risky and might arise the question: "Is this time different," Deutsche said.
The market participants were prepared for the growth of the Federation all year, and all their eyes turned to the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economies believe that FOMC could approve growth at this meeting, future trade indicates only 25 per cent of the probability.
"In our study since 1950, all cycles of elevation have already been in the super-cycle of increases in the packaging effect with the GDP covering the top of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the starting recovery," the report says.
On the contrary, this was clearly slow recovery from the worst recession during the sampling period.
The current cycle is far the longest of the Fed's expectations since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, we are now on 74 months and we continue.
A strong profit was also volatile, as the market expects an increase in rates, and the pattern is a bit similar to what shares experience.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in bonds than in stocks when the Fed changes the policy direction.
Bonds appear to change the dimension immediately after the first arrival of the cycle of increase/reduction.
At the end of the rise cycle, debt receipts fall immediately," Deutsche said.
The Strategs of Charles Schwaba believe that an increase in rates will lead to an increase in profits between long- and short-counted bonds, which is equal to the curve.
Duties with high profits often work better in this climate, even though "we are still careful about the rental," Kathy Jones, a firmly analyst of fixed retirement in Schwab, stated in her analysis.
It's interesting that Jones thinks the markets are already adapted to the expectations of the Fed policy.
"Besides the power of the dollar and decline inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of stricter currency policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are upwards, the profit curve is more flat, the credit rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed is increasing the policy.
Generally, companies that carry out most of their business in the United States will win interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
The transnational company with a lot of debts will be worse because the growing dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of action has the tendency to overcome within three months after the initial increase of rates," the Goldman Sachsve analysts reported in the client report.
The firms with strong balances have reached weak balances in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 by a average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital profits, as well as low volatility supplies, have also overcome their thresholds of lower quality in the average of 4 (percent points), respective 3 (percent points).
The debt will become a big problem.
High-percentable companies will lose the most interest rates, said Goldman.
In addition to pure action games, consumers also weigh through a growing dollar.
The company can also see its profits through higher profits, but experts have different views about how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, stated by Member Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Ambassador Andrew Bingham criticised this station for "fucking"
It feels that it's increasingly unrecognizable than its commercial rival
He also focused on BBC Music Awards and says that they just cheat the British.
The messenger Damien Collins attacked the Voice and said he's not the original idea.
BBC Radio 3 is "change" in Classic FM, claims the front messenger and accumulates fresh pressure on the broadcasting to prove that they do something that commercial broadcasts do not do.
The Conservative Ambassador Andrew Bingham also told the heads of BBC that the radio station of public service seemed "deep" and is increasingly unrecognizable than its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I hate to use the word "cluttered" - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, started in December last year.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are two examples that attack me, when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," Mr Bingham said.
The Director-General of the BBC rejected the charge with the reason that BBC Radio 3 is far before its business rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to live in music and create music is actually at the top level.
"I also think Radio 3's commitment to find new music and putting into new works is also very important," he says.
At the beginning of this year, the BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argumented that it is now necessary to work harder to involve the audience than before, because the British are less educational about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the production of BBC that got under fire because of screwing on the firing of commercial competitors during the broadcasting of Culture, Media and Sport and got to hear the committee.
Conservative Ambassador Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talp Media for estimated price £22 million.
Do you see why this program is discussed as an unoriginal and no different one?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars of Paloma Faith andBoy George as judges - was made "type of BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation "to find a hit from her own stair" next time he starts a fun series.
Nevertheless, he refused to exclude orders for more future series of the The Voice series or the cost of money for license taxes to other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales grow at the lowest rate since August and on the guilt can be Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 recorded 7% increase in online sales
Last month, the lowest growth has been recorded since 2000 the records themselves began.
Internet sales have been strengthened three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be the cause of braking the spending.
For more than decades, virtual shopping on the rise was making many British main streets cities of ghosts.
However, experts argue that there are signs of online sales stability, and new data show seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the 2000 measurement itself, with only 5 per cent increase in comparison with the last year.
Experts argue that there are signs of online sales stability, and new data show seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the growth level in the past years and go back to 2000, the state has always been rationalized in time," Guardian Andy Mulcahy, the IMRG Market Index editor, states.
It explains that Internet sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to buy.
It meant that people were able to buy online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the couch.
But now (increase) is somewhat staggering, so it seems to be recognizing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken from America, is quoted as one of the reasons for the decline in sale.
Experts believe that customers may be able to delay their purchases before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times more than the average of the buyers turned on their computers to arrange for shopping and collapse several sales websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which allows buyers to recontract, can keep customers from other shoppings
The study published by British Retail Consortium found that only £1 of each £5 was spent online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of the sales are carried out through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion sales.
Muslims buried the victims of the fall of the jarber in Mecca and the Bin Ladin family was sanctified
The bodies of 29 dead were transferred by the streets of Muslims during the first funeral in Mekka
Saudi Arabia partially blames for the collapse of the constructive magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health stated that a total of 394 people were also injured after the jarberry crashed.
Thousands of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the fall in the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Somehow dressed in white, mourning chose their way and gave up respect for the victims, when the first of the fallen came to his last trip to the cemetery in Al-Moaiss.
The sad message was passed around the holy place, where only a few days earlier the building jar broke the ceiling of the mess and dropped on the believer.
The bodies were released for the funeral, and the Saudi king sanctioned the construction group of the bin Ladzina family over the disaster that also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 dead after the fall of the jarber in Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried in the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first patch when the jarbage broke down.
Mr. Akram was in Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the year's lounge.
Saudi officials have already promised that mecca will take place and thousands continue to go down to the city.
King Salman stated today that Binadin Group shouldn't have left the arm on top when he wasn't in operation.
The Arab version of the declaration, noted by the State operated by the Saudi press agency, states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of falling.
The English Disk Agency did not report this details, but stated that the heads of the company were prohibited from traveling to abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman promised to disclose what caused the fall of a jar into the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims converged before the Hadge liaison later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued any statements of a collapse of jarber and were not available to its representatives for comment.
The Royal Declarations also charged the group for not using the latest security measures and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
The dozens of jarbers are surrounded by Grand Mosque in Mekka, which is part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladi's family has been close to the Saudi Arab ruling family for decades and operates large construction projects.
Late leader Al-Kaida Usama bin Ladin was the son of a apostate whom his family denied in the 1990s.
Havaria became in the middle of a strong wind and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the Kingdom on the journey, which must be graduated once in their life by each excellent Muslim.
The officials state that 158 people remain in the hospital.
The officials decided that one million riyals (EUR 174.000) will be dedicated to relatives of the killed, and the same amount for permanently injured.
Other wounds will receive half of this amount.
Boss B&Q claims that Eastern Europe's traders who work cheaply already on trends
Britains are increasingly employing employees, Veronica Laura claims
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is at a point of growth
The result is opened 200 Screwfix trades aimed at traders
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q outlets across the country
Processed Rupert Steiner, main correspondent for Daily Mail
They say the British are putting down the hammers and the brushes and handing them to employed eastern European employees to work at their home.
If you're doing this with a painter or a painting brush, it seems you're in minority today.
Because the British are increasingly employing employees to carry out boxing work at their home, according to Screwfix B&Q head.
Veronique Laury, a new executive director Kingfisher, owning a chain for domestic needs, claims that a large increase in the number of trained traders from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
The result is that Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix trades aimed at traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury says she wants to hire more women in the B&Q shops, because eight of the ten shopping decisions in the store do better halfs.
The majority of men's gender workers are currently.
She said there is a need to address growing demographic trends that show more women's households that are more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Mrs. Laury says, "She's still working most men in our shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
In fact, half of our customers are women that make 80% decision on the purchase of goods.
Women play a great role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laura, one of the only five women in the FTSE100 FTSE100 ruler's controllers, also restructured her top team to reflect the equality between men and women's directors.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having a half representation of women among employees, including the executive and financial directors.
Mrs. Laura says, "It was a conscious decision - diversion is an important theme here.
So it wasn't hard to find the good women we could take to us.
Kingfisher announced the failure as a profit in the mid-year and sale after the group took on the closing costs.
The Kingfisher trend owned by Screwfix and B&Q is to open 200 new shops
The December contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is in danger.
"It is justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Vice-President TOP 09 Miroslav Kalusek, who emphasized the principle of credit.
The President of the OPS Resident Stanjura noted that the single contribution sounds good, but it would be better for a long time to be in standard valorization, because it would be proven until the next years.
"We have space to find the mechanism we're going to deal with," stated Stanjur.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marks (CHSSD), according to which the law should be valuated next year.
Marks defended the grant by the argument that she would improve the social situation of pensioners, which, according to her, was not pink.
The higher valuation next year would mean the budgetary impact of 5.5 billion crowns and ministers will debate about each hundred million.
Prime Minister Boguslav Sobotka (CSSD) reminded the right that the rate of valorization in the past decreased.
The rapporteur Miroslav Opalka (KSCHM) noted that the proposal does not solve the reduction of real pensions in 2016 and later.
Veto's right paying in December will significantly complicate and perhaps even impaired, he said.
The Chairman of Members of the ČSSD Roman Glasnak therefore proposed a shortening of the deadline for the negotiation of the standard in the Committee for ten or 20 days, also blocked the right.
But the Committee will have a month instead of normal two.
Bonus should be worth a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
Money should be made mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
In the next year, the pensions should increase in the average of approximately a stocoron.
The contribution should be received according to the pension novel of people who will be entitled to retirement or part in December.
It could also be obtained by those who had disappeared on retirement in December before it was paid.
However, they would have to request the supplement in writing, at the latest by the end of the next year.
Pensions in Czech Republic are regularly valuated to January, about price growth and a third of real remuneration growth.
This year corresponds to 41.5 per cent of gross remuneration, which should be 40.5 per cent next year.
Last year, the State issued 314.7 billion crowns on an older retirement, which was approximately five billion intermediately.
Expenditure for old pensions represented 26 per cent of all expenditure in the budget and 46 per cent of all expenses obliged by the law.
The average full old pension last year increased according to the data in the State Final Account by 104 to 10.714 crowns.
The Czech Social Security Management provided payments of 2.4 million full old pensions and approximately 17.000 relative pensions.
Yakunin abandoned the political career plans, will be devoted to science.
The senate chair had a billionaire according to the Russian media so sure.
In the Federation Council, the Western Kaliningrad area, whose governor Nikolaj Cukanov as the candidate of the Government of the United Russia, was to be represented in the Sunday elections with a review.
According to Russian law, Senators do not choose citizens, but they are elected by the governor of three candidates whose names will be announced before the Governor's elections.
After the elections, the senator from three candidates will choose himself.
The complications for Jakun was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad area for 20 years, as required by the law.
Although Kremel found the exception for Jakunin that he is an extraordinary and authorized Ambassador, on which the legal requirement of long-term stay is not applied.
The Czech comedy Theory Tiger's finished.
The last drop in the aim of the main hero is the voluntary death of his dog, who has been exhausted from strength and patience.
Grandma - Iva Janjour decided about her grandfather's life, ages and funerals.
John is clear that he and his wife Olga - Eliska Balzer is on a similar path.
He will remember that he once had his own will and dreams, wishing to live digniously and freely.
They want to retrieve the government over their lives - and as a solution, he chooses to escape from this real, the Slavik story.
Bajgar wanted a comedial form to catch a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role of Bartosch would be that he was already cooperating with the Invisible Series.
Still, the actor who appeared in front of the camera after a longer break connected to the reconvalescent after a serious illness, surprised him.
We've made a deal three years ago.
I gave him a script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And he surprised me he's probably a screwed sportsman.
He was always wondering where he would sit before he was filming another scene.
This time he ride a bike, climbs and even walks up the hill.
And all of this in the records of the tropical waters, the director's surveillance.
According to Bartosh, women are taking tigers to make him a rabbit through time.
They're gonna get him a little feed, but they're gonna close the door right now so he can't contemplate playing out of the rabbit's tiger.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie, the actor commented.
His wife, who may affect the audiences mildly negatively, created Eliska Balzer.
She's not just a negative figure.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathy, and she thinks well.
But at the same time, she's a Uzurpator, and she wants to put her husband to death, and Bajgar's.
The film is parallelly similar to the fate of John's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Tanja Vilhelm and Paul Berett - and the zeds Eric and Pepik - Jiri Havelka and Jacob Kohak.
The film producer is Peter Erben from Logline Production, coproducents Czech Television and Radio and Slovakia.

Azerbaijan canceled Teličko's part of the visit for the criticism of human rights violations.
The Czech Ambassador of the European Parliament for movement ANO Paul Telička postponed the ready fourth journey to Baku, because the Azerbaijan authorities canceled his official visit today.
Baku, according to Telička, justified the EP resolution last week, which criticizes violations of human rights in Azerbaijan and which Telička was a co-autor.
By decision of the Azerbaijan Party, Telička lost the possibility of interviews with official partners and the visit of political prisoners depending on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in its press statement.
The road, which was planned several months earlier, Telička wanted to use to meet the leadership of Parliament and the executive representatives, as well as the representatives of the democratic opposition, disidents and political prisoners, to specify the text sent to the CRC.
The EP resolution condemns "unrespective repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
She called on European representatives to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was approved shortly after the recent judgment of the Azerbaijan opposition journalist Chadzija Ismail, who was initiating the discovery of corruption in government circles.
Russia does not exclude that it builds its air base in Syria.
Bogdanovski did not exclude the Russian air base in Syria in the future.
We don't have that plan yet.
But nothing's excluded, he said.
Russia has already had an old marine base in the port of Tartus, which has been used as a service and logistics center so far.
According to Russian press reports, from the beginning of August, Russian weapons and military materials have risen to Syria.
According to Moscow, it is an armed shipment resulting from valid commercial agreements.
Pentagon claims that the Russians are planning to establish a airline in Lataki, which remains the garden of Syrian President Basar Asada for now.
But Washington does not have the specific military intentions of Russia in Syria clearly, according to the American commentators.
The US Foreign Minister John Kerry talked about the situation in Syria on Tuesday with Russian colleague Sergej Lavrov, it was their third telephone interview in the last ten days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu will be sent to Moscow to translate anxiety about the collection of the Russian arsenal near Israel.
The speaker of the White House Josh Earnest marked Asad's support for the loss of the bet.
On the objectives of Russia's policy in Syria, he declared that they were rather incorrect.
According to him, Moscow made its satellite.
He said it could mean that President Vladimir Putin was following a rather long-term goal, but which, which, according to Earnest, is not quite clear.
The war in Syria is to be, according to today's speculation of the Russian press, the main topic of Putinov's speech at the coming meeting of the United Nations Vale Meeting in New York.
The situation in Ukrainian Donbas said the Russian leader is not talking about at all.
According to the New York Times, the US government does not exclude that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian President during the UN session.
But the views between the White House advisors are now broken.
The TASS agency today, appealing to the words of the Kremel speaker Dmitri Peskov, wrote that Putin had no meeting with Obama on its New York stay programme.
Sesame oil put on a limonade diet, the rope helps strengthen the immunity.
The good way to increase the bounty of unsaturated fat acids of these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
All healthy substances will remain in the oil when licking from seed to cold.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diet, such as limbs.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
These are the most common cause of the Czech deaths for years, according to the Institute of Health and Statistics.
Gallant inflammation mainly affects women, helps sesame oil.
If you belong among Asian kitchen lovers, there must not be a sezam oil in your squirrel, which is part of the original recipes for exotic foods.
Unlike most other oils, heat adjustment of food can also be used and has a variety of positive health effects.
It is used frequently in yellow diet.
The essential fat acids that contain are a good prevention of the creation of yellow stones.
Those are 90% of the cause of mushroom inflammation and women suffer three times more than men.
Generally, problems with the limb are affected in particular by people with overweight that do not sport and consume many animal fats.
Sesame oil can be used successfully in the liver diet, which is very similar to the juice.
If people want to use all the health benefits of consumption of this oil, they should be careful about the goods of exotic food shops.
Manufacturers from Asia often use the seeds that have more taste.
But the oil will lose all the active substances, described by Ladislav Hachecki, the executive director of the Czech Czech company, Bohemia Olej, from Kraslic, Sokolovska, which produces biological oils lissed for cold.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unworn white seeds.
In an hour, our liss will be able to figure out 8 pounds of sezam.
Mechanical raw material warms up to 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the labeling extra virgin.
There would be loss of foodstuffs at higher temperatures.
Solar oil benefits from heart and vessel diseases.
The Czech favorite between oil is solar.
The study of Jarmily Hamersky, who led at Masaryk's university, showed that he preferred him in a warm kitchen of 43% of respondents.
However, it is not actually suitable for roasting, but it starts to burn at 180 °C.
For example, it is better to use it to taste salads and is especially suitable in diet where it helps prevent cardiovascular diseases.
Because it contains a high share of omega 6 unsaturated fat acids, which reduce cholesterol levels the most of all fat acids.
In heart problems, attention should be given to the amount of totally accepted fat and calories.
For example, there are 62 calories in one spoon of sun oil, 99 calories in a spoon of rape oil.
As regards the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-calorias.
These are part of industrially modified products.
That's why it's appropriate to touch extra virgin oils.
The sunshine will last like a sesame and rope for nine months.
The storage in the refrigerator continues to continue.
The old oil is especially known by the upper taste.
On the contrary, there's no inflammation on the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
The rope oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of the technique are allocated to so-called super nutrition, and so the rope oil is considered the healthiest of plant oils.
For this label, it owes the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fat acids.
These essenceal fat acids cannot make the body itself and a person has to take them from food.
Especially important is the omega receivement of 3 fat acids.
The study of scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Food has shown that the daily receipt of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume it 0.6 grams, but the Icelandians accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
The rope oil is suitable to put into the dining room as part of the support diet to strengthen immunity and to heal injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People must not be afraid of use of rope oil, do not contain any psychoactive substance.
The fact that this oil's way to consumption confirms that in the Czech Oil company it belongs to the most sale.
It's selling 500 liters a year.
People often use one spoon in the morning.
The rope oil is not delicious, but it will greatly strengthen the immunity, advised Daniel Vlček from the Bohemia Olei cream company.
According to statistics, the Americans are the most vicious nation of barbecues.
There's 1.4 barbecue households.
There are a variety of contests around the world in grilling, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
There's no Czechs in the back.
Based on consumer surveys in the Czech market, we find that only 4% of the people in life did not grill.
The complete majority then grills several times a year.
In order to be successful, we cannot underestimate preparations - it is ideal to adjust the meat by marining a few hours before heat adjustment.
What oil is the most suitable and will keep the health of the beneficial substances while grilling?
Generally, it should be saved with fat during the grilling process itself.
Experts agree that a large number of oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
The healthy extra virgin oils are then lost by the body of the beneficial substances that are differently obtained in consumption of oils of food adjusted at lower temperatures.
It does not mean, however, that extra virgin oils in grilling will not find their use.
A horrible oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When the meat is said, the experts from the Czech Republic Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovska will immediately equip a grape oil.
Because it complements the taste of the meat and of fish.
In the kitchen, the unique characteristics of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for roasting and grilling, because it has a high degree of burning, up to 216 °C.
Even at such high temperature, as one of the few oils preserves the health of useful substances, he describes the benefits of the gross oil Daniel Vilček from the Czech Oil company, which belongs to several Czech producers of this oil from the wine.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high quantity of linol acid and is therefore effective in the fight against the abundance of cholesterol.
In a grape oil, our body also accepts important fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the positive content of these substances, it helps reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive impact on kidneys.
The consumption of grape oil is also helping to increase our external beauty - because it improves the flexibility of the skin, it is used to treat acne and helps to care for dry and broken hair.
The chefs commend the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for the preparation of cold foods, for example in tasteing salads, but also for heat adjustment of food.
So the grilling can be used in two ways, in marineing and grilling itself.
By marineing the flesh and the fish, we can keep their soliness.
In preparation of marinada, three components must be present: oil, acidity and spine.
For example, we add acid with apple oct and target the softening of the meat.
The spine adds a meat of taste and oil preserves and delivers the right cut, suggested by Daniel Wolf.
At the same time, he adds that grape oil is directly ideal for marineing, because as one of the few oils, he can climb through dark meat.
So the marine meat or fish are ready for grilling, how do you proceed?
Extra pancake oils are indicated by only a few drops to prepare foods.
The same applies to barbecue.
Some oils are total tabu for this method.
This concerns especially lazy, rope and rape oil, which should not be warmed at all.
Before grilling yourself, you'll have to trip the roast with oil, so you'll prevent the burning of food.
The preparation of the Annexes is also an essential part of grilling.
For the grilled meat and fish, it is practically anything - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend, for example, hot summer salad.
For it you need: • 1 ps of peach • 1 handcuff tissue • 1 cup of cut cup • 1 cup of mixtures of salad sheets • 3 soup spoons of grape oil
Add to the salad meat to the mixture of salad sheets ripped by the handcuff, cut cucumbers and the large cube cut bross.
According to the taste of osolte and oppression, you can also taste the milk chill and soy sauce.
Finally, dig a few drops of grape oil.
For a special taste, then you can suck salad with gently cutted handels.
Distracted sclerosis: It doesn't only matter for medicinal products but also for the will of a patient to fight.
The complicated sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs a number of experts: neurolog, physician, ergotherapeuth, rolog, oftalmolog, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only for treatment care, such as women with sclerosis need consultations if they decide to have a child, the care of these sick are also socially legal advice, recommendations for the adjustment of housing, etc.
However, this is not enough: the development of the disease can significantly affect the patient himself.
The more he will fight with the disease actively, the longer he can work and not essentially change his lifestyle.
As doctors warn, the patience of patients releases the area for disease activity.
For example, it is proven that regular movement significantly declines the time when a sick person needs some compensation aid, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their surroundings do not be subjected to different myths, such as that the disease is automatically leading them to end up in a wheelchair.
This is why a site has been created Take a chance (www.безmytu.cz), which is supported by the ongoing media campaign Take a chance.
The most important person in caring for a patient with a distorted sclerosis is a neurologist.
The sclerosis is used twice as an indication that when the disease starts to be treated earlier, the physician may affect something.
It's because we have medications for a distorted sclerosis in an inflammatory stage when the neurodegeneration process is not so strong yet.
The sooner we hit, the greater is the hope that we can stop the disease and reduce disability, explains the MUDR. Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
It is very important for people with disturbed sclerosis of rehabilitation care, which most often deals with the weaknesses of lower endings or balance disorders.
Patients are working according to their individual needs: to maintain condiction, to improve walk, to strengthen the pale bottom, to reduce swallowing disorders or to improve coordination.
"It is really individual, depends on the specific problems of the patient," says Mr. Martin Kovari, the primary of the Clinic of rehabilitation and telephone health Faculty Hospital in Motola.
While people with a sclerosis suffer from the same disease, it is a little different in every one.
Rehab can't stop the disease, but it can always mitigate its symptoms.
However, movement activity also strengthens the immunity of the organism, which is in the case of a distorted sclerosis.
Another positive regular exercise is that the sickness is checking out what they can do, and it strengthens their self - certainty.
"In practice, endorphines are also flooded, and a person feels good after him," states Ph.Dr. Camila Rásová from the Clinic of Rehabilitation Medicine Faculty Hospital of the Royal Winehouse.
By influenceing the physical site, we act on the limbian system responsible for emotions.
That's how we interfere with the physics and immune processes and stabilize disease, he adds.
"They used to save themselves so-calledly, we know today that they need targeted burden," says Professor PaedDr. Paul Kolar, preferred Clinics of rehabilitation and telephone health Faculty Hospital in Motola.
The purpose of physiotherapy is to keep a person as long as possible, including a working class.
Therefore, physiotherapeuts are cooperating with ergotherapeuts so that each person receives compensation for sewing it to peace.
Many patients also need psychologist or psychiatric care.
They're in a hard life situation.
When a serious illness comes to life, most people shake it.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
He must respond to the great burden - loss of health.
With such a painful soul, we have to follow someone, not to try to take everything on our own bedrooms.
"I'm working with them so that they eventually conclude that even with the haemorrhage can live a full life and that the broken sclerosis does not mean the end of my life," says therapist Renata Malin - Schubert from the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without Prague Latecoere, the airbuss wouldn't fly.
Aviation production is a synonym of precision and advanced technologies.
The new planes are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that someone can't make and process.
Still, next to superprecise, controlled machines, composite compository machines can be struggling into something as common as the peanuts.
In a bubble that reminds the sugar vacuum, the ovens are disguised by the edges of blink parts that have just emerged from the freaking machine.
"No one has found anything better yet," smiles Ivan Dubski, Director-General of Air Door Producer Latecoere, the Czech Republic.
In the area in Prague Summers, the previous Flight is manufactured by complete doors for Airbus A320.
As the only ones in the world, they deliver doors to Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors whose part is composed in Prague also enter the first and higher classes on topboards of the largest Airbus A380 aircraft.
There are also doors full of compositions for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Precision is the main motto here.
Maybe the momentary keys allow the company to organize twice a year.
If the yellow label fails to record the checks, they should explain to airbus or Boeing auditors in the Prague race if the door is manufactured according to the agreed rules.
But the advanced technique has not completely replaced human senses.
There are 1500 nits on one door to A320.
The nitters have to knock out manually.
It takes them two days.
Even according to the sound of the hammer that hits, they'll find out if it's right.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
Nyth can go from zero to 0.13 mm above the surface of the plane.
It's approximately twice the thickness of human hair.
In the control, a number of trained masts will come in.
When the controller crosses a bunch of nails, he knows if there's someone out of tolerance.
Then he takes a precise countercomer in his hand.
Flights had been flying before 1989 the training programme of the L-39 military aircraft.
But in 1991, none of them have been made.
The company must have found new orders quickly.
It was then combined with the European Airbus aircraft producer.
She won the selection procedure for the emergency door suppliers for the A321 model.
Contracts with Boeing weren't so happy.
"We were a small company that then had no enough money for investment and that Boeing could guarantee long-term stable supply," Dubsky recalls.
The doors to the American manufacturer would remain incredible if Latecoere's French group had not participated in the 1999 Prague International Air Industry Association conference.
I talked about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day the meeting with the French began, Dubsky says.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new contracts came with a strong company.
Right in 2000, the mounting of parts of the door for A320.
Three years later, the upper board doors for A380 arrived.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for composition supplies for Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't get to these big orders ourselves.
Maybe we'd do pieces or small parts.
Partners want a guarantee for 20 or 30 years, Dubsky explains.
Last year, Czech Latecoere has reached a turnover over 2.9 billion and profit after taxation of 147 million crowns.
The exclusive position between aircraft producers is not free.
Latecoere has invested 1,5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and qualification certificates for key employees.
Without them, the company wouldn't make any doors to the planes.
To obtain certificates that the production processes meet the customers' requirements, and in the repeated checks they shall be maintained according to the Dubsky millions of crowns.
Production processes are changing each year.
They're more accurate and stricter.
We need to train employees, equip the equipment and reinstat the whole process of certification, Dubsky adds.
The company is now finishing the preparation of the process for squirrel and nicle which will replace human health harmful kadmium.
Although they received the entry from the manufacturer, then they had to adapt technology to the devices or chemicals they used in Prague.
People from Boeing are coming, checking the concept of the whole line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
One set of samples they test themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, drawing closer to the Dubish way they are controlled.
The reward of the Prague company is long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague race today, the production of embryos is down.
For A320, it produces half of the total volume of doors.
Replacement of Czech Latecoere is either impossible for Brazilian or European producer or very complex.
It does not mean, however, that he could give himself any price outside the door.
Part of the contract is a price curve.
It describes how much one door will cost after ten, 50, a steam of pieces made.
The price of a piece still falls to a certain limit.
We need to get into this price sample.
If not, we'll work, Dubsky says.
Half of the hall, where electrical closets are completed for Airbus Airbus A400 M military aircraft, are yet empty.
But he is a symbol of the future.
A new half-workotic line for nitting and mounting doors for an innovated A320 Neo model is built behind the wall.
Naturation will be accelerated and precise.
"That's the trend that the aircraft's mounting takes off," Dubski adds.
The removal is secured.
Airbus reports that airlines have yet ordered 3278 pieces of new A320 model.
Just a few meters next to the line for the complete mounting of the doors for the upper deck A380.
It's a strategic decision of our mother firm.
The aim is to reduce production time and reduce costs.
Full mounting could start in two years, Dubsky says.
However, before that, the company must pass qualification tests, such as for mounting some electrical and electronic devices into the door for the largest Airbus.
The company also bets on further development of production from composition materials.
Besides Boeing, the new Airbus A350 programme should also be involved, which will compete with the US Dreamliner.
"For the company it is a huge loan when it can process compositions, except metal materials," Dubski said proudly.
However, Latecoere is receiving production capacity for food in Czech Republic.
There's no more place in the Area of Letov, where they're sitting.
Before the entrance of the French mother, the company had 180 employees.
Now he's got 800 and in three years, there might be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are in charge of how many hundred new aircraft are ordering airlines each year, they don't have to worry about work.
Although he had orders for a few years ahead, the mother's company of Prague Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay the loans.
Finally, Latecoere was able to talk to the main creditors.
At the end of August, part of the loans exchanged them for shares.
Contributors received an increase in capital by 57.4 million euros of 37.4 per cent.
The company’s debt dropped by two thirds, that is, 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company wrote between the existing shareholders of a new share of 222,9 million euros.
In total, it raised the basic capital by 280 million euros.
However, the whole group comes from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which are 85 per cent of the market share.
The average growth of the procurement is expected by four per cent per year until 2017.
In the book, he has orders for 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to four years of production.
The French media claims that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the pockets.
The Czech Race in Prague Summers is important for groups.
16% contributes to the Group's sales.
According to the number of employees, he is the largest foreign branch of the group.
The Members supported a larger share of carbon fees.
The change in the taxes for non-gross taxes will bring to the state treasure 427 million crowns more than in 2013.
The revenues of the municipalities should have a neutral impact according to the government, as the fee should be higher.
In the predloń year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns and a state budget of 150 million crowns.
Of the brown coal, there were about 200 million crowns and 66 million crowns of the state.
Novela also counts the increase of the remuneration from the gaining space with a permitted load to thousand crowns per hectare per year.
Receipt of these refunds shall continue to belong to the municipalities in full.
The Minister of Industries Jan Mladek (CSSD) told the Members that the community would gain a year instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of fees shall no longer be fixed by the law, but it is set by the Government by its regulations.
Reimbursement shall be calculated as a quantity of quantities of quantities of unravel and rates for individual species of non-roasts.
According to the government, amendment, inter alia, is the cause of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, the Member of OS Marek Benda warned that the provision of a tax in accordance with the Regulation of the Government must not be in accordance with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Youth, it is not about taxes in this case, because the state is paying payments to the nursery that is a state property.
Expenditure shall only be received by the municipalities whose territory are subject to the burden.
In the case of depth carbon, three quarters of money will be given to the community and a quarter of the states.
The same ratio will be in case of radioactive mines.
The part of the money he chooses to pay charges will be purposely bound.
For example, 28 percent will have to repair damages after retail or to ensure the Banja rescue service.
Today the proposal was criticised by the opposition Members, who, in particular, claimed that they would harm the municipalities affected by the burden and districts.
For example, Michal Kuchera (TOP 09 and Starships) warned that the firms would no longer want to sponsor the municipalities, as they would have paid higher fees directly to the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunne one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kadner (Uswit) chosen in the Ustec region.
Before the increase of unemployment on Mosteck, the Member of KSCHM Han Aulical warned.
Kadner and Aulique failed to propose a novel to reject, Kuchera wanted the law back to the government to work.
The reasonable report states that the increase in carbon prices does not result in taxes, as more than 90 per cent are long-termly contracted.
Therefore, the main consumers like electricity or thermals should not feel the price growth.
"But, on the other hand, this fact increases the risk of increasing reimbursements to compensate for the effort to reduce its operating expenditure, which would mainly mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in employment fees is profitable.
According to the rapporteur of Roman Milan Urbana (CSSD), it is crucial for Members to know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and mainly the government's decision on carbon limits.
If the coal is to go beyond the limits, then it will have impacts on the remunerations for the State and the community, he stressed.
The Urban disagrees with the Youth in the fact that the decision to break the limit at the bottom of the Czech Slovak Army should fall until 2020.
The limits at the bottom of the CSA should be broken according to it for social, national economic and long-term stability of the country's energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching the US Federal Reserve meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision whether to increase interest rates for the first time after nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economies based on the agency Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they would remain inactive for a while and leave interest rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event, because it's been seated years since the Fed's rates were reduced to zero.
For the first time, we get closer to the situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of the zero patch and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of Peterson's Institute for International Economics.
The American economy has done quite well, there was a recovery in the form of adding trillion dollars to the state account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, Fed cannot ignore a less pink global perspective.
They warned markets to be prepared to increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great chances against this step.
The decision should be notified on Thursday 20:00 SEH.
The shooter at the Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday -- and later the same day as his colleague -- wrote a message in which he claimed that he was "summer" of the first murders and wished to take it back, revealed on Tuesday the government authorities.
The Gautier Police in Mississippi stated that Lamb, a geographical teacher and social science at the Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around 10 a.m.
And he said he shot someone.
The Lamb Dispatcher asked him to send a cop to his house.
He said, “I shot my wife last night, ” and he also mentioned that there was a “sweet dog ” in the house that“ won’t bother anyone, ” but he is upset.
The police demanded the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was fired.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found the body of 41 - year - old Amy Prentiss and a manually written message from Lamba, saying: “I am so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she's the only person who ever loved me."
After leaving a message, Lamb went 300 miles away to Delta University, where he killed the teacher of history of Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
The dean of the University, William LaForge, said he did not know about any conflict between Lambe and Schmidt, but that “there was obviously something going on in the head of Mr. Lamba. ”
Even despite the Monday statement that Lamb allegedly believed in the romantic relationship of Amy Prentiss with Schmidt, the government authorities stated that there were no "loving triangle" of "no evidence".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss over seven years, said she was a “great person. ”
The divorce happened 15 years ago, but both of them remained friends.
The 19-year-old daughter of O'Steen and Prentiss was "smashed."
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, Sun Herald, worked from the house through the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles heard.
The police said that Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he would not go to jail.
When the cops caught him on the road near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
According to the biography published on the school website, Lamb received a doctorate at the University of Delta on spring 2015.
Stars that have lost their spell
Herec (left), with his son Redmond (right), has several stressing years behind him.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett because of cancer.
The actress also reportedly had a problem with drugs, and in 2008 he was detained for drug holding.
All these things must be choosing their taxes.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United will be out of the game for a few months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during the defeat of Manchester United in the League of Masters against PSV Eindhoven.
While this left defender left this wound in the tears and expelled him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury caused the unreasonable action of Héctor Moren in 15 minutes when the 20-year-old Shaw broke into PSV space.
Nine minutes he was treated on the field and also needed oxygen mask before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double break of his leg and now he's in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps after tomorrow and then operated in Manchester.
It's horrible - a boy who comes to Manchester when he's 18, it's very difficult, but he plays fantastic and then happens this.
When he was in his dresses, he also had a oxygen mask.
Crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg break requires six months of treatment and won't be able to play a group phase.
I believe he'll play this season.
Moreno was very lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalt cop.
The judge Nicola Rizzoli Mexican hasn't punished.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian judge was wrong.
You can consider whether it was penalty and red card.
It was a very ugly act of both legs.
Tweet from Shawa's account says, "Thank you all for their reports, with words you can't express how I'm destroyed, my path to recovery begins now and I'll come back even stronger."
Related: Manchaster United recorded injuries of Luke Shawa in defeat against PSV
The English defender will have added motivation to recover in the form of Europe's championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, coach of PSV, said, "It was a very ugly wound."
When any player leaves the field with such injuries, everyone is very sad.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt the opponents.
Moreno suffered a fracture of his leg in the fight for Mexico against Van Gaal Holland at the world's world championship 2014.
"It's very difficult for him, because his intention was not to injure the players, and when you hear about the seriousness of such injuries, it's not good," said Coca.
I wasn't able to notice this moment.
I only saw the ball that was heading in the other direction, so it seemed to have touched it [Moreno], but I didn't see the act on Luke.
In the interview for SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel really sick of it, I'm very sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital after Chris Smalling's operation.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child loves a book, it doesn't take long to learn how to remember it.
Of course, you can't be David Cameron.
For the question of the children's scheme provider to appoint the favorite child's book, he chose the President of the Government of Lorax, a fairy story of Dr. Seusse of 1971.
It was difficult to choose, Cameron writes in a report published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "A funny, touching, creative and strong content, that's what I liked to read to my children because there was always a picture or a message that I've never seen before."
Well, after that, in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the story of the book according to the lift of 2012, which added additional figures and details to fill in the short original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, the walls where all nature stopped existing, and even the air is a commodity, the boy named Ted hopes to get the hearts of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," is a brief content of the book that records the object of love, Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
It's as if it wasn't suspicious enough, the text added by Cameronom is read as a summary of the film of Lorax, which is located on the web site of the Internet Movie Database, and starts with the words: "In the city of Thneed-Ville, the wall of all nature has stopped existing, and even the air is a commodity, the boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of the girls of his dreams, Audrey."
Because he was openly a practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not meet the story of a book where the most unnamed young man will know that the local nature is devastating the gross, trees of an industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the title of Loraxe, a crushed, whispering creature who "speaks for trees."
With the greatest probability so relatively little PR task has been given a assistant who never read Lorax to the child 20 times in a piece.
The Downing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but without another comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of the remarks of England, but he still keeps it.
To compete with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England has chosen for this tour, I think the repeating of the 3-0 defeat suffered last time in the test series will be unlikely.
I wouldn't exclude the guests directly.
The Alastaire Cooka side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spine players in this packaging composition and also collective thinking are strong; they will not take scars from 2012, only positive.
With the ball is Moeen Ali, developing spinner and Adil Rashid, even though is unknown at the level of the test series, represents an attack option.
Relevant: Adam Lyth dropped out of England's team in the experience of the series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to mention Adam Lyth is a hard nut for me to analyze because his main coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests standed against two good attacks in difficult conditions and simple, but the hard reality is that cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, around the name Joe Root, there were no questionnaires, which led to the announcement, because — and this I've mentioned earlier — the players are their best selectors.
A few more half-centuries later, and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Let's hope that if he can get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The chief coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performance wasn't 100%, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question about how much test time the bark gets to show is a hard nut.
Lyth got seven hats — just like Sam Robson before him — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and outside.
The only reason you could remcate is that England gave the first chance of Jonathan Trott in Caribbean — although Lyth was in the best form — but this screwed opportunity is the past.
Alex Hales is coming and that's the stick I appreciate very positively.
It's a x-factor cricket player we saw here in Yorkshire at the beginning of the season when he got 236 against us at Trent Bridge field, which kind of did.
It must be given at least the same opportunity as his precedents received, but all this will, of course, depend on the total composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea when Moeen starts by the side of Cooka, which would have won another extra spinner while he kept four speeds, was overwhelmed and I have no reservations against it.
I don't understand why the strokemaker can't fire, and this left man has already shown that he is an amazing cricket player.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for her country, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 and there's no big difference in it.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests before his show in 2001.
He did it right away for three centuries, and he did not even look around.
Zafar Ansari is coming to the team as a backup spinner and when I had the opportunity to follow him, he took me up as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his gross statistics — average 31 with a ball and 35 with a ball — but there's not a lot of spinners to raise their hands, and the selectors have decided for youth.
They'll learn a lot about this tour.
Besides the team, England seemed to have made several changes and smart completion of their coach staff.
The name of Mahel Jayawardenea, the Sri Lanka sticker, as a consultant for test matches can be a championship.
He is one of the most beautiful players who bring rich experience by having experience with all conditions and attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in a part of the White-ball tour and brings to the team both energy and ruthless spark.
I always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and as Mahela has an intellectual that can be used.
The new votes in the dressing room, even though the voices say consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes slow down and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's servant Ben Stokes got a single day off, as Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this decision.
Even though many disagree, coaches and selectors do not make a schedule.
And you must remember as players that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken to light weight.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
The unexpected strategy for renegotiating David Cameron for the maintenance of Britain in the EU has been raised into other problems with every last day and without choosing the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn headed by the Party of Workers, or the Tuc will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuc on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crisiss - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have already had enough British egocentric agendas, dividing concessions and disturbing changes in the contract that they mostly did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that they wouldn't want it even if they had a social protection.
We can even call it a selfie agenda of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and Officer attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropoliers, make a picture before a famous local monument, with or without local clerks, and then return home with words that they win allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Unclassified Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that some short-term ministers and officials in some major cities have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, the German cautionally balanced Officer, is an ally, but she was in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as it was for too long as there was Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohla (16).
French François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power also falls.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It's difficult to watch them break their legs by helping Selfia British who can better invest their energy in preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want, because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers can plan intentionally useless notes of the SNP style during the campaign before referendum 2017 in Great Britain to speed up the Brexit process, says a friend.
"Renewing negotiations solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing valuable from negotiations."
The Europeans know how grave the street can be and how skeptical about the EU are the press oligarch barons, because they were not during a referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 in ratio 2:1.
They can remember the name Boris Johnson, an emerging Eurooportunist who made his name as a Brussels rapporteur "EU straight bananas" at the beginning of the 1990s.
Despite his embarrassment, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of dangerous taxes, foreigners hacking phones and the pseudo of the non-Marine department, which owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in the cage with a creepy gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so that she wouldn't take you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum, since Blair accepted the principle of abolished EU constitution, which was flooded by the French and Dutch voters in 2005 and obtained a map of dismissal.
The press has never forgiven him either.
But the dear Jeremy Corbyn, who had a friendly cry on my back on Monday in Westminster -- I told him that he must not waste time on me -- it seems to be in danger of re-entering the strategy of Murdoch Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take a while, but it needs to develop a coherent media engagement strategy, not with me, but surely with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC chair on Sunday.
Corbin's official position towards Europe, I'll say nice, it's developing.
He claims that he wishes to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people out of Ukip's mad trends and the wild shores of Tory's little Englisherism can definitely come up with it.
The same said Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn in the radio and television this week, when his internal scout couldn't decide to admit that Corbyn's name of abrasive McDonnell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 70th year when his old father fought on TV for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's match was much more attractive.
But fighting for remaining "in all circumstances" - Benni's phrase -- it was not what McDonnell said, or what JC told the colleagues and the messengers at their private meeting Monday night,
Whatever the background is, the sensitive image that Corbyn wants to share - remember, he touched me - the discipline of the message remains important in the age of the whole day's television and especially in faith, the parenchage of paranoia and treasons, which are social media
It is fair not to provide Cameron's free ticket to Europe, which would allow him to consider the support of the Party in the referendum as apparently as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic screwing on membership in the EU - in accordance with their Bennite surrounding economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoterical discussion between the left disidents, for which narcissism is a small central dimension of dogmatic habitation.
Just as his screwing on Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end this - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspected voters - because of the concessions of Britain, when it seems useless?
The United States are already quite disappointed in the Britain 's weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the costs of the conservative government in power, as I was reminded at Monday's beginning of something called the British Security Forum.
Experts criticise reviews on electronic publicly published by Public Health Agency of England
The announcement by the government funded by the Agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking, resulted in a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, the researchers state.
Experts writing in British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet criticism of evidence used in their electronic cigarettes by the Public Health Agency of England (PHE).
The PHE issued a report last month and described it as "complex examination of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the volume of data and noted the links between some experts and tobacco industry.
The introductory in Lancet's professional magazine last month attacked the "extremely home base" on which the PHE was based on its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for BMJ questioned the claims that were allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that politics should be based on evidence of efficiency."
They claim that the public could expect that the claim of the PHE Agency, which sounds "the contemporary best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed examination of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people convened to analyse a decision-making (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on damages associated with various products containing Nikotine; the results of the negotiations were summarized in the research report.
McKee and Capewell stated that one sponsor of this meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose Director-General has reportedly previously received funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the public health authority of BAT in the sustainability report, he states.
One of the 12 participants acknowledged the funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, but not the funding that he has reportedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for the selection of members of the panel is not available, but they contain several known champions of electronic cigarettes, some also declare industrial finance in the newspapers.
Some other attendees are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The PHE meeting also attended the tobacco leadership.
The report formed in this group "explicitly accepts", missing "courageous evidence of the harmfulness of most products in most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, no such references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the PHE claim that "not yet exists any evidence that e-cigarettes would act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers," was too early.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Prosperity in PHE, said that the claims in BMJ were already answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two life-living smokers will die because of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks presented by electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to explore long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what they do not show, especially when there was so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people die annually from smoking diseases and smoking costs NHS £2 billion per year.
By emphasizing the current evidence - that even though e-cigarettes are not without risk, they only have a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are filling our national competence.
BBC should end with EastEnders, the former Director Channel 4 claims
Former Director of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voices, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would "to the right hand" for a hit show like Albert Square.
Johnson said that the license fee should be used only for programs not created by other British TV broadcasting.
He criticised BBC for putting public services programs that are likely to be watched by only a bunch of people, in complex broadcasting times against his rivals "the largest rating show, and on channels like BBC4.
After generally director Tony Hall said that the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he was unsuccessfully trying to connect to BBC for the entire six years he was working on Channel 4.
"I fight with the idea that BBC is introducing and sending programs that would certainly be transmitted by rivals without State's contributions," Johnson said in the Upper House Communication Commission, as part of the BBC future negotiations.
If you maintain licence fees that I'm not sure whether in the mid-term or long-term horizon they are a good idea, at least the creation should be reduced as regards programs that do not produce or not.
They're sending The Voices in the main broadcast time because they want to get as wide as possible support to the future.
The idea that no one else would send him is a ridiculous joke, and obviously nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why regressive tax should support programmes that can be financed without contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and clearly produced on homeland.
Honestly, the other channels would put the right hand for them.
I can't understand how these public broadcasts are.
I don't think it would even weaken the BBC.
Johnson, a serial businessman who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC feels guilty by reaching the ratings "for the ambitions of people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to provide long-term support."
His comment on the most popular BBC show repeats those who the former Executive Director of Sky, Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that BBC will sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even more hungry BBC public service programmes "goes to BBC4, where it is quite often not possible to measure the population, but they fill their power and can argument when they are going to their hypocrisy mission justification £4bn from license fees, "But of course, we do all these observations that no one is looking at."
They're sending them when no one's looking at them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson said to the Commission: "I call on you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value of it.
Of course, we all think that 150 British pounds a year is a big sum, but for people who have 150 pounds a lot, I'd be surprised if they pay so much because they don't look so much on BBC.
Former director of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who set up on Tuesday before the committee, said that BBC should revise its reith mission in terms "informate, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that a small volume of BBC production has already been classified as educational - it had been 1% of the TV production and 0.1% in the radio - and should take a model of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "Inform, explain and entertain."
On the theme of the partnership, Elstein said that BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which were only broadcasting on television, and connect to commercial reporters so that we can all see them online.
‘Sonogenetic’ or brain cell control using sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction that the angles move.
Scientists raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Little angles change the direction at the time they're affected by sound impulses that are unacceptable for the human ear.
The pulses function by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to react to these ultrasound waves.
Relative: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists pointed out that these worms are a great show of a new methodology called sonogenetic, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla in California, stated for the Guardian journal that this method could one day replace a deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure with the patient's brain electrodes that stimulate the brain. The method is used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
The ultrasounds usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reactions will be delivered when they are placed in the fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found, bubbles strengthen the ultrasound waves that then pass through the worm body.
The strengthened ultrasound waves operate in ion channels TRP-4, which are located in the membranes of certain worm cells.
The sound waves open and activate cells with which they are connected are reported in the report of Nature Communications.
In order to control the ultrasound waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain ion channels TRP-4.
When he then used such modified ultrasound worms, the sound waves were strengthened by micro bubbles and moved to worms where modified motor neurons were embedded.
The new method is in many ways similar to optogenetics, a pioneer tool that enables scientists to switch and switch neurons through light.
Chalasani, however, was told that sonogenetics could have many advantages against this technique.
Unlike lights which must be sent by the optical fibre to the required place in the brain, ultrazvuc waves may prosecute tissues without limitations and be sent directly to the brain.
“We believe that if we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also be found in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your threshold!
The advertising British weapons trade.
Look at a video on the anti-arm market from Amnesty International.
Terrible killer drones!
Eyes on the legs that break the cords!
Shooting shots!
And electrical closing armors that cause unbearable pain but leave no signs!
The joyful voice and cartoon of metafores do not leave anyone doubts that this advertisement on the world's largest weapons aircraft is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International because of the emphasis of the willingness of the British government to sell weapons to repressive regimes through defense and security facilities International Veselice in the ExCeL Centre in the London quarter of Docklands.

However, a separate campaign is also led by the outbreak of posters at bus stops and metres that require a second view.
"The important notification, Travel to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using the fonts with the marks of the London metro with DLR lines becomes a picture of tank.
This year, in September, the swarm of arms traders will come down to DLR ... Customers are requested to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who expose their work in the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
A collection named Special Patrol Group helped distribute around London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 for a piece of Allen key, which is allegedly "receiving access to about a third of the advertising room of bus stops on the planet."
Transport to London is not confused with this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies made by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, the courier of Cruel Designs and an expert assistant at the Essex University, artists are increasingly arguing and trying to show political activity to the audiences outside the gallery.
Many artists go to work with activists within protest movements and realize that they have to get out in a real world so that their arts can affect society.
Another of the posters against the trade of weapons traveling in the metro.
Video Amnesty was seen on Facebook over 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP agency working free of charge and graphical designer and commentator also worked free.
Creative director VCCP Matt Lever would be surprised by the silent surrounding advertising of arms trade -- he saw an empty place in the ExCeL calendar -- and he thought, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with creating a more realistic risky company advertisement, but "with adding sharp colors and animations, we made it sense that it's going to be more people."
"They took a fantastic piece of work and helped us awake concerns about selling illegal torture instruments in the fair," said Tom Davies in Amnesty.
What we now need is that the United Kingdom government take measures and ensure that the torture equipment is not illegally traded in our threshold.
Hopefully the most creative art surrounding arms trade comes from within ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastic eufemist products.
In the press report, Saab discovered an order from the US Army to "on the AT4CS RS shoulder."
This includes "only protected head, which provides amazing effects beyond the armor within the target."
Whatever it is, it won't be nice.
Eight Gold Rules for Life on Student College
11 years ago, I moved to college as an unrespectable nineteenth-year-old boy who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but until now I think of the tense smiles of those I've been disturbing - and many long-term complaints on others.
Anything I've learned can be destilated into eight simple rules.
Movement to the railway can be moving from slightly to nerves walking to totally disturbing.
It's attractive to talk: to tell people where you're from, if you've taken a year of break, what you're thinking about Corbyn and why "you don't really love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just an extraction from the HAHAHAHA waves, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others also breathe - ask and express interest.
It runs the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and those you wouldn't have talked to even if your ears were in one fire, and they would have issued fireworks.
Leave people space.
The rooms of people often change to drinking reception, film evening places and community public places, but these are also rooms in which people dress and adjust their underwear.
Relationship: Don't even think about going to college and having a relationship
Introverts will just come to college.
Your room should be a shelter, but a lot of railways are transformed into an outstanding walking culture, which is friendly, social and contributes to life's friendship.
It may be hell for someone who needs to be charged.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave to get back to the energy I needed to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socialization - and maybe write him a place of knocking.
When we're talking about knocking, knock.
One boy in my railways used to know that if the doors weren't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends thanks to baking.
Because you started going to the university at the top of baking maniac, knocking on a foreign door and showing with a pay of baked pies seems a little less strange than "Welcome in the neighborhood, something I baked for you, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering homecare is a good way to find friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk to you and perhaps it ends by making your face a tasty surprise.
Of course it's the subject that you're a decent baker.
Wrongly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and thirst will probably stop others pretending to be sleeping if you try to knock on their doors.
The stealing of food is a common crime in college.
Thefting of the whole chicken is of course a crime, but is a drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Check it twice with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're angry inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's boring and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my roommate who exchanged her milk for a washing meal to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't do sounds that disturb people from sleep or study.
It's not just that you're a decent human being, but you're also reputed people in glass houses.
The girl from my hall asked her neighbours if they could have quieted the drum and bass, because they were three nights and in the morning, she had a letter.
Their answer was the strengthening of music.
When they finally shut up at 5 a.m., she let them sleep quietly two hours and then she released her own music loudly, locked the door and left her three-hour letter.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future house was going on the same railway as you?
And on the contrary, wouldn't it be awfully embarrassing if you made a mistake of your roommates for your future house, slept together, broke up and had to see each other every day and maybe she would also take control of your common friends?
Of course, you do not recommend your heart - but if your sexy roommate is not your future house, try at least a little to talk to your weaknesses.
At the exhausting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in his unlocked room, there is only a thin border between joke and joke.
Good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Learn them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by hiding them something - never destroy someone's toothpaste and champon.
Lock their doors and give them the keys to the bottle of water, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eve looked forward to the twins, even though the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva has experienced a cruel moment of pregnancy with this seven - year - old Vietnam.
His daddy broke up with her and she was alone to prepare and raise her.
I was quite quick - I looked forward to the baby and looked for a positive situation.
Not sure, and by being alone with the baby, I tried not to worry.
And I surely had hope that we will not stay alone for a long time, remembering Eve today her first pregnancy.
She met on the Internet at the older Vask chamber, who started talking about the favorite movies.
Your Eve and Vitka even brought home from the family, but he didn't take too much on his dad's role.
"He retreated from the program for a while," Eva described in the fourth series in that 3.
The third row of the Czech TV series is just looking for happiness for the second attempt.
The care of Vitka and the financial security of the family was handled by working on partial jobs and great helping her mother and her aunt.
Even the prospects of responsibility for a foreign child did not eventually defeat your affection for Eve.
They are definitely together around Vitko's second birthdays, and he now understands your dad as his dad and also calls him that way.
Even though Yourk has two adult daughters, parenthood in the sixty is enjoying, and he also gives more attention to children.
Besides Vitka, another two - year - old Leontine girl arrived to them, and eventually even a twin.
"Your family has influered somehow naturally in our family, even if my mother never talked much about my relationship," she thinks, "Eva smiles.
Not enough room?
At least we're close.
The twins of Emma and Ella were born by the Imperial Cut after Eve was diagnosed with pregnancy.
This is a disorders of production and the activity of yellow acids, which then occur in excessive amounts of pregnancy in the blood and are particularly manifested by spraying.
The disease is dangerous for unborn fetus threatened by pre-born and death, mostly inflicted with mother after birth.
Emma and Ela were born healthy to Evin and Vask, even when they were only on 36 weeks.
The emotion was placed in the incubator at the intermediate department, where Váskova's nephew worked, who was able to take her and accommodate.
Elinka was larger and immediately after she was transported from JIP to room, I had her with me, describing the difficult period after the birth of Eva.
She spent twenty days in her family until the doctors agreed to release the babies that were able to reach the limits of two kilos.
Waiting for children in Eve’s family was not a joy.
"I was an insane harassment for my husband and children," she recalls a four-fold mother at the six-week section.
She also considered signing the reversal with her husband, including because of the insensitive approach of one of the doctors.
Eventually, it was not possible, and the doctors released Eve and the twins to housecare.
Stories of four pregnancies and births sends CT1 on Tuesday night at 21:45.
A total number of families can be humiliated.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to have enough electrical two-board and collapsed conditions.
Although the house has not increased, Eve was happy to mount a gas cook so that the preparation of food for six people was more comfortable.
If it's the best, we'll get a cab.
Eva is convinced that children are particularly perceived by family comfort and a pleasant atmosphere, not the size or mixture of the house.
So far, we've been composing too well, better than we expected.
Although the mess is hiding worse in a small space and we sometimes cross the babies, but at least we're all close, Eva smiles that can find a positive page for every situation.
Washkov's work of the lighter in the movie is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes travels to Prague streets as a cab.
In his sixty years, how long will it be, according to his words of care for the finance of the family and children?
"I realize that, in view of our age difference, I will once be the one who will feed this family," she admits Eve to a flat questioning the future.
She would like to go back to work, but even more attracts her the possibility of her own business.
I'm not exactly a jober with four kids.
And if it's the worst, my husband and I can take care of a cab. She's kidding a sympathetic blonde.
Apple's got a jo-jo effect.
It's all for the screens.
The more executive processor, a camera with a larger resolution, a stronger chase or a display that recognises the touch force, are shortly the advantages of the recent iPhones of the ninth generation.
These two last also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Because Apple's current trend was that every new generation of iPhone is easier than the previous.
The exception was only third and fourth generations whose weight was slightly increased compared to the previous iPhones.
The two-gram difference in the inexpendence of the news was really negligible.
However, this is not far from the new iPhones.
In contrast to the iPhones last year, 6 and 6 plus, the weight increased in a smaller model by 14 grams, with a larger of 20 grams.
One side cannot be surprised, last year, the Apple's affirmation in the pockets has suffered significantly.
The Chasi News is so of a resistant aluminium compound of 7000, which has also been produced on the weight.
But it's much more affected by displays.
The Apple used the 3D Touch technology for the news to identify the power of touching displays.
In this regard, the display was required to provide another layer of capacity sensors.
The mass of the new iPhone displays thus increased more than twice compared to previous generations.
In smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams per 29 grams, in case of larger from 19 to 40 grams.
So the iPhone 6s display is the hardest used component.
The materials of only 143 grams are then achieved in this news also by the defying core that touched most of the remaining components.
In the largest model, then, the hardest battery element used, but its weight was not changed against the precedent.
Even in this case, the biggest growth is seen at the screen.
Weight 5,5" iPhone 6s Plus is 192 grams.
As long as the new technology of the display will be practical, it will be shown until it is used.
The first users will be able to test it on Friday 25 September, when the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will be started in the chosen countries.
Is the breakfast breakfast of champions for tens of thousands of years?
In the Italian Grotta Paglicci, the archaeologists have managed to find that opens interesting options.
They discovered traces of accommodation by a modern man of different times, including wall paintings, remnants of instruments, and so on.
In a layer of 23A, which is given by instruments up to about 30,000 years ago, but scientists have discovered but something very similar to the rest of the breakfast buffet.
Because there were traces of owse grain that appeared to be through the process of production of so popular cloths today.
The grain is weakening today, then drying, riding the pack, the so-called plug, then spinning and dissolving the surface.
In the cave of Paglicci, the grain that was allegedly warm or sparked, and then apparently smashed between two millstone stones -- at least that indicates the traces of the use of two stones in the cave.
So the scientists could not prove in their publication for the PNAS magazine that the cave would be conducted by a complete process of the production of cloths, but the similarity is really very impressive.
We don't have any evidence of how people can eat, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and perhaps a lot of warmness, of course, makes it very logical.
At the same time, this is a very interesting evidence of how people used cereals intensely long before farming.
For if the fibre interpretation is correct, the oldest sheets have preceeded agriculture for approximately twenty thousand years.
New report of stations in the Transport Unit of Brna.
So I once again listened to the names of the stops in the trolaybus: gross, Ghost, Frazova, Sprateck.
Of course, the trolejbus was a little more loud, so the reporting by a male voice was a little less understandable than before when the stops were announced by a woman's voice.
The woman's voice is higher, so in a deeper noise of traffic movement it is better recognised than a deeper male voice.
The DPMB claims that this voter was chosen by passengers themselves - I don't know who, no one asked me, but it was certainly chosen from the studio recordings taken in absolute silence, which, of course, sounded quite different than the bus engine rumour.
I've been living in Brna for a nice couple of decades, so the correct names of all those stops I know remember, so I don't need this report, but the strangers from the other hand who don't recognize in Brna and for which these reports are primarily designed can be confused and can be confused at the end where they had accidentally arrived, then claim that the stop they were to come on was not at all.
Perhaps the choice of the voter - but better voters - to do again, and this time undercolored by the normal noise of transport and the motor score, in which the reproductor's knocking in the bus is almost lost.
So that we should not continue to listen to the names of the Water Herspitz, Smirova, or then the Ponor in the scratching shale that I went into in Komarov.
I suppose my old hearing didn't get so much worse all the time during the only day the voter changed.
That day ago, I understood that report pretty well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the trailer records.
Nowadays, few people know what the biggest and smartest governments of the party were so-called complex checks.
I let you remember it.
The bus was late.
I hit the dispatch office at the moment the radio sounded like it's just seven hours.
"You're lucky that you didn't struggle with a comrade chief, came a minute before you, and it seems he's not really in the mood," said the dispatchman while I logged into the book of arrivals.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Write to me that I'm going through the districts to revise a tiny mechanism.
It's not gonna work. There's checks today.
Everybody's fucked up with it, and they're terrified.
What's the matter?
"You'll see," the dispatchman said.
You'll be next time too.
I ran to the hallway.
The doors of the headquarters opened and the chief showed up.
He's tied, with a rock face, in the perfectly falling one.
"Good morning, Chief," I greeted respectfully and quickly turned two buttons on the same jacket.
"Good morning," said the answer, and I quickly ran to the second floor without realizing the cold, creepy tone that the old man answered.
"You're playing," Eva's engineer, the elderly lady I appreciated very much.
He said she was even the chief before her companions brought her down.
There's checks, and you'll come like that.
How many times I asked what the complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it.
He says they're staying once for three years, everyone needs to be with them, and it's pretty unpleasant.
At least for some.
I hear I'll see.
I pulled a fascicle out of the loop with periodic reports and the phone.
"Here Holcman, come to me right now," the chief's voice replied.
What's bothering?
Now we've met and nothing..." I wandered, but no one answered me, everyone with their thoughts.
"Good afternoon, Comrade Chief, I have come to your order," I've emerged, barely entered the headquarters.
The chief was sitting at the desk and looking at some lister.
"Comrade mechanic," he said after a while, without lifting his head and still looking closely at the leaster, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw a leaster on the table, he stood in his chair's back and he looked at me with a common, unpleasant, bad, pickhead view.
I've been unbelievable.
What's going on?
Yesterday, the deputy commended me that I worked very well in these months of office and that he was very happy with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the crew on the distance.
And now this?
You realize you're a technique of the track distance and you have to behave.
Such a greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I felt that I used such a greeting since I was a child that I was raised and that I didn't see anything wrong on it.
For the chief, it was like a red garment for a peanut.
"You're on a socialist railway and the only acceptable greeting is the honour of work," the embarrassed chief.
In addition, you're still screwing up to the chiefs.
Once you say "sir" and the second time "mother."
But I'm not a Mr. Chief for you, but Comrade Chief.
The seniors are companions, the top trailers are companions of the top trailers!
Remember that nicely!
Excuse me, sir... Comrade Chief, but... I greeted you with a regular civilian greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and it's a honour of work, or a companion... you know... I'm not in the party...
"It's not your advantage that you're not on the side," the chief said coldly, which was still a little calm.
We're going to talk about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have the chair upstairs paid for retirement.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his advantage, it didn't seem well with the person concerned.
He stabbed me in a cold, scratched look, and I was looking for words to answer.
I was also frustrated by his excellent ticking.
He was just a few years older and played a lord of god, actually a fellow god.
A giant, drowned, authorised, arrogant, as it was right now.
He's all expelled.
He's a chief.
In fact, not everyone, the president of the party organization as all the parties, but even the non-party, he was ticking him.
But the chief was ticking to many, especially those who could use his superiority.
He just took me out for a full bullshit right now.
I thought about a shit, and it cost me enough to get rid of it so I didn't shoot it in his face.
But I wouldn't even go back to the potato pump, even if I would continue to be an irritating official.
What would I use for two kids?
And that's what the house is!
I was crying, but I controlled myself.
I won't make him so happy.
"That's all yet, you can go," the chief finished the audience and began to look carefully again that he had before in his hand.
I was called in at 18:30.
Everyone in the office was already there and on questions what and how, they answered that yes, that it would be good.
Only Jojin tastefully said how it used to be his habit that they could not throw us all out, because the companion of the chief would have to do this work with his faithful ones, not threatening.
The word "friend" emphasized as if he knew what the old man had to do with me in the morning.
There was a nice meeting in the headquarters.
Comrade chief at his writing table and on a long consultation table, other colleagues who were to decide on my official being or not.
Cadrovak, President of ROH, writer of staff, reference for special purposes, something to look at the way of the war, and the deputy, my boss.
And the most important person, the President of the Party Organization.
I knew him from the stake.
The ordinary railroad worker, undermine the thighs or the viles throws a sculpture.
But also a former guardian.
It was heard that there was no fun with him that time, a pretty beast.
Bad tongues argued that he went out in the seventh grade, didn't learn anything, he didn't know anything.
And when they canceled the crime, he ended up on a stack at the potato.
But, comrade, yes, the colleague was coated!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little baby in my neck, an unswallowable slipper.
Cadrovak read the assessment from the Civil Committee from the place of residence.
I'm from a work family, I'm married, two kids, and so on.
It's good for now, I thought, and I've been breathing a little better.
Then an assessment from the street organization of the party.
He's copied an assessment from the Civil Committee, maybe both of them were written by the same person.
But then it came!
The long-term parents of the party refused to get before the verification committee and subsequently left the party for health reasons.
The chief looked sharply at me.
The caddler noticed it and stopped reading.
The chief ordered him to continue.
It was just worse.
I was a member of the city committee of SSM, and there I was gained as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who left the side, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and a wedding except in the national committee, I also had a church.
I disappointed the trust of the party in the worst way.
That's why I was excluded from her candidates.
But that's not enough!
I let both children be baptized, and even my mom, when she died, I fixed the church funeral, even though it was a former member of the party.
This shows my negative attitude to the leadership of the party.
When the caddler finished reading, only the knocking of the chief's pencil to the table interrupted the tense silence.
Everybody looked straight at me, and I wished I could be far away.
I kept saying, "Communist - overhuman, communist - overhuman." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the coppers?
I could've fixed the screwings without a fucking check.
But now?
She took her career of an irritating officer before she started.
Go back to the crew?
I don't think that's gonna work. I'm sure the chief's gonna leave me for an hour.
"Comrade, how did you check out the colleague here?" interrupted the tensioned silent chief with a question about the cluster.
Well, according to the previous job assessment.
Do you have him here?
Apparently, the cadravk wasn't over twice.
On the scratch of the sweating sweat, he was nervously dark as if he had been checked himself.
He was hoping to swim and put some paper to the chief.
"Well," said the chief with a sign of violentity, which, however, often had a prediction of the storm.
At first sight, praise, learned with commencement, studied an industrial workshop, worked in the task fees as a locker, filled the standard in the average of a hundred and twenty percent.
But it's a significant miss.
Where did you get that judgement, comrade?" he turned back to a cadricle who felt that it was starting to turn against it, and that he might not have to be a barrel very soon.
This is where a colleague gave it to me when he came in.
Is that enough for you?
"Well, when he came to us, he went to the district to the branch," he bleeded.
And there's no verification, the guy was somehow extra, so I put it in his file.
"So, when you were incorporated into the technical function, this cartridge of paper was enough for you," stated the chief.
The caddler was nervous, and he had no answer.
"No problem, we'll discuss it later," the chief closed the matter, and the cadricle was obviously relieved.
So far, it's steady.
"So what about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
It's all over, it's over!
I was dark in my eyes, and I was poured hot.
And I knew that I was the most disgusting creature in the world that didn't deserve the smallest mercy.
That by emphasizing the incomplete judgment, I made a mistake by a colleague of the cadrant referencer, and I didn't understand why the assessment was incomplete when I got it from the quadrator in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist living, which supports the rails of religious darkness during building real socialism, even participating in them.
That, that, there was a lot of things I did, or maybe I'm still doing and praying quietly to end it.
I don't care about it.
I didn't care if I flew out of the engineer's place.
I didn't care they'd take that potato too.
It's work for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in the eyes of the chief companion.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," the chairman of the party said suddenly, interrupting the chief's levits.
This is where a colleague made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he did the stupid thing!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget, Comrade Chief!
What can be worse for a young man than we close the door to his side for time!
In order to open again, he will have to prove that he has changed that he is worthy of our trust again.
The uneducated guard spoke as a book.
Where did it come from?
Is it so counted or papal phrase from party training and meetings?
That's why this young colleague must also get a chance from us!
It's a chance to prove that he's changed.
And who should give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young man, the truth, somewhat wrong companion, in his efforts to repair!
It's your party duty that no one can get you out!
In fact, it's a party duty to all of us.
This colleague must see that the side didn't forget him.
That as a loving mother, she does not only punish, but also loves.
When the president's finished, no one even wandered.
No one was expecting that situation.
At least me.
"I fully agree with you, Comrade President," the chief led the ice to try to reinitiate.
If you let me talk, you'd hear that's what I'd been thinking.
Everyone swimmed with their heads, but it was clear that he did not believe a word.
"So I was confirmed for the function of a separate referencer for the basic funds," I screamed when I returned to the office and cried.
Well, besides Eve's engineer, they were all at lunch.
Those silences listened to my unrelated treatment of fresh experiences, and in the meantime I calmed down.
When I finished, she asked if I could have coffee.
Without waiting for the answer, she built water on the cooking, and she was making cupcakes.
Meanwhile, she was talking about cadravical practices.
As one assessment, often full of praise, they give a man in their hand, and the other in which there is some dirt, they send to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was, but on the potato, so the colleagues from the factory didn't know where to send it.
And our cartridge?
He's just an old man where he'd eat or drink, so it's finally as it went.
"He's gonna catch it from the old," she noted viciously.
He sure won't like it today.
Keep an eye on him anyway, he's pretty revengeous.
And the party president?
In fact, much worse chief, no people.
Zero from a potato with great power.
The water for coffee began to swing, and the office filled the smell of just poured coffee.
I threw a cube of sugar in the cup and mixed the hot pig.
I hope I'm from the worst outside.
They won't fire me now, and the other checks are up to three years.
Anyway, my comrade chief won't forget that day.
It appears in the antology of LETERATES IN PAGE II in the EPIKA manufacturer
The alien symbol is resurrected.
The windscreen bike over Chlum again turns after years.
It is visible from a distance because it is located at 15 meters high.
People in the wide area call him "the wind on the Chlum."
For the municipality, 150 people became even one of the general signs that the community gained to the event of the 2010 tribute.
"We asked for a sign at that time, and the windmill, of course, wanted to have it, everyone knows it in the area," stated mayor Jiri Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical memory.
It is a little memorial of the present, since it reminds people of the time they fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was rare.
Until in 1910, noble representatives decided for solutions, which then suited up to the mid - 80 ’ s.
In the village near the branch office on Chichov, they left a seven meters deep well.
Three years later, the well was supplemented with a metal structure with a wind pump that was drawing water into the tank at the highest point of the municipality, near the church.
"The building was carried out by Antonín Kunc from the Borders on Morava with a load of 2.400 crowns," states the memorial sign on the ground-controlled construction of the coast.
After several repairs and wind circle falls, the cream was carried out in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter of the fight for water began to be written: that day the new water was served in Chlum.
The wind pump remained only a non-functional general symbol and this rarito.
The dominant was carried out during this year's family meeting.
Until in 2008, the Chlums decided to repair the wind wheel again and bring it back into the walk.
They let them make a replica of the original circle - a minimised by a mid-four-four-foot.
The bike was placed on the barn, but the same year it had to be brought down.
Because the manufacturer of the replica did not choose a suitable material, and the wheel was unable to resist the wind strikes.
Then the chlum dominant rested under the roof for several years.
However, since June this year, the bike on the high stake again turns.
At the occasion of a meeting, the community left a replica of the wheels to adjust and put it again on the top of the iron tower.
But the bike draws the water from the well only to the robbery of a blind shoulder.
And in the summer, we completely disconnected him because there was little water in the well.
At least it was in vain.
"On the autumn, then the wind wheel of the pump in the swallow basket again," explained Mayor Mashek.
Chlem is not the only village in the Czech Republic where the wind wheel came into the general sign, but is the only one of all of this species across the Altitude.
Similar elements in the mark have for the honor of local technical memories, for example, in Hvalkovic and Green Mountain in Wyskovsk, Kuželovo in Hodoninska, Partutovice in Rerovisk or in Police in Switzerland.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafata, she confessed Tripolis Goian.
"I remember the fight against Slavia very well, even my goal, as all in my career," 34-year-old Goian laughed at the pre-bank press conference.
That's when George Hagi trained us, it was bad we lost.
I hope I'll get a naked now, Sparta.
Only with the difference that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man who played 60 fights for Romanian representation is the key support of the Greek team.
As a tracker, he'll face the attacks of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come here, no hell, speaking of the Greek fight, Spartan Hybs.
And he partly knows what he can wait on Thursday night.
I know Fataie who played in Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all their fights.
I know he's a very good attacker, so he went to Sparta, said Goian.
He didn't name another football player of the Prague Club, so the direct question was if he knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech League and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled, and with a slightly sensitive view, he was targeting the Czech journalist.
The helpless expression in the face meant, "Why are you asking me?"
After a moment, he left quiet.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta played a lot of team.
He's got really good players.
What about Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don't know anyone else but Fataya.
Spartans know very well about Goian.
"He has experience from larger clubs, it can be said that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is such a game organizer," Spartian Assistant Stanislav Haykal noted.
Goian's got the best years behind, but he can be admired by a very interesting football biography.
At his time, Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester Cells of United and City, but went from Steauy to Italian Palerm, played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're waiting for an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays European cups, swims for the winning in the Czech Liga.
It's a favorite for me in this game, but we're playing at home and we want the group to start with a good result.
Just like Sparta, we'll try to win, Goian said.
I'm in a room with a Slovak brancer Tomasz Kosic, who is very excited at the Czech rival.
Me too.
But for the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Koffola moves from Poland to Czech Republic, considering the entry to the Prague Bureau.
The new seat should have Kofol in Ostrava.
The S.A. Koffola was registered in Poland for trade in stocks of the company at the Warsaw Bureau.
Our primary goal is to have a group's seat in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have currently taken within the project are mainly legal and administrative and have no real impact on the situation in society, says Daniel Burysh, the financial director of the Kofola Group.
"In connection with the movement of the group, the shareholders consider the location of the stocks at the Prague Bureau."
In order to enter the Burza of Pricing Papers Prague, the company completes the prospectus of a valuable paper that will submit the Czech National Bank to approval as soon as possible.
The movement of holdings and related share transfers will be carried out in a form of public transaction with only existing shareholders.
Therefore, no shares will be offered in this operation to register the public or new investors.
"The random offer of shares to new investors would be made - if so society and its shareholders decide - later, either on 4th quarter of 2015 or on 1 quarter 2016," the company said.
The company has already stated in the past that a possible offer of shares could consist of the emission of new shares or sales of existing stocks.
This offer could be composed of an offer of stocks in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the location of stocks even at the Warsaw Bureau.
The Czech Television Objectivity Test for information on the migrant crisis.
Another small test of objectivity and balance reporting of the main Czech media on the refugee crisis.
This time, the main reporting session of Czech Television.
How did she endure?
Once journalist college teaches how the media can manipulate reality, they can release today's Czech TV event.
The migrant crisis was dedicated to about 80% of the reporting.
Until the first minute when the CT informed the disturbances on the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks of migrants against policemen, she called them eufemistically to be patient - they threw stones and attacked metal sticks), the current promigrant propaganda has already taken place - judge the names of individual reports.
Criticism of non-governmental organisations - a large area for non-profit organisations that criticize bad treatment of migrants.
Syrian children in Czech School - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
The fugitives are not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
The journey of refugees - CT consistently uses the expressions of runner or escaper, not migrant.
It's mostly impressive that the PT uses only and only recordings for small children and women in illustrative images.
In the same broadcast, she stated that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic were men.
Summary: Most of the propaganda that has no periods of communist agitations.
I have to say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I used to get into a panel apartment, I soon stopped being the only inhabitant.
My fisheries moved to the toilet.
Fishing home, insect with imperfect transformation, i.e. that does not produce the regeneration from the pumpkin and the youth looks like an adult individual, but is only small and gradually growing.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't lay them down.
First manually and later chemically.
Socialist drugs on their liquidation provided some blue crystals.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
However, they were successfully eliminated.
I've dealt with Pharaohs later, like that.
A box with some juvenalizer that the ants brought into their nest and then he did not allow the queen to generate a new offspring.
But I turned it off.
As time went, the insect became the subject of my admiration, and I was increasingly committed to the view that they had the same right to life as we humans.
Furthermore, I have experienced that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one can replace another.
I don't think I'd repeat the truth with the bleaches and puppies to make my karma worse by killing them.
In a new residence, my partner and I agreed that if the fishes don't climb behind our neck, let them eat in peace the waste skin, some of those invisible altars, and so on.
Their peaceful existence after time broke the spider.
It was an ordinary kind of a coat that had been sitting on the ceiling for a long time.
We felt that he lived from occasional mushrooms and mosquitoes, which just raised our comfort.
Because he's been with us for a few years, we found that he's been eating mainly fish and that his number was obviously maintained in the abduction.
Confidential regular contact at every required time we found it a female.
Because we were witnesses of romantic insults with a partner about a third of the smaller, how carefully he wiped on the spider fibres so that he wouldn’t be eaten before he could reach an eager copulation.
It took about three days when they did not move and respond to our controls.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love players were playing, we later found the rest of the dried male.
Then the spider didn't even move for a long week.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging a variety in her neighborhood.
They're gone soon.
They were partly eaten by mommy, and they had a piece of frustration to another place.
Even a female disappeared after a week.
If she left or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, she appeared on the ceiling again.
Truth, something smaller, probably the daughter of that toilet householder.
For a while from the ceiling, she carefully observed our behaviour and, moving under the toilet mice, evaluated our failure as friendship.
The number of multiplied fisheries were reduced again, and the spider was calmly looking at its usual activities to ensure food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed all year.
Our daughter has grown up to the age of the use of the nightmare was shameful.
We've tolerated it so far, but the eternal pouring of his content has already been in our minds.
We encouraged her to use the bathroom.
However, the daughter found an excuse in the spider that she saw very well when she was rubbed.
Our talks about seeing a spider, the luck in the house didn't even take.
I'm crying and screaming her nightmare.
It wasn't the rest.
There was a moment when a spider had to be commissioned in the interest of the daughter's development movement.
It's on me.
He was grabbed into the glass and exposed through the balcony somewhere in the garden.
I was divorced with him as a friend, but after such a long time, I felt ugly as if I was throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the fishes would begin to appear more frequently and multiply in a geometric order.
It's a wonder, week, two, none of us showed up there.
I started speculating about the cause.
I was wondering if the spider had somehow raised them by the pattern of ants, that the toilet environment was not as favourable for their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were reindeering again.
I had to figure out another theory about the cause of their disappearance and I figured that their spider bond must have had the reason that when they don't see him, he was hiding in some other place and that they were threatened anywhere.
Or maybe they had some telepathic connection with their predator and his rapid disappearance caused some reaction.
I'm not making any illusions about their eyes.
Some light shyness showed, but that they would react to waving hands or quick movements, it was not.
The daughter's going to the bathroom regularly.
I think she forgot about the nighttime.
It's just to attract a spider again.
I'm already sending my wishes into the eter, and I hope they didn't close on me after that execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use the Cyclone B.
The ten words of Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
Apparently, the words of a brilliant scientist of the past century will never stop fascinating mankind.
He was able to dive into everything so deep that the fertility was always an amazing finding.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all ages.
In the awareness of humans, he first entered his special and general theory of relativity, which has so far best described the universe in its giant relationship.
It is also impossible to mention its explanation of the photo effect or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the self-description and system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so complicated for many that for closer acquaintance they prefer to choose easy relations.
But it is not easy.
Of course, it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if it hadn't even found a brilliantly simplified form of explanation: The watch close to your loved one seems to be a minute; the minute in the hot baking seems to be an hour - and that's relativeity.
I've been allowed from his whole playage of famous citates to choose these ten who literally caught me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, genius try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Universe and human nonsense.
I'm not so sure about that first one.
No number of attempts can never prove I was right.
But the only one can ever prove that I was wrong.
But it's a sad period when it's easier to break atoms than to destroy prejudices.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of a mess in mind, what then reflects the empty table?
I don't know what he's going to fight in the third world war, but in that quarter, it'll be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but no way to resurrect him.
Knowing a little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with the problem that would depend on my life, I would spend 40 minutes on his study, 15 minutes with his analysis and 5 minutes of its solution.
It's the hardest thing in the world to understand taxes from income.
Finally, I cannot forgive Einstein's formula on the definition of success: Take-li A for success, the sample is valid: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to hold the tongue.
New and modern.
Hospitals in Zlinsk County are waiting for changes in $1.5 billion.
"It is a success, considering that all four are kept in black numbers all this year," said heithman Stanislav Mišák satisfiedly.
The total profit of district facilities is about 32 million crowns at this time.
The share of this is mainly higher than insurance, which is equally favourable for this year.
Even this fact shows that after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In the Cmerrise, the Holy Sweet, the Uher District, and Zlina, they are declined to buildings that will cost nearly 1,5 billion crowns together.
The long time we've been shopping mostly of the devices, it's over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, high health can't be done, he justified the plans of the district deputy of Lubomir Netime.
They're looking forward to changes in all hospitals.
Builders are coming to hospitals next year.
In the temple, they are now choosing suppliers of a new internal pavilon for nearly 300 million crowns.
They have a planned dialysis port in the Creamers.
The Uherian Building wants to accommodate a new intern for approximately 200 million for this year.
And a long-term construction of a new central income and an intern that takes three quarters of billion.
In all cases, it is essential and often the biggest changes in the past years.
"For the whole region, patients and doctors, this is an extremely important step," said for example, the Little Internal Director of the Hospital Vera Prouscová.
Five-Path building there should be completed in approximately two years and offers comfortable equipment for internal and neurology, dialysis, new ambulance, bed and intensive care units.
More comfort for patients.
Changes that are significantly recognized by patients will affect all regions.
The new buildings are replaced by those who, for example, lie in a single room, need only one toilet on the floor, beds are unearthable, windows are neighbouring, and health careers do not have appropriate conditions for work.
"For example, our intern has been built fivety-fifty years ago and is now on the border of its life," stated the chief of the Zlyn Hospital, Paul Calabek.
In a few years, it will be replaced by a seven - floor modern building connected with an emergency income.
The doctors and patients will have all acute departments in one place, in addition in new spaces.
The same model has already got half the Uher District.
The central income is already standing and the interior will be at it within three years.
"We will pay the building from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained director Peter Sladek.
This hospital is the one in the area who can afford its own funding.
The profit is still the highest and it has not been lost two years ago when the Zlyn hospital may have struggled with almost two hundred million losses.
"We have good insurance contracts, excellent performance, we increase revenues and we effectively manage expenses throughout the hospital," Vlastimil Vajdak said, who is responsible for the economy.
Improvements will also be expected by patients of exclusive hospitals.
For ten to 15 years, he will be able to repair, new devices and reconstructions to half a billion crowns.
This year will be a complete repair of the capture station, then a dialysis port starts, if possible, building a building for a new magnetic resonance.

No one explained how I should keep accepted refugees in the country when they don't want to live in Czech Republic.
The Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec (CSSD) complains after negotiations with its European colleagues that the other states of Czech Republic are pushing the quotas for the re-separation of refugees, but they refuse any discussion.
It also suggests that no one has yet explained how to keep allocated refugees in Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We have not received the answer, and therefore we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text," the Lovec said to the journalists.
Can you more specifically describe the position you have come to at the interior and foreign ministers of the European Union?
We disagree with obligatory quotas like a system that just can't work.
We can't talk about migrants as salts or flour bags.
They're living creatures who have visions, somewhere they're heading, some relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we were able to maintain migrants in the territory of the Member States if they were distributed.
We can't imagine it.
We did not get the answer, so we wanted the quotas to be released from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration sites, border protection, camps outside Europe, the Lieutenant Fund for African countries and other matters, we have no problem with this.
We've been talking about it for a year, and we're saying this is the way.
But say the quotas will solve everything?
We've been dealing with 40 grand recently, now it's 10,000.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in the territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross us want to go to Germany.
We don't know how to keep them here.
Our ambition is to have other foreigners, Ukraine, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a target country, but the interest of people from this migration wave, that is from Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mention that the fugitives didn't even want to see us, but 1500 people have already committed to accepting.
Wouldn't it be possible to take them this way more?
We have committed to accepting 1500 people, but with the condition.
We said, functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even in those 1500, there's 1100 people to deal with the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facilities and we'll treat them as we've caught.
It is a big question, and we will discuss this with Europe if we can detain people registered in Italy and Greece, if possible in Hungary.
Because Europe treats it so that if they have registration, they cannot be detained.
That means, they will come to our territory with registration, and if the agreement is not yet, it may happen that we will not hold those 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will return to Germany after they arrived.
If we can keep them during asylum proceedings, we will arrange asylum procedure with them.
If the Citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 per cent of the European statistics acquire international protection.
Then they get documents that will allow them to travel across Europe.
And I think these people will end again in target countries.
Then there are four hundred people here to move.
This is the second project that is currently under way, and there we have only progressed in debating with the churches about the possibility that they can help them acquire employment, accommodation and so on.
But it's a run on a very long track.
You said that the ministers were not willing to discuss with us.
But isn't it that the Czech Republic just rejects quotas, but does not offer any solidary step that would unlock the discussion?
And what exactly is this a solid step you think?
If the Federal Republic of Germany exhorts that all migrants from Syria can benefit from them, the report is spreading in order of hours after all camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another migration wave that's heading to Germany because they just don't want to come to us.
We think that the road is the protection of external borders -- just the migration waves to discontinue, help the needy, and separate economic migrants.
Clearly show them that they don't have a chance.
Only last year, 50 thousand Kosovons arrived in Germany.
From safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including police, courts, state representation.
If we were able to separate them and not accept them or accept them only on the basis of the needs of the economy, 50 percent of what social systems issued today could go to refugees.
In contrast to the first day when Germany conducted controls, the number of detainees in Czech have jumped.
Now it's 80, the first day was twelve.
Where is it supposed to go to to make the border checks stronger?
We were afraid of hundreds of people in order.
These are the numbers we're dealing with.
We still have a few hundred free places in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we're detaining will be returned to Austria in seven days.
We're doing it standardly.
The surveys are the only ones who take these people to us, with Hungary, it's complicated, and the Greeks -- that's a totally useless story.
So where's the breakpoint?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it's gonna take a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day two, three days after each other are exhausting our capacity so much that the crisis plans will come up.
Then I am agreed with Mr. Prime Minister to immediately call for an extraordinary government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
If this situation occurred, the government may take place on de facto immediately and by a resolution, decide to strengthen the military police, let's give it the customs office, if possible, on the prison service.
The continental variance is the exceptional condition that Hungary has now declared in certain places?
I don't think this can happen so far.
Recognize that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, the Schengen border only and only at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen to this happen in the territory of the Czech Republic, and I don't want to disseminate alarms.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to dismiss the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct path to Austria.
The Czech Republic would have touched it very borderly, almost at all.
Slavia paid a lot of debts for the last moment.
They're trying to prevent the decline.
Football Slavia paid debts.
The football players were waiting for their money.
Football Slavia was standing on Tuesday for the first time due to insolvency proceedings in court.
Almost three months after about 20 million crowns supplied an online service company from Pacific Samoa.
Lawyer Slavia Zuzana Mladková tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzl in a few hours that the Slavia should not announce a decline.
And you have to say, she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week the new owner of Slavia became a large Chinese industrial and investment group of CEFC, as well as the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimana.
Apparently, from new owners to the club money has arrived in the last minute.
This is also evidenced by the statement of Slavia before the Tuesday trial - the top club on Monday, just a day before the trial, sent tens of millions of crowns.
"Everything has been awarded between September 11 and September 15," stated the lawmakers Slavia Mladik.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
For example, the Slovak Expresentant of Milan Ivan or the Czech defender, Maria Ličkov.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexandr Losenicki.
On Friday, the club also paid debts to the city part of Prague 10.
The part of the insolvency dispute remains de facto only the claims that Slavia disturbs.
Or, according to the club, the commitments have not been made, or the court disputes are being led.
However, we are ready to pay the amounts for the loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds on the bank account, which we can testify with the account," told the Judge, attorney Mladko.
"All that has been paid has been awarded," said Mladková and added that they are not only inappropriate or distorted obligations.
It is also that the judge will not decide in the coming days and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she really paid those debts.
Then there will be an assessment of all the evidence.
The decision can therefore be expected first in November.
The judge ordered the proceedings to continue on 3 November.
However, the decision does not take place at this meeting, but in writing after it.

Blanka was going to build so she wouldn't fall.
But it would cost about half a billion more, says a company expert designing a tunnel.
Blanca was going to hit even safer, says the expert.
The tunnel complex of Blanka was able to build so that two ruins of the land in Prague Tree, Satra producer director, who is the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovic.
He said it on Wednesday night at a journalist's tunnel search.
But he thinks it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
The drivers are opening on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel was going to strike safer, costs but grow exponentially," said Butovic.
The conditions in the Tree were all the time the same, but the country fell only a few steps away from the place from where he began to run a safer and cautious method.
"If the measures were used 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion more expensive," said Butovic.
Blanka's tunnel crashed three times during the building.
Twice, in 2008, a croter was created in Dromovca, and in 2010 the soil fell down at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to the director of Metrostav, Jiri Belohlava, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, said Euro week.
The building was based on the original intention of 17 billion crowns.
If we figure out the VAT that's doubled during the construction, you have 11 of 17 billion.
When technologies, land purchases and engineering activities, valoration and similar items are added, it is 29 billion, which is not from 37 to this distance, he said, Belohlav.
Someone ordered it and paid it.

FedExu profits mixed, fiscal view reduction for 2016
The company FedEx announced unsatisfactory results during the last quarter and a huge reduction in the forecast of the annual profit due to a low demand for cargo transport and higher costs for the land division.
The company also stated that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During the last year's period, the FedEx announced that he would rent for the holidays of 50,000 seasonal workers.
Company shares decreased by approximately 2,5 per cent in pre-trade 45 minutes before the median opening.
The company FedEx states that he expects a salary between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year, which ends next May, which means a drop of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analytics expected $10.84, according to a study carried out by FactSet.
The lower view comes despite the average increase in interest rates by 4,9 per cent, which will be shown in January. 4, and higher supplements for land transport of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company stated that it still expects growth in profits compared to the previous year due to reducing costs, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
The chairman of the Bureau and the Director-General of the company Fred Smith said that the company was "producing firm performance despite weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in the processing industry and global trade."
The holiday rental plans were announced on the day after the rival UPS said that the plan was to hire 90 000 to 95 000 additional employees, which is probably as they hired last year.
In August 31, the company FedEx won $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The profit for the share was $2.42, which is less than $2.44 for the stock, which was foreseen by 12 analytics questioned by Zacks Investment Research.
The markets increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts asked by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, the company FedEx has been affected by a decline in the priority of international shipping transport, which has resulted in stagnating revenues in its Express Unit.
But the boom in online shopping strengthened the results of the FedEx land unit.
In the last quarter, land income increased by 29 per cent, but the operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The Express Unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while the profit decreased in the commodity trade due to higher labour prices.
In pre-trading about an hour before the opening of the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or by 2.5 per cent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with 11 per cent a year and 17 per cent under the 11th June record.
At their most expectable meeting for the years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week sitting at 27 feet of the long Hondurasian mahagon table and will decide whether it is time to increase the key interest rate after almost ten years.
With regard to them at one end of the ornament of the Central Bank, the two- floor session room will be a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that President Fed Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should give economic interests to the nation above all other.
The Central Bank has a double charge from the Congress: maximize US employment and maintain stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the representatives of the Feder have recognized that there is an unwritten third functional period: financial stability.
And this third functioning period could be an X-factor in too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to start in the departure of the unprecedented stimulation in the form of almost zero short-term interest rates at the site since the end of 2008.
Although most data show a solid growth in the economy, recent turbulences on world financial markets could already scare the Fed carefully to add to continuity by increasing its reference rate of federal funds - even nothing more than just a quarter of the percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labour and inflation market will be the most important thing to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, the main economist of the trade company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for a reason for no increase in the level, the increased insecurity of the surrounding global market already gives them sufficient reasons to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what Fed does, which is the cause of nervousness on the financial markets itself.
Approximately half of the economies recently asked by Blomberg had predicted an increase in the rate this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to delay, with a key indicator only about 30% chances to increase.
This would indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed would increase rates only if the politicians made a ruin by promised that the further increase would be in no way.
Industrial average Dow Jones jumped by 228,89 points on Tuesday, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The meeting was launched by expecting the Fed policy to delay rates this week in peace, says John Lonski, the main economy in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed now raised rates," he said.
If the Fed politicians did it, "they'd have to go to extremes in their programming statements and hold financial markets behind their hands so that the panic could not fall."
Other experts claimed that the increase of rates would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty of how the Fed will proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 per cent of this month, the first small step in slowly improving the currency conditions that would confirm the power of economic recovery in the United States.
Yellen said that during the spring and early summer, she expects an increase in rates this year despite the complaints from the Liberals that it needs more economic progress.
Although the creation of jobs in August slowed down, the labour market recorded solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, which is lowest in more than seven years and is close to the level Fed considers full employment.
Remuneration benefits showed the signs of lifting.
And even though the inflation continues under 2% of the target of the Central Bank, the Fed politicians claim that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "is able to deal with higher rates and needs them, given the closeness of the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, the main economy of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world began to be distorted at the end of the last month after China devalued its currency.
Industrial average of Dow Jones dropped up to 16% under its record value in May, when investors were afraid that the slow Chinese economy would bring down global growth.
The market has somewhat reflected this month and Dow is only losing nearly 10% of May's maxim.
The Fed's political factors have a discontinuous situation on the market delivers a complex calculation when calculating the increase in interest rate.
"In the absence of what happened on the financial markets, and reports of the weaknesses of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would be an intensity at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, chief researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official of the Fed.
He now predicts that they will wait for at least a month to get better control of the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact that it will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on about the latest development in China," Oliner said.
The health status of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so technically it should not be included in their decisions.
But in fact, the Fed became the currency of the world.
The Central Bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
Only the indication of the former President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that Fed could "use" their monetary expansion on the market has been launched throughout the world.
In the world where markets and economies are still connected, it can be expected that the representatives of the Feder are watching development elsewhere, but also advise other central bankers and experts to read better the state of the global economy.
Their decision process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for Envestnet Inc wealth management.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., noted this month that "Fed has a history of excessive movements on financial markets that seem unrelated to economic funds."
Lacker, a voting member of the policymaking of the Federal Open Market Committee, quoted the decision in 1998-99 as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its reference rate by 0.75 per cent during the three sessions "Although limited identification impacts on growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the representatives of the Feder have turned these shorts.
The Fed should prefer the concerns of financial stability only during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., former member of the Committee established in the Bank of England.
The latest shouting is not even getting closer to this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in the situation of fear of growth rates, because the markets are upset," Posen, President of the Institute for International Economics, said.
The Federal Reserve System Act has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should get on the top.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in the Chinese quarter.
Yes, Chinese neighborhood
The market/sklad was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
Frequently referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a large-trade Thai market that is also selling for the public.
Yes, it's a Chinese neighborhood, not Thai.

If you are hungry from all this shopping, go to LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trade station (good, cheap) is close to registers and has various seals.

Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lots that share with other stores and restaurants.
While the store can be busy, parking is usually not difficult to find.
The speed on the road will stay on the old.
Acceleration by 150 km/h has been rejected.
In the selected road segments, the highest allowed speed of 150 km/h will not be possible to increase under the favourable conditions.
At Tuesday, the House decided, when it joined the amendment proposal to the Senate, which he refused to increase speed.
The new law on land communications is now heading towards the president.
President Miloš Zeman said at the end of April that the law that would allow a steady-five-millimeter vet.
The Minister of Transport, Dan CZK, according to the Czech road network, has not yet been built at such speed.
Chuck supported the senate version of the law on Tuesday before the Member.
The approved novel will now allow, in accordance with the original government proposal, to increase speed from 90 to 110 km per hour on the first-class selected roads, in particular four-roads.
The House first extended this option to the highways where it could be driven in selected speeds to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
The messengers have now joined his proposal.
Senators also expelled the authorization of the Transport Police to make the last word in the adjustment of local communications to the community.
The Senate Version, approved by the House, also counts that the sewering, waterwaters or public lighting cables can be stored along the surface of the vehicles.
The municipalities would save that for the buying of lands.
The municipality should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along the local roads regardless of the owner of the property concerned.
Novela is also to help improve road protection and facilitate the loading of distracted vehicles to which the owners are not reporting.
The new ventures may sell distracted vehicles which will not be reported within the six-month period following the notice of the withdrawal of their owners.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit cargo transport across their territory after the roads of the second and third classes under the threat of the penalty and for spare companies.
It is also discontinued by the possibility of introducing electronic roadmarks instead of original papers, which will be used even after 1 January of the next year.
According to the government, it will save money for the establishment of an electronic system.
The restraint exhibitor is going to court.
He's been threatened for his predicted welcome to the citizens for 10 years.
The case applies to the allegedly predicted Municipal Greeting Project.
The police wanted to pursue the case as well as the Member of Zuzana Kail (CSSD), but the Ambassador did not issue it.
According to the legal qualification of the case, both of them are in danger for ten years of imprisonment.
The main calculation is scheduled for two October days.
According to the State Representative, Mandik and Macik have caused damage to at least one million crowns, resulting from the prosecution.
The prosecutor is based on an expert opinion.
The former members of the city's leadership according to the prosecutor's title have inadequately allowed their functions to obtain the property benefit of the company which organised the welcomes of the citizens.
The Mandik, according to the accusation of the Chief of the Urban, Education and Cultural Division, has set up to address five connected companies in the selection management.
When another company who offered the lowest price joined the competition, the board of competition cancelled.
The city was then to be conferred to the Administrator and only the Darothore, which was then awarded by the City Council.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both charges aimed to ensure that Darothore awarded a public contract for the conduct of a long-term welcome of the citizens in Usto over Labe and coordinatedly acted at least in contrast with the requirement of the procedure with the care of the proper economist, state representative wrote.
At the same time, he said they were aware that the company Darothore will subsequently, after obtaining this contract, calculate the Ust above the Labe for the implementation of the event Congratulations to the citizens of the price, which will be incompatible with the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company incased more than five million crowns for the project.
The city eventually paid only one part, approximately 1.7 million crowns, then departed from the contract.
The amount paid was, according to the expert assessment, at least by a million crowns.
The Mandik has already refused any violations of the law.
No criminal act, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this constructed cause, the former primator said before, that the city under his leadership was just connecting to a similar project from the past years.
In 2008-2010, the event was guaranteed by the agency Roxy II.
"It was under the same conditions, under the same money," Mandik added.
Criminalists also wanted to accuse Caille, who was also a member of the City Council.
But the House of Ambassador didn't put her to the prosecution.
Therefore, criminals postponed the cause in her case, but they count on Kail's accusation after the messenger's mandate ends.
The welcome of the citizens was a social action that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift check for 5,000 crowns for the purchase of children’s needs and small gifts.
Hungarian cops allegedly let the dog's refugee.
Then they forced the journalists to delete the record.
The Hungarian police said that at the border with Serbia, a cameraman of the AP was shortly detained and forced him to delete the record on which the police dog reportedly hit the country of the refugee.
But the Hungarian government questions this charge.
The alleged incident occurred on Saturday night when a cameraman AP Luca Muzi filmed migrants who across the corn field near the Hungarian city of Röszke crossed the border with Serbia.
A policeman went against the fugitives, and one of them left a certain Syrian to attack a dog with a basketball on a hook.
The dog of the man who screamed "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," he screwed up, said Muse.
That Muzi was filming everything, he noticed one of the cops and didn't let him leave.
Then the journalist was not allowed to call his superior or his colleagues.
The Muzi cops took him to a dark place at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he was recorded.
Then they ordered him to delete the record.
This is how the museum lost the result of two-day work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to the speaker of the Hungarian government, Zoltan Kovacs.
The conduct of the police in it was unacceptable and stated that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not to be afraid that the government would destroy the legally acquired material.
Kovacs with the appeal to the police report of the Muzi's treatment of events argued.
He said the cops just wanted a journalist to show them if they were on some recordings, which they said they had the right to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force him to wipe.
"The dogs can knock - they're trained to frighten and push a little fear, but they surely didn't attack," said Kovacs.
Unpredictable League of Masters.
Victory on City will hit us, believe Juventus
"It's disappointment, I don't think we deserve to lose," he crushed his head by Manuel Pellegrini, the coach of the hometown.
We had more chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic game of the League of Masters.
No team has created a lot of opportunities, but the ball on the balls has been longer than us.
"The cause of defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just shot two beautiful goals," he estimated the fighting of Pellegrini, whose team incassed in the competitive struggle for 636 minutes.
That finalist of the past Juventus season was on it before the mutual encountering exactly the opposite - after the first three rounds of the Italian league has the title defender only a point and the score of 2:4 is located up to the 16th place of the table.
And that's why the turning to the Etihad Stadium was a great surprise.
"This victory will help us mentally, it will hit us," believes Coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three resistance - Pirla, Téveze and Vidal before the new year.
In Manchester, Pogba, Manjukich and Morata were represented.
"It's true, this victory is very important, and it may help us get into a winning wave," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best men in Europe.
In the second half time, we were better, especially in the attack phase.
This is what my players deserve.
"We could have incassed to 0:2, but Gianluigi has held us before our comparison goal," the Allegri Golfman Buffon coach commended.
"We burned a few good chances," was hated by Yaya Tourego, the city's booker.
We have to marry the League of Experience Masters and try to get better results next time.
Goodbye Angela, old Germany II.
Before we continue with the question of immigrants, we should realize that all the media scratching around is managed by professionals.
According to the media needs, as well as to the top.
So let's just stop for a second.
Today there are newspapers and media full of children who carry their parents on their hands after the dust exode paths.
And it causes a person -- that is, in a European person -- automatic guilt and sympathy.
Well, they're not just coming here desperate kids, notice on the landing boats to the Greek islands that the kids aren't seeing them so much!
Well, somehow, we've recently disappeared from the television of the pictures of ships heading to Lampedus, the fugitives from the French border at Menton, whose beautiful promenade are thousands of young men.
Many of the young black men.
And also the pictures of Callais disappeared, where these are eating, and black men are waiting for them to go through a tunnel under La Manche.
He probably doesn't get it anymore.
Even those pictures of the primitive Christian Church of Eritrea did not have a special impression on the people of Europe.
Too much of it was fake.
So when it comes to the quotas for escapers, it's kind of secret that it's not just the unhappy children in Syria, but also the standing - for the elders: fashioned - young men.
Their muscles look like they just got out of some fit center.
It's just one personal experience.
This summer on Turkish - Muslim - parts of Cyprus, we lied on the private beach of the hotel.
Despite the fact that it was private, a large group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
But no chunks.
And the young black men came out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30.
They walked into the beach, all the clothes in the tags and shoes, in their hands, otherwise, smartphones.
That it was a private beach, and the employees - Turks, Muslims! - obviously feared them.
They've taken all the beds.
Whoever didn't lie on it and was just in the sea, was unfortunate.
They were dressed like an American rapper movie.
On the heads of the hat with a nail, white and colored adidas on your feet.
Then they surrounded the local beach bar and started raising.
They borrowed tables around, stuck up next to the sitting eating and white guests of the bar - read to the Muslims and the Europeans without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace somewhere calm.
The incoming niggers were drinking a beer right from thirds - how in the US series?! - on the beach they threw empty bottles around them.
They kept screaming loudly on each other.
It wasn't English, of course.
Then they went into wine drinks, also from the bottle.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in labels, especially those young ladies -, in the water they screamed and screamed, mothers with children and pensioners scarely fled and in half an hour he was no longer on the beach or in the pool.
Everyone's gone.
No matter whether one was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel employees were just worried about them.
The waiter said, "Have you seen the gold they were wearing?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, they definitely didn't have it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had a massive gold chain around their necks.
And one of them had about 20 centimeters of gold cross on his neck.
And women were like gold.
"That's drug smugglers?" I asked.
"Well, you saw them drink," the waiter answered.
The drugs aren't saving, they don't use.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I've already realized what they've been smuggling.
Of course, it wasn't that important to me in June 2105.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
But secret services and top politicians were supposed to know it first.
I don't think they know.
At that time, about 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe.
And they go and go and go.
Today, the main problem of the European Union is that totally policy-correct politics, as if intellectual and economically important groups were attached to them, have the greatest strength in Europe.
Germany and its politicians -- now publicly recognised main forces in Europe -- lie, lie and lie -- but not only they, including the EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television pictures on the excited welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of Moscow TV images of August 1968.
Of course, there were a few sunshinemen at the station, but mostly, the Muslims welcomed their cousins.
Long weeks have been chattering in reports on Czech TV, as some research suggests that the Germans are almost all for the arrival of immigrants.
Of course, who was only a few days in Germany knows that it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms further information.
For example, a famous public opinion research organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Societys of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of the Germans wanted to accept even more refugees.
That's what our television also reported.
Of course, it has been secret to what the next day broke out in Germany: 94.5% of the Germans no longer want immigrants - the polls attended 67,000 people.
It is true that Officer Merkel publicly announced in November 2010, which is, five years ago, "Our efforts for `multi-culti' have totally failed."
And then she said, "Germany gives up the fight for multicultural society."
"All attempts for such a combination have totally failed."
In a country where four million Muslims live, it does not believe that a strategy that allowed people from the different cultural environment to live by themselves without being integrated. Today they live with us, and we lied to each other for a while that they would not stay, and that one day they would disappear again.
But it's not reality.
Multicultural approach when we think we're just living happy with each other, this approach failed.
He totally failed.
But neither does Merkel have the power to go against powerful Germany and Europe, and mostly against political correction.
It shows the escalation of events.
Conflict is rapidly rising.
The Euro-German Schulz, President of the European Parliament, is the only member of the SPD, who is allegedly not even a graduate in the European parliament - yes, that's the one about which Berlusconi in the EU Parliament said that he could play a concentrate supervisor since a minute - as he has shown himself more times.
It appears, especially under the impression of the recent German politics' statements that Germany exceeded Rubikon.
Notice that, in addition to some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the nationals of the nazis who are victims are frightened.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
What years have they tried, at least outside, to deal with their horrible past of aggressor and a million killer?
Are those who say that in the soul of Germany, the devil's aggression, superiority, and violence?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped the attempts of the Velkoman to control the whole Europe?
When did he say that the genero-German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he had.
When he was dismissed, preparation for World War One began.
The thought of the UK, which led Germany and Europe to two wars of millions of lives, probably returned in another form.
After attempting to control the state, for example, with Rote Armee Fraction, and after the failure of the NDR, the ecology, which, by the way, was one of the main ideas of Nazism, began to develop a new German ideology.
We'd say sunshine.
The German elites have long defended the formation of German nationalism, so they have left all those fighters against the atom, the enthusiasms looking for a paradise for all, silently supported the old emperor's and Nazi password Our forest must live.
To satisfy the uncomfortable young people who all over the world want to do something different and better, fully on the side of the warriors against the warming of the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there is also a strong anti-semit - so-called propalestinian - and the anti-Slovak stream that all the Slovenians considers a difficult recruit - since Karl Marx, who, after parents, was primarily a German nationalist.
Also, as the latest statements of Schulze and German ministers show openly threatening unsubordinated Eastern States, the idea of leader Germany.
Which must be listened without reply.
Otherwise, it's bad for you!
And if we interfere with that that immigrants are a very influenced group of voters, we have what we have.
And it stands behind it as always as capital, especially German, which is satisfied and which is the fact that Germany actually controls most of Europe's countries through banks and the Union.
The alias of suncaters first brought Germany into the balls of ecologicalism and multiculturalism and brought them home today and perhaps brings millions of Muslims.
Which, the tasteful voices of sirens, will hit the wall of reality that Merkell doesn't want to see, and they start to wander.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors again by force, again part of its people - but it seems still a smaller part - to slide ideologically, but eventually reality will achieve it as always.
Is Germany gonna burn again?
Muslim holidays are already on fire.
What will the German government do when the Germans protest against the arrivals of Islamic?
Will the Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time come to help, but certainly not assimilated to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when the naturalized Muslims, the incoming Islamists and the Germans, who are watching the fear of islamising their country?
What will it do to the Germans, and even to Germany, when people rise loudly and publicly protest against the new Euroman Muslim?
Germany just changed.
The conflict, which has caused in Europe support of the solar ideology, i.e. the ideology of the elite and in principle the totality and its insecurity banks, is growing.
And because of the unfailing negotiation against the inherent democratic Germans and all the underlying and inherent eastern neighbours, it can't go well.
Tomorrow's finished.
The best way to get rid of the incoming sellers is to scare them to death.
Just knock, and the robust knocking on you is a way that weaker nature doesn't just have to stop.
The living head will eradicate you well and torn and poisoned, accompanied by an unexpensive salesman and a live statue.
Maybe it's a shame that the speaking knocking can't even be acquired.
We'd also use a lot of bullshit and dicks to chase.
Pink (Oxalis corniculata).
A small corn that tolerates the dry environment.
So it's between the outdoor tiles near my place.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to expansive grass, but appears to have a nice impression on flowers.
It's located between the outdoor tiles.
She's inexperienceable, she's good at our garden.
She likes a dryer environment, she's easy to adapt, modest and unavoidable.
It creates sheets with chaotic composition, but it is worth watching it and taking pictures on.
Under the minority, the beauty of detail is only found - yellow flowers and green leaves with purple escort.
Brazilian pediatric company Rio Grande promotes healthy diet during breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric company SPRS came with a shocking way to try to mediate women knowledge of the importance of good food in breast-feeding using pictures of children sucking from the breast painting of ill-food.
Human maternal milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide infants with all the foods needed to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to the reconciliation of energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are recommended to increase the daily calories income by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calories income is not the only diet measures that mothers should follow.
Recent studies carried out by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetic creation of their children and protected them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, it was also confirmed that unhealthy diets had a negative impact on the child's immunity system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the rates, even though Nine's trying to take the lead in Today's Show
With Karl Stefanovice and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover costs for the consequences of the escape of liberal leadership, it was unable to create sufficient increases in the estimates for Today.
The morning show Nine projected from the national capital after Malcolm Turnbull was thrown by Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise and host David Koch and Samantha Armytage were stuck in London as part of a long series of international television broadcasting, which also includes Dubai, New York, the Nigerian waterfalls and Cancun.
It didn't seem to be so important in this tiranium to the Aussie TV, because it recorded in the average of 397.000 viewers in five main cities compared to 330.000 broadcasts Today.
Today it recorded a smaller increase in its assessment compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but their number was until last Thursday (343 000).
Today, in the last months, he fills a space on Sunrise.
In August, the average of 318 000 in Today compared to 330 000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the space was moving between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has a average of 349 000 viewers and Today 314 000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds affect more than Parliament this morning, friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Added TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news for Seven was an impressive debut of 800 words with the former star Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
The new drama of a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children into the direct part of New Zealand, has an average of 1,219 million viewers.
The criticians were wondering if Thomson himself could pull a television hit without Rafters Rebeccy Gibney.
The result last night says "yes."
The X Factor of Seven has kept strong 1,136 million audiences, thus smoothly defeated The Block (838 000) and TBL families (726 000)
Seven recorded mixed trackings the other night The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of a new TV quiz (from 5:00 to 17:30), which Andrew O'Keefe introduced had a average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 6:00) jumped up to 623,000 audiences — which was enough for a small victory over the Hot Seat of Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of the Chase Australia had an average of 520 000 viewers and the second half of the incredible 720 000.
Hot Seat was about 620 000.
With the decline in the Chase Australia of the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will eventually win at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is replaced by a series of Million Dollar Minute which couldn't defeat McGuir's show.

Three at the final agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is a perfect boy - but who will he choose?
Mystery revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwantedly found out who wins Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood will come to Bachelor is covered by an unbelievable secret.
And three girls who stay standing will definitely not tell who's the real one who gets the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Marcoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows the day before they left just two, thanklessly told us who will win.
Sam Wood holds his tongue to the Thursday Final
All three lyric women sang why Wood is a perfect man, quoted his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when you ask, "If it doesn't, then who gets Wood's final flower?", their answers could work as a spotler about who gets Bachelor's heart.
As Jeavons-Fellows, both Marcos quickly named Mackay as the one that would be best for Wood except them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared a light relationship since one day.
"From the moment I came into the house and watched the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a really landed woman, she's very funny with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and there's the right chemistry among them.
They're good and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood could make a nice couple.
She claims herself that during her last visit home she realized that Wood could be "the right one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a game -- I opened his whole heart now," he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if not her, faced mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can say that," she renounced.
I like both girls as well - it's between Snezen and Lana indecisively.
Bachalor is emitted on Wednesday at 7:30 to Ten.
Originally published as Sarah's best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarrid Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his movement to the United States and many teams asked after his great starting training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul, and it looks like a reasonable decision.
Some coaches left Hayne sitting for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which made the Australian rubbian liga convertity at the first blowout at Tuesday win 20:3 in Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula was also sincere in the game dress.
Instead of chewing the new ones before the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the press conference after the match.
Reporter 49ers, Cam Inman, announced that Hayne was also encouraged by a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the error and to take care of only another game.
During the first quarter against Minnesota Vikings Jarryd Hayne fixed his mistake.
Surely it wasn't the start in which Hayne and his massive Australian fanclub hoped at his NFL debut.
Hayne was captured when he was mistaken to leave the field and later told the Australian Hamish & Andy radio due at 2DayFM 104.1 the worse start of his career in NFL he could not even imagine.
"It happens, you're just focusing on the next game and that's all," Hayne said
Hayne compared the trapas to his original debut in 2007, when the recording in its own branch territory led to the three Queensland.
Totally, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne published a photo with fans on which he holds the Australian flag on his own Instagram.
Elton John and Rus Vladimir Putin will meet in a discussion on the rights of homosexuals
In 2003, the richest man of Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovski, was arrested by guns on the Siberian ranvey.
After he openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovski was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his democratic efforts were limited.
The U.S. has arrived by emigrants who have seeked reimbursement of property.
The two emigrated in 1984 and their property received a new owner.
After 1989, the property could not be recovered, so the couples turned to become a claim of compensation under the law of extrajudicial rehabilitation.
The Court first gave them the required amount, i.e. over 2.8 million crowns, but the Court of Appeal changed their claim by confessing to them only not more than 90 000 crowns with a reference to the amount of the refund is determined under the Price Regulations of 1991.
The Immigrants became the Supreme Court of Justice and put them in charge.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was to pay for the money, has appealed to the US complaint.
In the meantime, a social and economic change has occurred that the refund recognised under the applicable laws - to be the refund of adequate in relation to the property taken - now only reaches a fractional value of real estate.
"This cannot come to the difficulty of side participants as in the restitution of the authorized persons who have pursued their rights since 1995 and who had no possibility of granting a refund before," explained Judge Jaroslav Fenyk, why the U.S. has set up on the side of the immigrants.
"The U.S. has repeatedly expressed that the general courts should proceed in restitutional matters so that any inconsistentities should not be interpreted in the absence of the authorised persons and that the purpose of restitutional legislation is always achieving, thus the remedy of the property offence caused by the acts of the former totality state," the judge added.
Evitu in the musical Study DVA is now created by Radka Fisar.
By the way, Radka Fisar became the world's youngest Evita, when in 1998, in her twentieth year, she made the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Peron in the first Czech introduction of this famous musical Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice in the Prague theatre Spirala.
To return to the same role, he says, "The power of presentation has not yet been balanced to Evita's difficulty."
Evita is not just an amazing role, but it is also responsibility.
The first lady of Argentina recommended it to Monica Absolon.
I saw the monch three times in Evita, and it was definitely inspiring for me.
This is where I suddenly saw a new concept.
I'm a general favorite of more modern adjustments, but this is just a special leader.
"The regent of Ondreje Sokola is original, eager and current," Fisar said.
A substantial transfer of musical singers between the two singers will be held at Monica Absolon's birthday concert on September 27th since 19 hours in the theatre Studio DVA.
Tonight, they'll make the musical of Evita.
The experience will certainly include the common duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Shut your cry, Argentina!).
In a limited number of presentations, Ondrej Sokol will also jump away from the director's office when he represents the film of Karl Roden in the role of President Peron.
For the interest of the public, further deadlines have been added to the sale until May 2016.
The Fifth Czech Study of World Music Evita presents theatre Studio DVA in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
In the režie of Ondreje Sokola, Monica Absolon originally studied the main woman's role.
Her side shows Karel Rodden as President Peron and the role of Che Peter Stranachik.
Legendary songs from the workshop of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech texts Michael Jednojeovski sound in the application of a alive orchestra under the leadership of Christoph Mark, who was already participating in the first introduction in the Spiral theatre.
4 people killed after the cops fired rubber missiles on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in South Nepal after the police shot the rubber missiles into the mass of demonstrators against the proposal of a new state constitution, stated the official in the middle.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmanda.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the Chief of District Officer, states that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered before the police station and some cast stones and burning bombs.
Mr. Dhakal states that the police used a tear gas and then fired before they flew to the rubber missiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber projections known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less mortal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
This conflict was the last week of violent demonstrations throughout the southern mountain of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group Madhési said they had established a new province under the proposed new constitution and reduced their political influence.
Other demonstrations in Western Nepal were also recorded by the ethnic group of Tharus, which requires the creation of its own state.
Since August 10th, at the violent conflicts, at least 40 people were killed, including 11 policemen.
when the four main political parties signed a country division agreement to the provinces — a big step to the new constitution, but a very controversial question in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been in progress since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after a destructive earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators in Kathmand voted on the provisions of the constitutional proposal and officials state that the new chart should be adopted by Sunday.
We must definitely not panic now.
After the losing on the ice of the Ice of Lithuania, you have not even managed to take home duel with Sparta hockeyists (3:5).
Do you not worry about a similar catastrophic entrance to an extraligy like a year ago?
I hope nothing like that doesn't happen again.

NHC predicts 60% probability of cyclone south of the Capverd Islands
The broad low-clock system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the Southern Capverd Islands is likely to have 60 percent in the result of the tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, stated on Tuesday the National Hurican Centre of America.
Another well-defined low-class system, approximately in the middle of the Capverd Islands and Small Antilles, also has 60 per cent of the probability of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, added weather forecast with a seat in Miami.
Google has launched a campaign to choose 11 million dollars for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) stated that it is launching a campaign aimed at selecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations helping thousands of refugees who flooded the European states to escape from the war of dismissed and poor countries. Every choice of Google will double.
Google announced this on his blog in a very unusual way.
The report on her blog was published by Guoglu Rita Masoud's employee on the basis of personal experience, when she fled with her family from Kabul as a seven-year-old.
"We traveled in many dark trains and buses and we experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear," said Masoud.
I was lucky.
But the worsening immigrant crisis in Europe is increasingly more families like that, willing to help.
All contributions will be divided between four non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Refugees.
Google stated that all the contributions made over the Google.com/refugeerelief will double up to $5.5 million.
Europe faces the largest wave of refugees from the Second World War, most of them come from Syria by a four-year war that only expelled 4 million people this year.
Many people also run away from the war of dismissed Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

For mildly obsessive diabetics may be a useful loss surgery
The benefits of losing surgery for mildly obsessed people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say whether slightly obsessed people with type 2 diabetes live longer after the loss surgery than those who are provided with non-surgery treatment.
"The mortality data takes a long time to see," states Dr. Robin Blackstone, expert in the loss surgery, who wrote a guide for a new study of JAMA surgery.
The fainting operations, bariant surgeries use different methods to reduce the stomach.
Reduction of hunger and human body restrictions to absorb food.
During years, bariatric operations have shown to be effective for diabetes type 2, but most of the surveys have been carried out in people with morbid mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the weight ratio of the height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI values 25 or higher indicates the overweight of the person and people with over 30 are considered to be obsessive.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Thaiwan have used data collected from the 2007 study, which deals with two types of bariant surgery - stomach bipass and gastroectomy - in treatment procedures for type 3 of diabetes in people who were mildly obsessed.
The average BMI between those who succeeded in surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 to the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, BMI remained those who were not provided with surgery for diabetes, approximately the same at value 29.
Among patients with surgery, the diabetes was fully solved in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
For comparison of diabetes, only 1 percent were solved in the treatment of the treatment group and partially only in approximately 2% of patients.
Furthermore, the blood pressure control, trigilcerides and "wrong" DLL cholesterol was demonstrated "usually better in the surgery group," authors found.
Researchers also monitored the patient's haemoglobin levels of A1c in the blood that reflects the continuous blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best to maintain below 7%, according to researchers.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c of approximately 9% to approximately 6% decreased.
However, this value remained approximately 8% in the medicinal products treated by the group.
But this better "glycaemic control" -- which reflects in better levels of hemoglobin A1c -- did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bipass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 to 14.2 kg), increased BMI declines (7.4 against 5.1) and A1c haemoglobin (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent) and had a higher probability of diabetes remise (46.9 per cent against 16.7 per cent).
While a new study does not show the improvement of survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from the study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to prolongation of life, says Blackstone from University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to the Swedish study, obsessive people who succeeded in bariatical surgery had about 29 percent greater chances of survival in the next 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although a new study has not shown improvements in survival among patients after surgery, Blackstone says it is a comforting result for people with BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"The right here this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a lower BMI group," he states, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone also further claims that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously after BMI's decline between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to show people the severity of the situation," he says.
I think that once you accumulate these genetic changes that firmly connect their bodies with massive and diabetes, the way back is really difficult.
"It's impossible for all to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to capture all refugees, said Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the nearest east.
The Tibet leader of Buddhists called for the end of violence in refugee homelands.
Dalajlama addressed the issue of a refugee crisis in his speech in the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is a study of ethics at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Great Britain.
He claimed that, under current circumstances, the interest of mankind should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even the continents.
He also emphasized that the response of the Western European countries, no matter how admirable, was inadequate in the refugee crisis in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama commended the efforts of Germany and Austria to solve the crisis, he emphasized that it was just a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is beautiful, but while you will have to think about a long-term solution, how to bring real peace and real development, especially through education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we have to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing violence issues, Dalai Lama also expressed complaints on George Bush after the 11/11 terrorist attack and claims that "the US violent response caused a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in the letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent path.
I know his motives were good, but he used the strength and created unexpected consequences," Dalilama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have taken sanitation in the past 4 years
Toxicological centres around the United States have reported almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children up to 12 years of age, which have absorbed high alcoholic sanitation, according to the Georgian toxicological centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgian Toxicological Centre, the number of uses of sanitation in children up to 12 years reported to control poison centres increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"The children get more frequently to these products and unfortunately there is a percentage of children to be transported to emergency," Lopez CNN said.
Some children drink sanitation intentionally, while some want to make an impression on their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on Youtube show the teenagers how they drink sanitation because of cheap relief.
Reverends reportedly mixed the sanitation with oral water containing alcohol for stronger drinks.
Younger children may be attracted by the attractive smell of the medication.
"The children don't think about what could hurt them," said Lopez.
Many more attractive (healthy) are those who are perfumated.
Distribution is sanitation with strawberry smell, grep or orange, which are very attractive for children.
The ambulance shall include between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol.
Especially in small children, several elbows may mean alcohol poisoning.
"It is one of the high-concentrated alcohol," said Fox 4 station in Kansas City, medical director of the toxicological Centre at the University of Kansas hospital Dr. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn't let a glass of whiskey just like that, but people leave these sanitation means outside and when children get to them, it's a quick way to drink.
Nhajah Russell, a six - year - old girl who recently had eaten up to four lounges of sanitation with the smell of strawberry and was transported for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is a double threshold value considered drunken in adults, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who cared for her in Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhajah spoke inexplicit words and was not able to walk after she arrived in emergency.
The doctors monitored her overnight in a separate child hospital on any brain trauma signs, because the girl fell down and hit her head, says Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, mother of Nhaiah.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or arrange them to be sanitation from the reach of children.
In addition to alcoholic poisoning, some sanitation agents were associated with death.
In 2013, two women from Ontaria died after the swallow of a sanitation agent containing a toxic, non-declarated ingredient.
Medicines believed that the product contains methanol, a death factor rather than ethanol, which was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three students in the fourth year in northern New York planned to poison their "looking" teachers by posting antibacterial products in the room," according to the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and has prohibited their presence in the room.
The police assessed the waste plan as "innocent pushing," and referring to the discipline of the school quarter,
Fama: No disagreement in Celtic Team
Griffiths are talking about a disagreement in Celtic, while Deila admits Hoops are in the wrong place, but he's turning it back.
Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson and Warburton is concerned that new backups from January will disturb the unity of the team.
Dons increase their incentives over Celtic by 5 points
The penalta from the first half of the administration of ADAMA Rooney secured Aberdeen's close victory over Hamilton in Pittodria, which resulted in a five-point step between them and Celtic.
Griffiths deny the talks of disagreement
This situation caused a disagreement in Celtic, which was denied by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his fellow players are not working under any pressure from an increased surveillance in preparations for the fight with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the player is looking forward to it.
Disadvantage in the Scottish title rivalry bores Netherlands - de Boer
Former booker Rangers and former representative of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer claims that the Dutch Football fans lost their interest in Celtic - because there is no competitiveness between them because of the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ambassador of Ajax, says, "In the Netherlands, they are not showing the best of Celtic's matches, and why?"
Because there's no more Rangers.
People here don't just talk about coming back to Rangers.
He's talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the games of the Old Company and not only people in Scotland are watching these games.
I'll turn things back to good, Deila's bound.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic was a little confused, but Norwegian boss committed to turning things back to good.
The defeat of Malm and the next drop of the League of Masters was quickly followed by the defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and is now on the top of the table with a five-point elevation.
But Deila says, "Celtic has already experienced a bad period and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really angry or sad about the current day.
We're in the same way -- but we have to go on.
Indeed, we really need Celtic's support, because it makes the players much better.
Now it's very important to stay together.
Warburton's worried about January's backup
Despite the comments that appeared a few weeks ago and suggested that he had already identified some of his January targets, Chief Rangers Mark Warburton is concerned about the great shopping of aid and insists that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the Ibrox team.
Former head of Brentford says, "The ice window is very different from that summer."
The players coming in the summer have the whole pre-season period for accommodation, which you could see in our own team this season.
The team's doing really good.
Sometimes there is more harm to add unnecessary players to those you really need.
The cross-cutting objective of Celticu Michu suggests retirement
The attacker Swansea Mich, who was connected with Celtic in the transmission window, indicated that after the expiry of his contract, he could retire with Swansea.
Twenty-year-old shooter has two years of trouble with a pinch and couldn't find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA for comments against Neilson.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defense was later cancelled - it was a third red card issued by the judge Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson stands behind his claim and says, "I did not doubt integrity, I did not comment on the performance."
Griffiths committed to avoid Tynecastle
The stubborn Hibbe was strictly punished after he admitted that he was singing a song with a text aimed at the former Hearts Rudolph Scoutsel.
The incident took place in the Roserburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tinecastle in March 2014
"It was about derby and it was a moment of danger," the attacker said and continued, "I can say safely, I can't go back to Tynecastle unless it's in Celtic's dress."
The Council in Tannadice believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United Council still believes in fixing the situation with the current team management - but admits that the decline on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the boy again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes loves for the "ugly victory" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately stick against Hamilton Accies to succeed in the seventh league victory by themselves and a five-point score in front of Celtic to the top of the table thanks to the penalty from the first half of the administration of Adam Rooney.
McInnes says, "There's no team who won anything, whether cups or leagues, without winning this type of game."
Scotland unemployment remains unchanged, while the total UK unemployment increases
THE UNION in Scotland remains unchanged at 164,000 during the period between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The rate of unemployment of Scotland was above the level in the UK (5.5 per cent), as shown by the National Statistics Office (UNS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, the number of employees now stopped to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - which is the number above the British average of 73.5 per cent.
The Secretary of the State of Scotland David Mundell said in the comment on the latest data: "The long-term government plan has laid the foundations for stronger economy."
It's almost an exact year that Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we were witnessing further improvements in the labour market, and the Scottish employment rose while unemployment was declined.
Why I was witnessing the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will watch the death of a man.
If that happens, and I hope that it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a viewing gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Prison and see Richard Glossip who will be executed by a death injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who will witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day is coming, I'm starting to be afraid of it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America and because they are often more requests than free places, there is a morbid lottery that decides who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will be watching the whole execution uninterruptedly.
I can't do that.
I'll sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've made a special connection with him through months of calls and one and a half hour visits.
I like that kid.
We often laugh when we talk to each other.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't have a note block and I won't be able to record what I will see.
I'm just gonna have to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter for compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the parent's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained about her.
She admitted that "this could've been a better formulation," but she still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell a story.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help against death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from Huffington Post, will be next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of subcasts I created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't be sure to say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His acts after Barry Van Trees was murdered would make him guilty of the collaboration on the crime.
But I believe there's a great probability that he's innocent from murder.
I definitely believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think the execution is bad.
And from this perspective, I'll be watching his death.
I can't say I'm really going to be objective.
You can turn to another journalist for this purpose.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing a man I like to die in no use.
The man fled from the Canning River after a police hunter
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after he released the man from the Canning River.
The bet of a man from Petrh to flee the police, didn't go after he got into a minor mud water just metres from a cop who tried to force him to return to the shore.
The Canning Vale Police was called in a incident over to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them through the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I'm not going out, just come get me'," said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec just didn't want to wet his uniform, so he tried to use a safer tactics and the police negotiations."
"People sometimes try to do funny things when they escape," said Castledine.
The soccer champion Ben Cousins gives a memorial example.
In 2006 Cousins went into a car to avoid the bus and tried to swim through the Swan River.
His efforts were worthless, but he inspired the locals to start planning the biatlon of Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody claims that the orderers tried to spy on him and threaten the end of the races
Peeter Moody accused the Racing Victoria that last year they tried to get a spy and threatened that he would immediately end the race.
He focused on the orderer and integrity Division of Racing Victoria and was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with late scratching Lady Tatai at the day of the race, which was the last drop for him in the Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do what is best for race and found himself in a difficult situation about Lidar's positive rubber on a cobalt that he couldn't explain.
He's been biting into the tongue about a spying charge for 18 months, and he didn't want it to look like "such grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about being sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it will come out of you all at once," said Moody.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'll go home today and sleep well.
I want to go upstairs with my head and make the owners think I'm doing the maximum for them.
If they start thinking the opposite, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Before Moody released in his racing.com interview a bomb that the integrity of the department tried to spy on him.
"Before 18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in the room with a man - whom I will appoint after question - and offered him employment in my states for finding out about the things that are being done in my states," said Moody at Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's true, everyone should show their information because they've completely burned me in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of RVL, David Moodie, current President of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current Director-General of RVL, were aware of that at that time and are aware of it today.
Should I think this is a personal matter?
Does RVL keep a couple of balls growing up and arrange people outside the training position to take responsibility for what's going on in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really so bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think they do.
Maybe they need me to take my license and push me away and I have no doubt what I'm saying will give them the material to think.
But I got to the point when I don't care about it anymore, and I'm sad about it.
It really saddened me.
I'll push them and put the burden on them to make a decision.
I have my family's support, and I can leave.
The frustration of the coach has increased with a long-term investigation for cobalt, including Lidari and recent scratches in it, and it has a feeling that "he could watch his license on the table."
The mood, the most famous for the preparation of an unbeaten champion of Black Caviar, marked the rule of treatment on the day of the race as "funny" after the horse's legs were applied by a clay or mud, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of race.
I have to take full responsibility," he said.
Someone in my team mistakenly put a mud on his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it also happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced three-month discvalification for the treatment of the cover on the day of the race for which the orderers have already opened the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who create these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
The Cobrama driver who drove was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit the cyclist in Cobra on the weekend and went away after the collision.
The cyclist was air transported to Royal Melbourne hospital with serious wounds after the car was hit on Murray Valley's main road on Saturday morning.
The police said the engineer left without stopping and helping a wounded rider.
On Monday, a 50 - year - old man from Nathalia himself confessed to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of non-stop in an accident, not providing assistance and other traffic offences.
A ciclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in a hospital in a stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellamy returns the rivals due to wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, Coach Melbourne Storm, criticised the steps of his players as "the setting of plans" by two NRL favorites of Prime Ministership.
Trent Robinson, coach Sydney Roosters, said that the judges allowed the Storm players to "wrestle" his players during the controversial victory of the Storm team at the final qualifications in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, Coach of Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly hidden note on Strorm after his team won the final qualifications over North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game "exact" football ligs and he said two of Queensland were not "too large" on wrestling.
Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said they focused on "Contact."
Bellamy added that this situation has raised his self-consciousness because his team is criticised by two coaches, which may mean that they are afraid of the defeat of Storm.
"I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2," he said in the middle of Bellamy.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything from our defensive system and technology in the last year, and we have only emphasized contact during the interventions, which meant turning to us.
Trent's been here for three years and he's obviously trained a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could be a little shock for him.
It's funny how such things always come into this annual part.
Bellamy disagreed Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's team, St. George-Illawarra Dragons, won the premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about an exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was as exciting as ours. It was also exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticised for being a boring team and Wayne said that he didn't care.
But now he has a team who can play a game style that seems distracting, especially his young bookers with their speed.
Such a football you would like to play if you had this type of players available.
This opinion said in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his football style - but not every team has two bookers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me more self-conscious because they say things like that because they're worried about the fight against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think of us when they were going to big matches.
Bellamy also pointed out the fact that more gates fell in the Storm and Roosters game than in the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos team game was probably good, didn't I look, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two other attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or is it interesting when you leave and don't try?
I think that's the agenda.
If they mention us, that means we'll be meeting again in a stage.
The Storm has this weekend break and wins the right to host North Queensland Cownboys or Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night in AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold in the morning of Tuesday.
Serbian man got bail 200 000 USD for drug charges
A man who faced a possible lifetime for holding 40 pounds of cocaine that was smuggled from Queensland was bailed at $200,000.
Marko Maximovic (29 years) was one of the five men arrested last month by a federal police searching for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, who came from South America through Vanuatu and in August in Coomer.
Maximovic was observed at a meeting together with the accused in the harbor during the morning and later met with them in the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although he was facing the potential sentence of life for possession of commercial quality cocaine, Maximovica's lawyer has set up the defense that there is no proof that he could own all the quantities and that he could be in the coffee in total accident and innocent.
Judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan thought Maximovic would escape.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the middle of the court.
In a crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
The mother and the father of Maximovice offered a bail of $200,000 for his release.
"After reading the vow declarations of both persons, it is obvious that the bail of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts were obviously insufficient, because the accused did not go further in court, warned.
Maximovic was bailed on the condition that he would give up both the Australian and the Serbian passport, he would report to the police every day and will observe the ban on the departure from 18 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
Pedofil used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to get pictures of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she slept, then logged in on her online chat, where he had a lot of rude pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl wake up and found out she missed her phone and then found him in Hog's sleeping hand.
She passed through him and before she warned her mother, she found anxious news.
The police joined and saw five photos, then the analytical computers found the address and discovered a "threatening" search on the web using expressions for searching for immoral pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the cops that his reason was to get pedophiles on the Internet before he "pretend to be a police officer and scare them."
Fiscal representative Eilidh Robertson stated for Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was addiction - that he was dependent on scaring people.
He confessed that he was doing a computer search, but he said he was just trying to pretend he was a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with a stranger who sent him pictures and why he wanted him to send another.
He thinks he's doing it to lure them.
He claims he's screwed up in drunkness and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, "When the girl found messages on her phone, she called her mother, she was shaking and crying.
She saw immoral pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hog, 23, in the Ward Road, Dundee, admitted guilty of the complaint on the adoption or provision of inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, violated the conditions of bail on 25 January and did not reach a hearing in the court on 24 March this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed on a list of sexual offenders, because he could argument that there was no "neither substantial sexual subtext in his act."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed a judgment on October for reporting social workers.
Hogg was bailed in this case, but he was held in custody before hearing about other unsolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sexual offenders before the date of his judgment.
Zimbabwski Robert Mugabe made a bad speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the African oldest leader, fell on the stage stairs earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall became viral in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also distorted by the claims of opposition lawmakers that they received anonymous threats to murders that warned them of the exemption of Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month he was provoked and provoked during his speech on the state of the nation in the parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The Chairman of the Chairperson of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gones, said that seven opposition politicians received text reports on their mobile phones with warning to prevent Mr Mugabe from defending the manifestation of Mr. Mugabe.
"The report comes from a number that will not be displayed but is named 'death'," he told journalists after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
He warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and once it comes from Parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai has "functions" on threats to the Members.
Hewlett-Packard is about to reduce the number of jobs to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cancelled 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within its efforts to restructurate and save the costs of business services.
The HP will later this year be divided into two companies at the market and separate the computer and printer trade from its rapidly growing company hardware and services.
The expected decrease in the number of jobs will result in a change of approximately $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, states HP.
"This restructuring activity will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable costs for new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, Director-General of HP, and Head of the Bureau, which will be head of the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a wide and wide portfolio of businesses that will help businesses move into a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate society, we will be in a much better position to meet the needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have more than $50 billion annual income after the statement of the company and "will be focused on providing non-competitive integrated technological solutions" by companies.
This will take place in the company which was established in 1930 by the Stanford University of Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, manufacturers of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called "Silicon Valley".
HP has been through massive reorganization to manage a movement from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This HP move, the second largest PC producer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest in this sector based on the belief that the specialized company has better results.
Captain Arsenal Michael Arteta says the colleagues must get injured by Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also emphasized Wilshere that it is still only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to the plan, there is no reason to play again on Christmas.
This best scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least four other English games and, from the view of history, his involvement in the next summer European championship is obviously uncertain.
The great shame of this newest problem is that Wilshere ended the last season strong after the cord injury and then again entered the former form during the pre-session.
"This type of injury does not threaten a career," said Wenger.
It's a wound that requires treatment.
It's nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his cords or the injuries he suffered before.
This could be true from a pure medical perspective, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative danger of other injuries any time any player returns during the season.
There's also an unpleasant pattern here.
The survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different wounds of Wilsher since he had his game debut six years ago.
During the last five years, he only played in 65 ligs of Arsenal from total number 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, one of the two Premier League clubs, who lost the most days due to injuries.
Wenger accepts the potential of a charmed circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the area of recorded injuries will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you return after injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition," Wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body is stabilized, I'm sure he'll have a career he deserves.
Arsenal begins a campaign in the Lisa of champions on the middle night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspure next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuh and Arteta will probably join.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and let the players need to breathe," Wenger says.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite to the F group, Maximir in Zagreb has the reputation of the most scary stadium in Europe.
Dinamo was also not defeated in total 41 matches after they held the campaign "invincible" last season.
The stadium was shaking at the middle of the night by quake 3.2 degrees of Richter.
It was this year in Zagreb already understood.
Wenger thinks that the Arsenal learned from the last season of the League of Champions when he капitulated against Monaco and remains his remote hope that the club will lead to the first victory in the European cup.
"This place is awesome," said Wenger.
It never happened to the Arsenal.
In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar views in various shows is beating into the eyes, especially with regard to the need for men to open more desperate than ever, with regard to suicide among young men at 15 years of age.
In 2013 it was the only major cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Britain and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an effort to address this problem, Campaign Against Living Miserable (CALM) 2015 as the Year of Man whose aim is to challenge the culture that prevents men from searching for help if necessary.
The heart of this struggle is a friendship to fulfill this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing depression symptoms revealed that in the case of the damaged one had sufficiently high percentage of friends with “healthy mood”, their chances of recovery have doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents half the chance of having mental problems.
But in order to work, friendship must, of course, be at first available.
In this communication through social media with a emphasis on style and not on the content of the communication, the immediate response is often preferred before meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun loving and more successful, even though we are in reality rather isolated.
This surface success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything to the cost of our real values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a deep influence on our mental health.
And as a billionaire explained recently and a game creator, money really won't buy more happiness.
The beauty of the series of Friends was the source of this thought for him.
None of the figures were defined by their work but by their personalities that shineed through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, the moment of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all the sources of knowledge that yes, men can also be identical with it, even though mostly keep their feelings for themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me: ...."My role in listeners who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Mans who contact us often feel the inability to communicate with friends.
The old term "to deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be considered weak to open problems.
Friends are one of the series that will come up to me when I try to offer a long-term compensation mechanism.
He emphasizes small moments in male friendship.
With regard to my task, the state of the outsider on the phone helps people at times of desperation, but long-term support must come from closer closer, from the network of friends and family.
So if you're going to FrendsFest this weekend, organized by the Comedy Central station, why don't you take your friends to a drink to Central Perk, where the interior for the opportunity to celebrate will be fully reworked.
Or if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile at him and say hello to him.
You never know what difference your friendship can make.
The series Friends will be transmitted at the Comedy Central station from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG move Malmo side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavani after the branch was shot against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored at his debut in Lisa Masters and helped PSG to defeat the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's a match report and a response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in the Tuesday match and Paris Saint-Germain started their journey in Lisa Masters with a final comfortable victory 2-0 against Malmu on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria shot a gate less than four minutes after his debut in Lisa Masters, and this PSG player sent French champions to win, but then they threw a few chances, when Cavani finally raised his intensity when he shot his head in the 61th minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong launch against the Swedish champions, because they focused not only on qualifications in rising wheels, but on improving their journey to the quarterfinal, which they recorded in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they got three points, it wasn't a classic performance of Laurent Blanca and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was marnotratous in front of the gate, and later he was settled against his home team and the club in which he started his famous career in 1999.
"In the League of Masters, it is not easy to win outside or at home, so winning 2-0 makes our opponents trouble and seem comfortable in the defense is a good beginning, even if there are things that we will have to improve with the season procedure," said Blanc.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and win, but I'm sorry we didn't shoot one or two gates more.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury as one of the three changes in the PSG team, which broke this weekend with Bordeaux in Lisa 1, but was shaded by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was marked as a man who moved PSG in Europe to a new level after the transfer from the United Manchester last month, and showed why when he ran on the pass of Marca Verratti in defense Malma and by a beautiful end, he sent the ball behind the back of Johan Wilanda to the remote corner of the gate.
However, if anyone expected it to start a great PSG victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malma, who defeated Celtic in play-off and reached this stage, came with nine internationals in the basic composition and five defenders and two dragged bookers were a heavy competitor.
But besides Nicole Djurdjice's shot, who just passed the remote corner of Kevin Trapp in 34th minute, they didn't offer much in the attack.
Instead, the PSG was considering the benefit of the attack by the bad extracts and the miserable ending, which was not even good from Ibrahimovica, who couldn't shoot five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot arrived in the network shortly after the beginning of the second half of Cavani.
However, he showed himself much more suitable when it came to the preparation of chances for his fellow players, and it was just from his extraction when Di Maria sent a round shot that ended in Wiland’s gate after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after the hour of the game thanks to Cavanim, this Uruguayec sent a head over the line of the sixth goal of this season after Ibrahimovic arrived to him after the left wing from Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts of Malma about the possibility that they could pull something out of the game, and only the excellent action of Wilanda was in a great close failing to the hope of David Luiz and the score remained unchanged even at the time the goal of Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the match.
The coach of the team Malmo Age Hareide acknowledged that PSG was a class higher than his team, Nor said, "Our last game in Liga Masters took place in December last year."
Since then, we played only a Swedish League, which hasn't been on the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
The hat down for Paris.
It was a fantastic game for them.
Glencore earned $2.5 billion for stock sales
The frequent Glencore giant in Switzerland, which was affected by a decline in commodity prices, earned $2,5 billion from the sale of shares within its large debt reduction plan.
In its statement, Glencore states that it sold a new share of approximately 1,6 billion to pay the debt.
This company, which has lost 57% of its market value this year, is facing commodity prices, since the Chinese economic slowdown reduces demand and burns sparks of destruction across the markets.
The problem of rights has sent Glencore's stock price at the top of the London stock market in early morning trades.
The shares jumped by 2.77% to 131,60 pens on the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent above.
Glencore discovered last week that the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion was part of the broader plans to reduce their debt $30 billion, which was accumulated by about a third
The company sold a new share of 123 pensions for the stock, which meant 2.4 per cent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They quit 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 per cent per group.
The concerns about the prolonged braking of Chinese growth decreased the price of iron ore by almost half and coal, copper and other commodities by 20 to 40 per cent.
The White House confirmed that Washington visited Xi Jinping
The Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in his Tuesday report.
The first visit to President Xi in Washington will take place on September 25th in the response of Barack Obama to the visit of Peking, where the president welcomed in November, reported the report.
The American President and First Lady Michelle Obam will invite President Xi and his household Peng Liyuan to the state dinner that will be held after the end of the interviews.
"The visit of President Xi is an opportunity to strengthen mutual relations between the United States and China and encourages cooperation in addressing international, regional and common interests and is an opportunity for a constructive debate on the conflicts of both States," the report adds.
Xi, whose first visit was announced in February, should visit Seattle, where on his way to Washington, he meets several U.S. technical leaders and then continues to New York at the UN September session.
Obama and Xi are expected to deal with disputed problems, including Washington's concerns of the alleged cyberspieneage of China and its growing aggression in the waters of the Southern Sea.
How the refugee crisis scattered the Schengen space.
The urgent light lighter blown away from Germany has not eclipsed the European crew, but he's already forced the ship to change the course, wrote the French Journal of Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to deal with the problem of refugees: it will rather systematically classify migrants and asylum applicants as soon as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than to argue about the future division of refugees according to quotas, based on the quantities that are increasingly departing from reality.
Six days after the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of 28 EU countries to re-separate 160,000 refugees, the Ministers of the Interior of the Member States have changed priority.
Before taking care of the final destination of the runners, it is necessary to filter those who are arriving today and to solve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen space.
"Effective management of external borders of the EU is necessary for migration management," the Ministers discussed in Brussels on Monday emphasizes.
After the common currency crisis, he finds the EU in danger in its next large integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it does not lose its decision and increase pressure.
It renews border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influenza of those looking for asylum in this country.
The central power makes it clear that without it no free movement in Europe is possible.
As evidence, Austria and Slovakia joined this measure on Monday.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and even France also consider it, even though with different intensity.
Hungary has come to this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are acceptable in accordance with Schengen rules.
That it's a dominant effect, but he can see the blind.
The key question for Berlin and Paris is now an effective introduction of mandatory input controls in Greece, southern Italy and Hungary for those who have already passed into the inland.
The French Minister of Interior, Bernard Cazeneuve, and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière, intensively acted during their private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
It's not a new idea, but it's getting cold.
In Italy, unofficial statistics have already been registered and identified by the seizure of two-thirds of new runners.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point in its territory, because they fear more than others that there are camps in which refugees would accumulate on her account.
A real black hole remains Greece.
On his islands near the Turkish coast, more than 200 thousand people landed this year, which was twice as many as they arrived lately in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum applicants who came directly from Syria after they passed over the camps filled in Libanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge zoe hole.
Athens who are still in financial divorce and waiting for a new government put their hands in the knees.
This is the default point for the Balkan path and the source of common concerns for the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban.
Juncker's committee promises that the checkpoints will be introduced as soon as possible, but it has not entered any number or date.
"The calls faced by Greece apply to Europe," the EU Interior Ministers agreed on Monday on this front.
It is therefore to place the European Frontex border control teams in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity for asylum receipt and strengthen the surveillance of the islands.
"The need will be adequate financial resources," warns the text submitted to the Ministers for approval.
In terms of law, they will continue to have the last word of Athens.
The issue of the real European border guards has not been formally raised, but Europe is approaching.
The new emergency situation of the eighth-years, as well as pointed to the second row the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees set up by Juncker's Commission and the European Parliament in the beginning of the year, and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still don't want to hear it.
They consider it an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the obligation, was maintained in the text approved by most of the eighth.
But as a political commitment.
Otherwise, the process is aborted.
The only firm promise includes the re-separation of 40,000 refugees in the next two years, which has already been reached in June during the EU's Hectical Summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under the lawn in the Alps, allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czech and four Germans are among the seven tourists killed by the lavina in the French Alps.
Germany's nationality is also according to the authorities a woman who survived as the only one of the affected eight-groups.
Previous media reports suggested that it was about Polk.
An approximately thirty - year - old woman was severely injured by her leg in the area of the hip bone hospitalized in the city of Briancon.
The dead were created by the AFP mostly by the 40-year-olds.
"The rescue operation is over, also the victim's bodies were transported to Briancon," stated the prefect of the Hautes-Alpes-Alpes Pierre Besnard.
The unfortunate event occurred around the afternoon in the mountain area of Pelvux under the top of the mountain Dáme de Neige des Ecrins measured 4015 meters.
"The sudden lavina was 250 meters wide and high about a meter," Nicolas Colombani head noted.
He said that about 3900 meters of snow was a huge quantity of snow on the eighth group.
Meteorological services today did not warn in the area against uncomfortable weather.
Trupishovski before the Braga match: Finally the real Europe.
Coach Jindrich Trpišovski was able to go through the European Leagues to the basic group with his prime minister in cups and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
The Slovenian welcomes the finalist of 2011 Bragu and, according to the coach, he wants to force her game style.
After all the nerves in the rival fights, when every goal and any situation could dismiss you on your way to a dream group, we're now there and we're going to play six matches.
Of course, we want to win, but we don't have to be afraid of every incased gates, we can play our tactics, and we are not bound by just a double match.
"I'm very looking forward to it and it's true Europe, before it was only qualification," Trpišovski said at the press conference.
Bragu considers the top team.
It will be very active, they have the same Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The competitor may be harder to say that he has no name, but in his case, he has a player who knows Manchester was giving three goals.
"It is a great total at top team level," said Trpišovski.
But Braga doesn't think it's a clear favor.
I think we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have shown that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm this," said the coach whose team lost the 11 duels of this season only the introductory Super cup in Plzni.
They believe that Liberec can force Braze to make his style.
The team is waiting for us to be strong on the ball, and it is not typically disciplined for them.
They're playing from the 4-4-2 layout with a rapid transition to the stage of attack.
"It is a very difficult opponent, though we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players will do it on the field," said Trpišovski.
We have studied a lot of rivals in the fronts, which has helped us very much, this time we want to focus on our game, which we have adapted to training.
"And we definitely want, even though it's very difficult to play according to our notes," the coach added.
Student movies control the Sand, the international festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries this year have reported their work to the 15th year of the International Student Film Festival in Pesco.

By sixth year, it took place once for two years.
In the event of the CK fall, the insurance companies shall place the customers' rights in full.
Insurances should build the customers' rights when the travel office falls in full.
The House decided on this on Wednesday, when it approved the adjusted novel of the law on the conditions of business in travel.
Travel offices will be able to replace the insurance against the decline of the bank guarantee, according to the proposal to assess to the Senate.
Insurances with the obligation to retain customers' privileges even above the agreed limit shall not agree.
The Ministry of Local Development insists, proposes protection of consumers.
Insurances have already threatened to terminate travel office insurance against collapse when the novel is paying.
But the proposal also criticizes travel offices.
Because without insurance, they will either have to end or leave abroad.
The Ministry of Local Development Karla Plecht (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance did not pay full refunds are not Eurocomform.
It noted this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client has the right to full reimbursement of the money, regardless of the limit of insurance.
Insurance providers will receive enough information on the management of travel offices and will be able to determine the correct limit, emphasized the Pleasure.
"We appreciate the efforts to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be implementable," opposed Vice-President Top 09 Miroslav Kalusek.
The bank guarantee is not going to work because no one gives it unlimited.
"The travel offices will have to complete or move their activities to abroad," Kaluzek warned.
Member of the Presidency of the Czech Travel Office Association and Tomio Okamura (SPD) with Kalusic cares on the basis of the investigation between the CK Members.
"Wait us showing lobbing insurance," he said.
The insurance statement does not refer to Okamura as relevant, no official written expressions in that sense exist.
They say they will find out if the travel offices will cooperate, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
She also warned the provisions of Jana Fischer (ODS), which refered to the opinion of the Competitive Travel Association of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Peter Bendl, who spoke about the erasing of stairs by the Czech travel offices.
Travel offices according to Fischer will not be able to negotiate insurance.
"The consumer protection works," judges Fischer.
Her proposal for the release of a controversial passage, the House did not approve.
Neither did Vojciech Philip (KSCHM) with a proposal to revert the proposal to the Committee for the alleged contradiction with the civil law.
Philip pointed out to travel agencies that, according to him, could threaten consumers.
In view of the Constitutional Court's judgment, the rapporteur of the draft Martin Berdich (ANO) withdraws its proposal that would limit the liability of insurance in cases where they could not know that the insurance fulfilment would not cover the entire risk.
In the novel, the minimum four-million insurance limit for travel offices offered by air carriers will not be originally proposed and a million-limit for offices selling bus trips.
The border will remain at 30 per cent of the planned sales markets from the sale of railways.
However, the insurance limit will have to be such as to cover all customers' privileges in the event of a decline in the travel office.
Norma, even after the amendments, states that travel agencies will have to reiterate which travel office is organised in the selling trips.
Travel offices will be required to provide insurance before the contract is concluded, inter alia, information on the economy and number of races.
The approved amendment proposal of the Public Administration Committee also counts on further regular information on insurance.
Travel offices will be required to provide them every month with data on the number of passengers and sold tours, the total prices of sales travels and the amount of reserves and markets for travel and for incentives.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds out that the travel office has not fulfilled any of the legal obligations to the insurance, it will invite it under a proposal for repair or it will be able to prohibit the closure of new contracts in case an infringement of the obligation could compromise the interests of the customers.
Novela is also to revise the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of grants to the mountain service on the basis of its request that it will always apply by the end of April for the next year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money last year, a financial expenditure plan and a view for the next two years.
According to the Association, the lawmakers did not figure out what would happen if the insurance confessed the CK contract.
It won't be allowed to manage the trips, and the customers who bought the trip before the insurance exemption would lose it according to the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may also disturb, although its economy was in a good condition.
One of the possibilities for such a situation can be addressed by the travel offices will be the suit for the refund.
Another option will be to go to abroad and to use much softer conditions in abroad, and then we will act only as agencies in our market, said the Vice-President of the Association of Jan Pope.
The draft of the novel has also contained a bank guarantee institution, but it is so unreasonable that it cannot be implemented at all in practice, as the bank guarantee cannot sound unlimited.
According to the Association, alternate practice of de facto is unnecessary.
In the horizont of two years, the EU's new Directive will need to reconstruct the entire law.
On the Czech market, it is now operating a total of 942 active travel insurance offices.

Merkel: We need to improve the conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must settle on improving humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Libanon to limit the arrival of runners to Europe.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced it after negotiating with German Earth Prime Ministers.
At the same time, she again appealed to the division of refugees who have already arrived in the EU, among the eighth-year countries.
We need to help more to countries where refugees leave, wherever they are delayed after leaving the country.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will settle on dignity conditions in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Libanon, the German Chancellor said that such a signal might also include higher financial assistance or excessive EU cooperation with international humanitarian organizations.
"The United States also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to the European country," Merkel further said.
Earth Prime Minister Braniborska Dietmar Woidke said in this connection to the press conference that he expected real solidarity from all EU countries.
The EU's division of runners on the basis of quotas has been rejected for a long time, inter alia, by Czech Republic.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke to accelerate asylum management in Germany.
People need to know if they have a chance to stay here as soon as possible.
It is also necessary for the authorities to begin more quickly with the integration of foreigners, said the Branch Prime Minister.
It also states that the majority of the money that Germany is spending on running is needed to be incorporated in those who have a chance to gain asylum.
It'll take more teachers to handle German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the runners are able to integrate, they can become a benefit for us, he said.

Caldiero provided an interview for the reporting E! News immediately after his hard-related victory and was realized that he was still in shock of the winning of the main price of $1 million.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never earned more than 10,000 dollars a year in my life," Isaac E! said in response to my victory.
"So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it's going to be."
The executive producer Kent Weed provided an interview with the Hollywood Reporter on the course of the final and why Britten won't gain any reward even despite the fact that he became the first competitor that the track finished.
Because according to the rules, the money belongs to the one who finishs the trail as fast as possible.
"If more competitors participate in the tracks, the winner wins with the best time," Weed said.
Even though the profit of the primary victory changed his life, Britten is satisfied with his performance.
"I don't think he would be a mad man.
He's glad he was able to achieve what he did.
He's got a warm reception from his fans.
He's a great guy and he likes his family.
He's a hero for his children and a woman."
Geoff told me: “If there was someone who could be defeated me, I am glad it was Isaac. ”
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season that begins to film on spring 2016.

There may be a new bed department in the Karlovar County.
According to the Deputy Heitman of the Karlovar County, Jacob Vavika (CHSSD), the current capacity of the bed offices of two district hospitals and two private hospitals in the region should be done on the basis of the agreement between separate hospitals.
But there are also options for enlargement of care in the area.
For example, a single day surgery centre could be established in the surgery department where the surgery performances that do not require hospitalisation for more than 24 hours are performed according to the concept set.
In which specific hospitals the workplace aimed at one-day surgery should be, yet it is not clear.
In the leather department of Karlova Vara, laser centre could be regenerated with the possibility of using laser technique for skin disease.
The concept also recommended the formation of the Apal center that would be concerned about patients with brain infected with vegetative condition.
Such a centre should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiological and resuscitation department.
There is also a possibility of concentrating such equipment into the island hospital where there is already similar care.
Another bed capacity, which appears inadequate in the Karlovar County, is the bed of the next care, especially the bed of the Medicine long-term patients (LDN), whose capacity in Najdek is insufficient and should be closely tied to the bed of acute care.
Part of this device should work as a rehab bed and part as a classic LDN bed, recommends concept.
As he warns, the next care bed is missing mainly in Karlova Vara hospital.
There could be a use of the abandoned buildings after centralization.
In the latest row in the Karlovar County there are socially health beds with focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
These beds are deficiencies throughout the Republic, so it could serve for other regions as so-called Alzheimer Centre.
The hospitals should, according to the recommendation, be prepared for the introduction of so-called inflammatory beds to which the funds of European grants will be released.
"One of the beds that will be tied to surpassed care and will form a space for the transposition of patients after the operation, for example, after cardiac, neurosurgery, transplantation or other treatment," the district concept of bedcasts described.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
