Black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the dissolving road networks, many begin to see solutions in a small black box that easily enters your car's machine.
The devices that monitor every mile away from the engineer and transmit this information to the authorities are the core of the controversial efforts of Washington and the State Planning Authority to renew the older system for the financing of US main roads.
Usually, the fatal road designs suddenly incited an intense debate and the formation of various communities.
Libertarians met with eco-groups and lobbyed so that the government could use these small boxes that would record miles and perhaps where you are going – and then it would be used to draw up tax dimensions.
The tea party is terrified.
The US Union for Civil Freedoms is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of private protection problems.
And while Congress can't agree whether to continue, some States are not waiting for anything.
They shall see how they can move to the system in which the driver pays for a mile of the road he drives over the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have been watched using GPS, for testing.
This is a real need for our people.
"It is not a matter where we can choose much," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the South California State Administration Association, who plans to start tracking miles from each Californian motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology serves to do so.
The Road Lieutenant Fund funded from taxes paid by the Americans at pump stations is on the bottom.
The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
The cars ride a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians do not want to raise tax even by one cent.
"The tax from gasoline is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert in Minnesota University.
His state has recently placed a tracking device into 500 cars to test this payment system for a mile away.
"In a long term, it appears to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of miles.
It is not surprising that this idea likes urban liberals because taxes can be used to change the driver's behavior patterns, which, for example, can help to limit transport trap and greenhouse gases.
California designers view this system in planning strategies to fulfil the objectives set out in the ambitious global warming laws.
But the Republican Bill Shuster (Pensilvania), the President of the Transport Committee, said that it was also the most functioning long-term alternative.
The representatives of the free market from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for miles.
"It is not a tax that disappears in the black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president for the Reason organization strategy.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US Ministers of Transport, who encouraged Congress to pay a mile in 2011.
The US Senate approved a pilot project for 90 million USD, which would include about 10,000 cars last year.
The leadership of the House of Representatives, however, rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural lawmakers representing the inhabitants whose daily life often means to offend many miles away from the city.
However, several countries and cities are moving forward to their own hands.
The worst is Oregon, who included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying taxes to the state, instead of gasoline tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is just looking into the project.
Illinois is trying to do this at a limited rate in cars.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transport, together with the coastal countries in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
This concept, however, is not only an advocate.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor every movement.
"The concerns of the type of Big Brother and similar matters were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who runs management of the strategy and operation in the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the test project continued, the American Union of Civil Freedoms in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to transform these devices into a full-value monitoring device. ”
There is no need to build a huge heavy technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand on the records of daily exits and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada belongs to several countries who are trying to find available technology that would enable the State to monitor how many miles the cars will reach, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be more calm.
The hunt has led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (real defective distance).
This company was not initially involved in the government's assistance in taxing drivers.
She wanted to go through the emerging market with legal liability insurance where the drivers would pay on the basis of how much they'd drive.
But this device that is trying attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and only provide limited amounts of information that are regularly recorded using modem.
"People will be more willing to do this if you do not follow their speed and position," says Ryan Morrison, executive director True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, a number of major mistakes occurred.
They're much cheaper and less intense ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a GPS device or no GPS device.
Or they shall not take any equipment and instead decide to pay the standard fees based on the average number of miles of all citizens of the country.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will access this concept if the device is able to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are trying to develop tax equipment that would be equipped in order to allow additional fees to be paid at parking hours to provide insurance in accordance with the miles covered and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so that motorists can avoid transport trailing.
"The motorists will be willing to participate in this for the value of the benefits they are offered to them," the city project document states.
However, some transport designers would like to know whether all the payment discussions for a mile are not just a giant major problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the area of the Bay of San Francisco say that the Congress could easily solve the problem with the bankruptted Road Relief Fund by increasing gasoline tax.
Single or annual tax could be placed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not need much fuel, so they will pay the fair share.
"No radical operations are needed when we take aspirin richly," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee for Legislative and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
For the CHSSD, the Saturday negotiates.
Social democracy is talking together, people and grandmothers, and they are making a common procedure.
If social democrats argue within a few weeks, they will sit at the work table with perfectly played partners who will put on the table a complete list of requirements, including ministerial posts.
The messengers of the CHSSD then either swallow acid coalition grapes, or a quantum for a minor government.
After four days of his sympathy, Godslav Sabotka first hit him.
Yesterday, he was unable to control the political mushroom and mainly force the perpetrators to resign.
A confirmed negotiator for the party is yet only he, and other members of the team will be allowed until the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (OHR).
I apologize to the members of the grapes, and now even to citizens.
Not to lie, in personal life or in the public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Hašek, after the negotiation of the highest leadership of the social democracy.
He added that the first vice-president's post was not lying.
"I will inform my decisions on November 10th," said Hašek.
Similarly, the Vice-President of ČSSD Zenok Skromach and the chief of the Jeronim Tejc Chairman.
But he warned that he was elected only two days ago.
The two Members then declared that they would do everything to make the 50-year Club of ČSSD sound in one voice.
He put the crown Michal Hašek on the absurd theatre by saying: "I am a member of the CHSSD 15 years, I have always been loyal to her mark and respected the decisions of the parties."
It's another lie in direct transmission.
Or did he, in the invitation to Saturday's resignation and his dismissal from the negotiating team, forget that August's OBV was 57 per cent of the fact that Godslav Sobotka is a party's candidate for the Prime Minister?
The Chief of the CSSD, however, has made a powerful army of enemies by calling OBV next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media by dreaming of various argues and fams, eventually remind the real mistakes of the Sobota political career.
It's going to be powerful to wash dirty laundry, and there will be signs of dark alliance between the Zdenek Bakala and the Saturday Wing.
A friendly relationship will be discussed by Godslava Sobotka and the influenced lawyer Radk Humble.
Disputes are exploded in the South Sea or Moravic Organisation of the ČSSD.
The words of the island Primator and the Sobotk Alliance Peter Kainar are: "I signed Chart 77 so that the country is not controlled by idiots."
If the OBV met this weekend, liars would probably be forced to sacrifice their functions ritually.
Traitors will sype their head with ashes and stay.
And the winner chief of the CHSSD will end with the nickname of Godslav Pyrrh.
Martin Doctor on problems with OH in Socha: Communication with Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth mark a smile and then deeply breathe, "It's difficult."
Cooperation with the Olympiad organization team in Sochi 2014 is a little complicated according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget what was on the last Olympiade.
"Nothing doesn't work the same way," said the Czech Olympic Mission chief.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower, not exactly.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, not so much in terms of the supply of information about essential things.
For three months, perhaps, we have been trying to give us how the individual villages are officially marked, so that we can do a number of things according to this.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating the thing.
There's a number of things they're still communicating.
Is the Olympic village at least delivered?
But it's not a catastrophic state anymore.
We walked in empty rooms a month ago.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Do you need the floors ready?
It's just a basic concrete, so that's the situation a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even though there's a danger of coming there on 26 January as a front, he'll still feel the glue there.
And if they don't run, what's going to happen?
President Putin would have put the army in there?
That's exactly how it's gonna end.
Just so that it wasn't that the Olympic village = the rudder village.
Rather, they're threatening that they can't make a road adjustment, but they don't do the details.
Maybe they're going to get their ways in such a state that we're gonna have to take the sticks from the London games.
But I believe they're gonna make it a big deal.
How many Czech sportsmen could go to Sochi?
Now there are approximately 78 of them, even though according to the nomination criteria, the number changes.
Maybe the cartooners will probably ride in the trinity they left.
No one also has to doubt about the runner Martina Sablik, but otherwise it's in development.
You're still waiting for a trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there until January 26th.
As the houses are going to look in the Olympic village, we know.
We even measured some things by meter by ourselves so that we could not believe only the drawings.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what's the head of the mission doing 100 days before the Olympic games?
I am preparing for an annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am making a common agenda in terms of communication with the organizational committee in Socha.
Putin promised an ecological olympiade, the plan is taking his giant secret puzzles.
The winter sports fans are already shaving a meter to the beginning of the Olympic games in Socha, others see their preparations with increasing fears.
The Russian Olympiade will start in February, for it is dealing with another scandal.
The Russians are probably unable to fulfil their promise that preparations and games will not interfere with nature in the Krasnodar district in the Caucasus, where thousands of sports and tens of thousands of visitors will be headed in four months.
Otherwise, after the olympiade in Vancouver, the Russians had a very high-level patch, the Canadian games entered the history of the Olympiada as the most visible to the environment.
However, it seems that the Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to organize the games with "null waste" has taken over a long time ago.
Reporters of the AP agency discovered a giant stock of construction material in the village of Achstir near Sochi last week.
So, a stock full of construction material, tyres, canisters, and isolation pens found an ecologist in August, which was immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have disappeared.
Just for a while.
Last week, a view of the three football fields was given to the reporters.
It's not the only one in the area of such places, describing the British newspaper The Times.
There are Russian railways, a state monopoly, which builds about sixty-million-metre road between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
The subject, which already swallowed 280 billion rubles, led one of the close Putin colleagues Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways defended that a subcontractor was founded.
But the local inhabitants are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achstir, the trucks full of waste material are riding around all of them for three months and nights.
According to experts, the waste is contaminating the local river Mzymta, other streams, and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates societal water sources for the next ten to fifteen years," said the British newspaper Vladimir Kimaev from the EWNC ecological non-profit organization.
The illegal stocks are not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympiad in history, opposedly, is one big tunnel.
For comparison: games in Sochi will cost $51 billion, while the summer Olympiada in Beijing 2008 has reached 43 billion.
Last year, the games in London were only 19 billion and the vancouver nine billion mentioned.
In addition to corrupt scandals, project delays and concerns, if the snow is finally enough, the reports also appeared that human rights are not respected at the sports exhibition and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers put his mouth on the protest that he didn't get paid for two months.
Many are also afraid of the way Russian organizers meet with a new law that prohibits promotion of homosexuality during the games.
Some visitors are about to support Russian gays on the olympiade.
A young couple grew up to living with parents, a new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates received as an assignment to propose a house on a parcel that lies on the corner of two streets, while the land itself is considerable somehow.
The requirement was that two generations will live in the house that would like to live together, but each should have its own clear separate space.
A younger couple needed a little office.
The house is on the corner of two streets and on a mildly tangible land.
The architects therefore decided to place every house in one of the floors of the house.
"We respected family bonds, history and memories associated with the place."
"Three different functions of the house are connected in several ways through the outer object, so they all realize the presence of others, but they have their privacy," explain designers.
The parent's household is at the garden level with an old pine, which is important to family traditions and memories.
Single parts of the house are easily recognized outside, because different are different from the final adjustment of fasadas.
While the main segment of the building is of concrete, whose surface was formed by panels from the boards, the part where the office is rejected is white and the remaining elements remained in a clean concrete execution without any other adjustments.
Many of the walls of the house are completely scratched, which makes the interior of the house very connected with the exterior.
The home of parents, the precise kitchen, the dining room, and the living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The interior connection with the exterior underlines the side wall that begins in the garden and continues until the living room.
A kitchen space in the house of a young couple.
A young couple enters the house by the main entrance to the hall and then climbs up the stairs into his room.
The stairs are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their structure allows them to fall through a lot of natural light.
This is what the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and impress something unique to him.
The house of the young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen part, dining room and living room together.
From the terrace, only a glass wall with a slide door divides it.
A living zone with a dining and kitchen part in the house of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space that freely moves to the terrace, where there is a nice view of the Tokyo Bay.
The office itself in the highest floor is linked to a clean combination of white and black colors.
The staircase is the dominant element of the house's interior.
A young couple enters the house by the main entrance, appears in the entrance hall and then goes upstairs from here.
Protect academic freedoms, it's true for Zeman and ODS.
I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, teachers and high schools in several areas to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign held by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I've met with more or less success.
Rector of the University of Masaryk in Brna, who rejected the presentation of the Prime President of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received revenge in the form of no invitation to celebrate the Czech Republic's state holiday.
Here is a list of school representatives who were no longer brave and visited Miloše Zeman: High Technical Learnings in Brna, Gymnazium Gladnov in Ostrava, High Business School in Ostrava, Trade Academy in Colin, University of J.E. Purkina in Usto nad Labem.
We are now meeting in Pardubica with the continuation of policy promotion in high schools.
The newly elected Member for ODS, the dean of the Faculty of Electronics and Information of the University of Pardubica, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic function and also seems normal.
Mr. Professor, it's really not the same as if you stayed in the office of the mayor of a small town.
Do you want to join the Hythmans of the CHSSD who contemporate the function of the Member and the Heitman, and as they degrade both calls?
Because you tell people that both these difficult functions can be handled on the left back.
I know, we have a example of Michal Hashk, who can handle even a few dozen functions at once.
But that's probably not the example of a person you should follow.
We will also find a opposite and positive example of the MUDR. Stephanka, who prefers to leave the post of the Members so that it can be fully devoted to the leadership of the city of Pardubica.
But the main reason why I recommend to leave the Dean's function is that you will violate the apoliticity of the academic soil of the University of Pardubica.
The leadership of the pardubical ODS see your current impact on both posts as the advantage of the University.
But your school will be able to help you without being a dean.
I think your students will have a similar opinion like me and the rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your retreat and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may be able to get the voters to count on you in the next elections.
And it doesn't have a long time.
In Kunovic, the bowl of grain, the chemicals don't add to it
More than a thousand tonnes of oxygen soil they want to make in the next months in Slovak Fruta Kunovica, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season started here in October, and it's going to take about six months.
He's been making a healthy flavor here since 1925 in a traditional way, so screwing directly in big dance.
In modern industrial times, it's about rarity.
Our employees will find them on a shift of nearly a dozen-meter route.
Each of the ten tanks includes 15 to 30 tonnes of salt, filling one takes three shifts," the Slovak Fruta Fruta David Cladroba said.
The heads of the salt are driven to the area of society directly from their fields, mainly from Ostrisk and Brzeclavska.
Fruth's employees then clean up the vegetable, remove the squirrels and throw them into the circle.
From there, the already coated soil falls into pools with six-metre depths, in which they work tiredly, dressed with white clothing and blankets.
They're making the air undesirable.
The last scratched layer of soil is covered with sail and burdened with water.
"The green circle then rays six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk quashing without any supplementary supplementary quasition," emphasized Director Cladroba.
The natural process corresponds to the production in domestic conditions, individual layers of workers spill salt and kmine.
The soil is traveling to the filling line after wet.
It is packed in sweet acid powder in bags or glasses and is subjected to sterilation.
Hamé delivers oxygen soil primarily to the territorial and Slovenian market.
It is also registered in some other countries, such as Great Britain, Ireland, and Canada.
Snowden is willing to cooperate with Germany in connection with monitoring by the U.S.
Edward Snowden, an American reporter, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to submit evidence to the German Parliament, unless the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were able to provide answers to the questions of their activities.
German Ambassador Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was given asylum, and was dealing with him about the possibility of witnessing in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, who was transmitted to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: “Although the result of my efforts was proofly positive, my government continues to be opposed as a fugitive and attempts to criminalize political expressions by hard complaints that do not provide a place for defence.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believes that the support of the international community could persuade the government of the United States to withdraw the charges of criminal offences against him.
The charges issued by the United States Ministry of Justice include spying and stealing state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, said to Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to allow it.”
The tension between the United States and Germany began to rise when the claim that NSA was listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of the parliamentary panel who observes the reporting, said that if there was a chance to interrogate Mr. Snowden as a witness, "without the danger and completely destroyed relations with the United States," it should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a Member of Parliament on the German side of the Greens, published a photo with Mr Snowden on his Twitter contribution.
On his journey to Russia, two German journalists accompanied him.
Mr. Sträbele said that, according to the former NSA contract lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he once left.
If Mr Snowden witnessed in Germany, he would need to be assured that there will be "safe", said a member of Parliament.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a rough and persistent campaign in connection with persecution that forced him to leave his home.
He said, however, that the world’s response to his “act of political expression ” gave him courage.
Citizens throughout and high officials, including those in the United States, have assessed the disclosure of an unreasonable system of public-service monitoring everywhere.
The letter includes the offer to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved".
Killing us is sorry, but we're innocent, defending the representatives of the Red Khmers
Nuon Chea was number two in the hyerarchy of Red Khmers and Khieu Samphan is the former head of the state.
By the Governments of Red Khmer, which was based on the mixture of maoism and nationalism from 1975 to 1979, life was lost because of famine, famine, disease, torture, and execution of more than three million Cambodians, thus at least a quarter of the population of that time.
This commander had granted the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia for the 2010 for life.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charges of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, slavery and murders.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they acted in the best interest of the nation and had no idea what the real scope of killing was.
"It's easy to say that I had to know everything, understand everything and therefore to intervene and fix the situation," said Khieu Samphan on Thursday before the court.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said that he never ordered Red Khmer's caddars to "behave badly with people or kill them to deny their food or genocide."
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to apologize sincerely to the public, victims, their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-fifty-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives in the Red Khmer regime, told the AFP that the apology of Nuon Chea could not be accepted."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be released."
"Don't care about the others," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subjects would not kill," she added, "the leaders of the Red Khmer are " worse than the monster."
It was also to stand before the court of the "foreign Minister" regime of Red Khmer Ieng Sary, who died this year in March.
His wife Ieng Thirith, the former Minister of Social Affairs, in September 2012 the court found an incompetent process for demention.
The leader of the Red Khmer Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to repay manual bags
Frontier Airlines plans to account for the amount of up to 100 USD for saving the manual bag on board at its age.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee up to 100 USD for the hand bag and 2 USD for coffee or soda, although in their announcement on Wednesday, they said that passengers would be able to keep the whole pencil.
The new supplies for the manual suitcase relate to the luggage in the upper storage area, so the small luggages under the seat will continue free.
Frontier says that it will account for 25 USD if the fee is paid in advance, and 100 USD, if travellers will wait until the gate arrival.
The speaker's company Frontier Kate O'Malley stated that a 100-dollar fee is to encourage travellers to take care of payments forward.
"We don't want to pick this fee," she said.
The airlines began to pay the first and second supplies in 2008.
The travellers tried to avoid these fees and put in manual bags hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often no place in this area.
The fees are one of the ways to learn passengers to take less things on board.
O'Malley said that the sense of this new fee really isn't getting more money.
The point is that the most loyal customers of the Frontier have made themselves clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is increasingly difficult.
The travellers who buy tickets on the company's website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in the front of the gate of the Frontier can bring a trunk for which nothing will pay, while the other passenger in the queue will pay 100 USD for the same bag.
O'Malley said that Web sites and removal procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers will learn about the fee before their arrival to the gate.
The new Frontier fee for the hand bag will not yet be valid before the summer, but the date has not yet been established.
The travellers often complain about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
He claims that the manipulation of the bag is worth money, and the passengers who require this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider another suitcase as a sign that airlines are trying to choose enough money to cover air traffic costs after years of loss.
But most of them did not reach the charges for the manual suitcase.
The Spirit Airlines first paid the manual suitcase three years ago and another low-investment company Allegiant Air later followed its example.
The only company that also has such fees is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says the air transport advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the company Spirit's manual baggage fee would bring 50 million USD annually.
Sorensen, former head of Midwest Airlines, recently flyed with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when the travellers met with an unusual Spirit fee for the hand bag.
"The flying to the plane was the most flexible thing I've ever seen in my aviation career," he said.
I was expecting to see a teeth scratch at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, “and the event took place in a moment. ”
Frontier will also apply fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice according to the Spirit model.
Frontier stated that passengers who get limonade or juice can keep the whole pipe and coffee will be free.
The water will continue to be used free.
In 2008, the US Airways tried to introduce drink fees shortly, but after the complaints of the passengers from that seven months later, no other significant airline was imitated.
The last move of Frontier to repay the hand bag if the passengers do not buy a flight directly from this airline, it is its last effort to direct customers directly to their website.
Aviation companies pay Internet travellers such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 USD for each sold ticket.
This encouraged all airlines to lead travellers to shopping directly from them, instead of to do it through Internet travel agencies.
However, the Frontier has gone farther in this area.
In September, she began to give to customers who bought through the Internet travel agency only half a mile within the loyalty programme.
In the middle, she cut a reward for a mile of 25% miles from the road.
So the journey with Frontier is a thousand miles long purchased through the Internet travel agency means a remuneration of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly through Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in Denver's hometown, but its business is starting to crush and waste money.
According to the financial results listed in the middle by the Airways Holdings markets decreased by 9 per cent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter.
The company of the Republic is trying to solve Frontier's financial problems by selling this airline.
NSA does not blame hackers for the fall of the NSA website but "internal error"
The Secret National Security Agency stated last Friday that its websites fell on a few hours last week because of an internal error, not because of the hacker attack, as some claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov pages were not available this evening for several hours due to an internal error that occurred during regular update," the spy agency said in an email declaration.
The problem will be removed during tonight.
The claim that the deficit was caused by the DDoS (distributed refusal of services) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online servers recorded that NSA websites were not working at least six hours and are still unavailable for some users.
The former NSA speaker of the ABC News station reported that the internal sensitive networks of the agencies were “not at all” threatened.
The speaker said no secret information was threatened.
At least one group of hacker activists on the Internet claimed that it was responsible for the exclusion of NSA pages through the DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood target websites with information until the servers are loaded and the page falls.
This cyber tactics is relatively simple and the sense of attacks is not to enter the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA supersecret agency, once acquired a nickname No such a agency, became after the last few months of discovery of foreign and domestic monitoring programs in the center of public attention and targeting bite criticism, a total of the deception of the NSA secret files from the agency and their ex-fearing disappointed former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has inspired earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of targeted cyber operations.
The profit of Bombardier has fallen as a result of the decline in supply and orders.
The Canadian producer of aircraft and trains Bombardier reported on Thursday a 15% decrease in net profit resulting from a smaller number of orders and supplies of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the train unit.
Bombardier also has not published any air test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it offered current information about whether this plan will hold an ambitious plan to start a commercial operation since the next September.
After the starting test flight, about a month and a half of the plane flew only three times, and the question was whether the test phase was doing well.
The results did not fulfil the estimates and the stocks in the Toronto bureau fell by 8 percent.
The State Bank analyst Cameron Doerxen reduced on Thursday the rating of the “increasing profits” to the “production of the sector” with the expectation that the market will experience limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"With the smaller aircraft delivery we expected mostly, the profit rate in transport has significantly disappointed us," said Doerxen in the client's report.
With how the test program will continue, we believe that Bombardier will receive new orders from CSeries.
However, if no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we assume that market scopes will grow towards this programme.
The Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will be invaded into the lower market area which now dominates Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was discovered in March and after a monthly delay in September the first year.
However, the number of compulsory orders of CSeries reaches the modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the claims of the company concerning low consumption and savings on the costs of this aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and obligations from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected that, when the first aircraft was introduced into commercial use, Bombardier would reach its target of 300 mandatory orders.
The leaders also assured the analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme is working according to the plan.
"The test plane has not remained on the ground longer than it was expected," he said in the conference call of Beaudoin and noted that the tests on the ground and software updates were planned during the aircraft's post.
Every manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to graduate first year and then focus on updates, and we did it.
This will happen during the whole flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five testing planes should fly in the coming weeks and the others shortly after.
However, the analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer could start running the CSeries plane 12 months after his first flight.
The Bombardier claims that it has assessed its plan of putting the aircraft into operation and will provide updated information in the next months.
“This slow rate of flight tests – although it is in accordance with the internal plan of Bombardier – will apparently strengthen our opinion that the introduction will be moved to the first quarter of 2015," Doerxen said.
From 172 million USD, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, the net profit of Bombardier on 147 million of USD, or 8 cents per share in the third quarter ending September 30th.
The adjusted income for one share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turning marginally fell from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to the IBES system, Thomson Reuters analysts expected 10 cents per share and turn 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft producer stated that, compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier, only 45 aircraft were added during the quarter.
Clean orders fell from 83 planes to 26.
Incomplete contracts in the air division were formed by 30 September 32.9 billion, which does not change to 31 December.
"Aviation results were in line with our views, but the low receipt of orders and the total market status disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
Air industry income decreased by 13 per cent to 2 billion USD.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said that the profits in this division increased almost by 11 per cent to 2.1 billion USD.
The incomplete transport contracts formed 32.6 billion by 30 September, compared to 31 December marginal growth.
The profit rate in the transport division has been affected by several major contracts.
The leaders stated that new views will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier, who also announced the arrival of Google Patrick Pichette's financial director, dropped during the trade on Thursday afternoon by 8.5 per cent per value of 4.83 USD.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest producer of commercial aircraft and the closest competitor of the Bombardier, announced a ten-percent decline in the quarterly profit.
A lawyer depending on cocaine that warned the mafian from the police investigation is in jail.
Basharat Ditta (42) was supposed to provide information to the king of the subworld Neil Scarbrough.
The attorney was afraid his drug addiction would come out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A sculptor who informed a drug mafian of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his drug addiction would appear was convicted to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had after he became a suspect of the use of cocaine, the chief of Neil Scarbrough's subworld was transferring sensitive information to Neil Scarbrough on the investigation of his drug trafficking activities.
The attorney whose name was "Bash" (parts) and who was celebrated as the best legal representative, was arrested at his home in 2011 after the Scarborough police survey in previous drug proceedings.
Policemen saw Sarborough (32), left him in a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just for dinner with his colleagues from the Legal Society, three bags of cocaine.
Based on the tests in which cocaine traces were found in his hair, on his wallet and its credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of class A.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he was trying to get the information on the arrest of two men for Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were monitored at that time in a large investigation of heroin trade and cocaine in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After the police held heroin and cocaine worth approximately 1,5 million GBP with 200 000 GBP in cash, 32 others ended in prison with them.
Ditta (42) provided information to criminals because of fear that his dependence on cocaine would come.
Today, Ditta, who worked with Forbes Solicitors with the Blackburn residence, experienced a shameful moment before the Liverpool Crown Court, when he was found guilty in two cases of defending justice.
During the previous hearing, he confessed to hold cocaine.
The fall of the lawyers came after the Scarborough police investigation found that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives were watching the suspect, recording his arrival to Ditt's house, and they saw him put a drug on the cleanness of 60 percent under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Then Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone interview.
The lawyer returned home where he found drugs, and nine interviews were held between both people.
In the court, the drug traces of class A were found in his hair, wallet and on its credit cards and that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine.
Ditta was arrested later, but he denyed the use of cocaine, and said that he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and argumented that their conversation falls into “confidential communication”.
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards from it, but they were all detained and his hair samples were taken away.
At the police interrogation, he said he was running his office both at his home addresses and at the workplace, and that his clients were visiting him at home for work.
However, the Court heard that after the key arrests, he contacted significant players in the drug supply chain, some of whom before represented to tell them what detectives know about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else knows that he must not violate the law than a legal representative in the criminal area. ”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of his position of a legal representative and of getting in too close contact with a specific client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were certainly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it's gone far beyond the border of the common relationship of a lawyer-client.
The police investigation dreamed as much as possible to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't bring his profession a good reputation, but he disrespected her.
He was too close to some of his clients, especially with Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be disrupted.
Ditta refused the offence and said: “If I was a corrupt lawyer whom I am not, and I would like to give the information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not expect 15 hours, but I would do it immediately. ”
However, after the hearing, the police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal from a legal representative in the criminal area himself at the time he began to gain drugs from organized criminals. ”
His dependence on cocaine has made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable against the purposes of the leading representatives of the organized crime groups that gave him as an assignment to collect valuable information on the police investigation.
Legal representatives must stick to the highest principles of integrity and have public confidence and feelings that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind his professional pants.
The unit for serious and organised crimes in Lancashire led against Mr. Ditt's investigation, on which he was also convicted in three cases of holding cocaine and now for preventing justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring the criminals to court.
This case should serve for all the criminals as a warning that no one is out of the reach of the law.
We'll find you and build you in front of our courts.
Sam Scarborough was convicted to 14 years of prison after he was declared guilty of combining to deliver heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
The next thirty-five persons involved in trade have been detained to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his Ditta web site, he arranged an online interview in which he said that his dream work would be legally representing clients from the death block in America, as a guest to dinner would wish Mohammed Ali, and as a motivation for work, he stated inequality.
He was negotiating the government with Klaus and Spidla.
Now the people of Jan Casal have sent them against Babish.
People have received 14 Members in the elections, i.e. just a third of the number of social democrats or representatives of ANO.
But at least they enter into government negotiations with one advantage.
In the team that has already argued the possibilities of the possible coalition, Jan Casal has a man who has the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006 as a human being.
Social democrats and Andrej Babish don't have such a matador on their own.
This will probably remind the first negotiation in 1992, when the ODS was also a whole new party.
"The experiences were minimal at that time," Kasal estimates how this year's interviews will develop.
Kenya Press Disturbed by Controversial Law on Media
"It is a scary report, and it is in place to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply disturbing the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspaper said considering the draft of the law as a constitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director-General of the Capital Group, which also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and the reporting websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be enshrined because it is a prolonged hand of the government" and that the restrictions on the content and advertising will harm Kenya's position in the world's economy.
"I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this proposal of the law and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star Law Proposal, it actually transmits to the government the "complete control of the media" and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "whispered a hard wound" and criticizes the draft law as "strict".
The approval of the draft law comes in the middle of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the Islamic Shooter attack in the Westgate Shopping Centre.
The anger of the offices, the Kenya media, was turned on when it sent a security camera recording that the soldiers were allegedly robbing a trade with luxury goods at the scene.
The police director responded by calling two journalists and the manager of the media worker to interrogate, but the call was later withdrawn after press pressure.
According to the new proposal of the law, media companies may be sentenced to up to 20 million Kenian shillings and individual journalists to one million along with the risk of “exclusion from the list” or may be denied by the official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the perpetrators if the penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “one penalty is enough to eliminate the majority of radio stations. ”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidation effect on what Kenya is called “live blogosphere”.
Politicians know that if the media shut up, they can do what they want.
"You never know what can happen," wrote journalist Nation Mutuma Mathiu and described the Kenya media as the key source of the system of mutual control and export in public life.
"When we leave it in politics, they will bring the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and collecting," he wrote.
The lawmakers in Kenya were the target of the public's criticism in the past.
In May, they voted for the cancellation of the cuts ordered by the national remuneration agency and for the renewal of their fat salaries of about 532,000 unsupplied shillings per month, which are thus allocated to the highest in the world.
It's got to go, young Czechs know.
Most of them don't even know what interests
Still more of the Czechs take money away.
Still, they are not reaching champions in the region.
The most money is being stored on the side of the Avengers, who persist in the average of 181 euros monthly.
More than Czech people in Slovakia.
This comes from an examination of the Erste Savings Barometr in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of arrivals is improved and two thirds of the questionnaires are planning to make a side of more money.
While the Czech Republic is nearly in the middle of a staircase, in Romania and Serbia, the people of distorting products are still very few.
For example, nearly every other Serb has been investigated by a study at home "beneath the pillow".
This year, the quantity of those who have a monthly higher amounts has increased.
Last month, thousands to 2,5,000 crowns were postponed by 26 percent of respondents, and this year it was five percent more.
The average monthly comparison but mildly dropped to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit between supplies is pension insurance.
This prefers 54 per cent of the Czech Republic, while three years ago it was the most favorite way to assess savings only for 36 per cent of people.
On the contrary, the familiarity of construction arrangements is declined, and, compared to last year, the interest in investment funds has also been significantly declined.
You've only been using 16 percent of the respondents, while it was almost a quarter of people last year.
The survey also showed that, although people consider it important to argue, most of them do not know what profits they make in individual products.
In particular, young people under 30 years do not know how much their money is paid.
On the contrary, the best awareness of the profitability of their stored money has the oldest group asked, 73 percent of people over 50 years of age know.
In the international comparison of the Erste Czech group, the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
These are the Slovaci and the Experienced with a 12 per cent distance.
UN celebrates the new goals of fighting poverty
The United Nations is starting to work immediately on a new aim file that will replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) which have been introduced 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Before the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which started at Rio de Janeiro over the night, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDG, which would expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of a document that will be approved by the world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
General Secretary of the United Nations Pan Ki-mun over the night at the summit said that it is now time to “to rise over national interests”.
"I am pleased that the Member States agreed to launch and take over the process to introduce the general objectives of sustainable development – SDG," he said.
The SDG will build progress achieved within the Millennium Development Goals and will be a part of the 2015 development programme.
I will make all my efforts to fill the mandate given to me by the Member States and implement our vision on the goals of sustainable development that are constructed to the success of the MDG.
Mosambik's security concerns are increasing due to the conflict of strong personalities
Under the Statue of Samary Machela, the Mozambique President of the founder, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputa to make peaceful passwords for rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, the executive director of the investment company.
With fear of the future of her country, she exchanged her business clothes for a shirt decorated by "we demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Square of Independence in the capital.
Two weeks later, nearly daily reports of conflicts between the government and the Renamo side were reported on one of the worst fights from the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once unfairly known rebel movement, originally supported by the white government in Rhodes and then by the government of apartheid in South Africa, in the framework of the efforts to destabilise the independent government of this country.
After the 1992 peace agreement, the opposition party became.
The analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that the country will rebuilt an open conflict, but the recent events have been shocked by foreign investors and local investors.
There is a rapidly growing economy, because the discovery of large coastal reserves of oil and coal in the northwest can bring more than $50 billion from companies, such as the Brazilian Rio Tinto and Vale, Italian Eni and American Anadarko.
The ruling party Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo are accused of the arrival of tension.
The Renamo argues that the government has caused the last conflict by launching a attack on their members in the Sofala Province, the traditional garden of the Renamo Party.
The violent attack of former rebels then elevated when the government forces attacked the Renamo party and tried to kill Afons Dhlakam, the leader of the group, said for the Financial Times speaker Renamo Fernando Mazanga.
The government accuses Renamo's conflicts because they said they attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza was trying to relieve his concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza for the French press office AFP said in the Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a “shoot ” who wanted to use“ whatever of his power remained to try to prove that he could order his own decisions to the government. ”
As Frelimo and Renamo claim that they want to avoid war.
However, the concerns increased when the words of Mr. Mazanga were quoted that the Renamo Party departed from the 1992 peace agreement.
The FT list said that he meant that the Party of Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations but with seriousness," Mr. Mazanga said.
The previous interviews between these parties have made a small number of fights this year to mitigate tensions between these parties.
It's a charvatt between the two large personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), a teacher at the Open University and a expert at Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to make necessary resignations.
The Renamo Party, which has been trying to change the elections, has already expressed that it would boycott communal elections planned for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort to commerce with the government to obtain benefits and financial expenses.
The election share of Renamo has been reduced since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by the former member of the Renamo, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza, who is ending the second functioning period next year, wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"He doesn't want a democratic system of more parties, he doesn't want transparency elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to release the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what the Renamo Party has, but he has committed disturbing terrorist attacks on police stations and on vehicles on the key road between north and south.
Most of the fights occurred in the Sofala province, which is a few hundred miles away from the capital of Maputo, but where the town of Beira, the port on which mine companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, are based on their exports of carbon.
In June, Rio stopped for about a week of use of the railway when the Renamo party threatened to attack this line.
Mr. Mazanga didn't want to say whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted “to warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many are also concerned about corruption, slow development rates and recent abduction swimming.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is exclusively the government and the president and that he should be the one who finds solutions to problems," he says.
The demonstrator Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"No one cares about either Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, want free access to roads," he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life, ” says the author.
The stories of Thor can show that “the grave power cannot be compared to smart falseness, ” while the Artush legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of myths would “be too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene”, said Crossley-Holland, who is committed to a careful selection of works to the age.
"I think it is great that myths and human creation are already part of education," he said.
I've been on this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly teaching ” authors and teachers are in the visual story with a“ threshold ” message for children as “exclusive. ”
Crossley-Holland, who translated the Epos Beowulf from English and who also writes Norway Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Buchores, says: “You can have good intentions, but you will do better if you keep them for yourself.”
Probably the greatest difference between the adult author writing for adults and an adult writer who writes for children is a sense of hope.
It is not possible that everything must be simplified or ended with a happy end, but there must be a natural sense for good and evil.
And it must be underconscious; revealed through the story, not openly determined.
The truth is, it's better to show than to describe.
The Brnen Starhouse will take visitors to the universe in a new digitalary
At first, it's obvious that the big planetary room has changed in the last six months.
There is a new scene, visitors can fall into new comfortable seats and over their heads a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of the dome from the US Spitz company.
In the middle of the hall is his most important part, a new projector from Japan.
In order to be perfect, there are other smaller projectors in the hall.
Another important part of the whole device is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the chief of the Brown Star Store, Jiří Dušek.
The computers will ensure that the image of several projectors is not covered, but that it gives a complete impression.
"The computer wink is thirty-five times higher than in classical personal computers," the Technology from the star store Tomasz Gladík.
The digitary can explode extremely realistic and plastic models of night sky, human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The divers are egging right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Other similar devices are closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The head of the starhouse plans to project purchased series and its own creation in the hall.
There are two series on the program since Saturday.
The first name is Astronaut and is intended for adults.
People will learn about the training of cosmonauts, flying to the universe, turning on the centerrifice, and then in the respective examples, they will see the difficult conditions of astronauts faced in space.
The second show is for children and is named The Magic Mountain - Kaluoka'hina.
He tells a story of the cliff whose pestro colored inhabitants lived a quiet life until the explosion of a nearby vulture.
The whole Digitarium cost approximately 50 million crowns paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
Minor amounts also contributed to the city Brno and the starhouse from its budget.
The project area cost ten million crowns, projector of twelve million.
"The rest has swallowed audiovisual techniques and computers," Dušek explained.
The digital installation followed the restructuring of the entire building that the starhouse passed two years ago.
According to director Duška, 25 to 30 thousand visitors could come by the end of the year.
We've studied 11,000 INZERATES!
We know where they want you to go to work!
In November last year, the analysis took over 11,000 remarks offering workplace, of which 4300 were published in daily press and 6800 ads (62 percent) online.
Thus, the Internet becomes the most important media for publicizing job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was carried out for the first time, its share was 26 per cent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), he was at approximately 60 per cent.
The insurance of working opportunities in itself according to the analysis reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example can be a simple comparison of the number of public advertisings during the period of economic prosperity and during the economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, nearly 25,900 advertising were published, which was less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented to a higher, especially a more qualified group of professions.
On the contrary, a daily job offer covers a broader spectrum of professions, including those workshops, said Paulina Happy author.
The rate of representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, the front places of the advertising searches for managers and managers, business representatives, programmers and financial experts were taken.
The position of the programmers or the managers of small enterprises was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, but the large representation belongs in particular to service and workshops.
Of course, the most frequent requirements that employers express by means of an advertising offer include education.
The other spectacular areas included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the request for knowledge of foreign language was set out in three percent of the advertising, on the Internet in 37 per cent.
Only two per cent of the advertisements employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
The claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 per cent of the advertising (in daily press in 11 per cent, online in 57 per cent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of the advertising.
Practice requirements are connected to qualified professions.
In particular, it is about manufacturing and other managers.
In particular, working professions include mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and food manufacturers or electrical equipment repairers, the author of the study of Jiří Tillner complemented.
The employees shall also indicate in the middle of their advertising requirements for the qualities and skills of possible applicants.
As the most frequently required skills, in the first place, communication skills have been shown for a long time.
Employers further require flexibility, adaptability and dynamic, self-dependence, responsibility, organizational capacities and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be claimed that the city of New York was the place where the solo comic show was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, a variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as chairman of the theatre at the theatre of the Theatre in Broadway, began to talk jokes to the people.
Fay's innovation has expanded over years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The Festival founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Institute of Solid Comedy Carolines, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – together with more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theatres.
"The majority of these titles appeared in Carolines and became successful to the extent that they were too large to play in the club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the show of Wandy Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the "Stand Up for Heroes" (stand up for heroes), the annual musically-comedial beneficial show in Madison Square Garden, where others will show Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As this festival expanded, the world of comedies has spread.
Several comics attended this year's festival came from non-traditional channels such as show in smaller radio and television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll screwed up with his sitcom (the picant "League" to the fantastic football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show at Comedy Central Station.
Jenny Slate was a member of the program “Saturday night alive” and “Parks and recreation”, but the most celebrated by the rapidly spreading series of videos “Marcel the shell with shoes on” (musle Marcel in shoes).
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comics with clearly recognized voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, rigid, racially targeted W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest enthusiasts of the festival will be a conversation: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a solo comic, but he became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comic historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he held a TV show called “Sit down comedy with David Steinberg”.
The meeting is held in the Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedial DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he's walking a street between two buildings and he's thinking, "Oh, man, if I lose all my money, I might live here."
Oil price further falls to $96 for a barrel
The price of oil on Friday continued to decline, as concerns about high supplies exported by the report showing the strengthening of the Chinese energy hunger sector.
The American oil indicator for December's delivery during the late morning fell in European electronic trade at the New York Trade Bureau by 14 cents per $96.24 per barrel.
On Thursday, the decline was 39 cents, and for the month of October, he remained by 5.8 per cent.
The rich supply of oil in the past weeks burdened the price.
The Ministry of Energy stated in the Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels.
In five weeks, the supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, two Chinese production reports showed greater demand.
This suggests that the economic recovery of China would continue to be strengthened after the growth that, after the previous two weak decades, at 7.8 per cent in the third quarter.
Ropa Brent, an international oil indicator also used by American raphineries, fell on the International Trade Bureau in London by 26 cents per $108.58 per barrel.
Not that, Mr. Hask.
We have a unique opportunity to tell the politicians that it's not like this.
It is necessary to develop such pressure that Martin Hašek will be rid of all political functions and leave the messenger's mandate.
Any other solutions will reduce the level of political culture that is already so miserable.
Martin Hašek is protected by the promise he has made, but everyone and politics must be particularly aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that politics has (Mr. Babish has also the material, but it is a question of whether it is politics).
The better program that the liar has promoted is untrusted.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he's reluctant in politics.
Mr. Hask, if you're saying that well with this country (and your frequent statements make me strong in this, so if you weren't lying - here you see how complex it is with lying), you'll leave the politics alone, as a man.
Then people will accept your apology as an expression of a man who has made a mistake and is responsible for her.
Otherwise, you will be viewed as weaknesses without spite, whose words or acts cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be proud, being a missing man, or a sketch for life.
It may seem unfair to you when I speak only to you, but you are the leader and they're just the wrong sheep.
And you're the leader and you've always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to put your ears together for a moment, overtake powers, get out of shame, and then attack again, but that's how the partyists are acting.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes, the leader, the alpha male, so behave.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
The Court blocked regulations concerning the stop and search of persons by the police department in NY
On Thursday, the Federal Court of Appeal blocked the judicial Regulation requesting changes in the stop and search of persons at the police department in New York and dismissed the judge of the case.
The other American appeals, the Federal Court said that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be delayed until the appeal made by the city.
Judge decided in August that the city violated the Constitution by carrying out its programme of stoping and querying people.
The city of its conclusion and its correction Regulation have been considered, including the decision to allocate supervision to the police department, which would help to change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
The Court heard the appeal in Tuesday for the requested delay.
The Court of Justice said that the judge must be revoked from the case because she had encountered a conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by not acting as a judge in accordance with the requirement of avoiding the appearance of an undertaking, partly due to a series of interviews with the media and the public statement, which she openly responded to the court's criticism.
The Judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of thousands of people when they wrongly focused on black people and Spanish within their stop and search programme.
It set an independent surveillance to monitor the major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and supervision, and orders the launch of a pilot programme to test the bodies' cameras in certain areas where there is a most common stop.
In August, the city of New York agreed to terminate the method of storage of names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after the police search.
The oral reasons for the revocation of the city are sometimes planned after 14 March 2014.
Tactics to stop and search persons criticised a number of civil rights defenders.
There are some forms of stoping and searching for persons for some decades, but the recorded examinations under the management of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg dramatically increased to the record number of 684 330 in 2011, in most cases it was black and Spanish.
In 2004, four men who belonged to the minority, the complaint that became a case of a group of lawsuits.
The representatives of the NY police department's programme's changes in the cessation and search programmes argue that changes will end unfair practices, increase confidence and efficiency of the police community and may affect how these procedures apply to other police departments.
The opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morality, but not crime, and that money is smuggling, but it will not solve a broader problem when the police congregation is under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by thousands of people in the last decade.
The judge noted that she had not completed the practice of stoping and searching for persons who are constitutional but reformed the way the police department was conducted in the NY.
Five Shopping Centres are facing low visits
This comes from the data of Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle's real estate advisory company.
In Prague Bohenics, the public opens the Krakov Trade Centre, will be the 19th Prague Shopping Center.
There are now a total of 90 large business centres in the Czech Republic.
The unsatisfactory performance approximately 20 percent of the middle and large centres.
The main problems are insufficiently large centres against locality and bad layouts, that is too many floors or complicated and inconvenient passage arrangements, wherever dead centres," Michal Sotak said from Cushman & Wakefield.
According to Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, the headquarters of retail real estate also face a low visit to about five business centres.
Among the main reasons include mixed traffic availability, low income category of local inhabitants or the sustainability of the market in the given place.
Some projects were opening almost fully busy, but their results were primarily unsatisfactory at first.
Today customers are a little conservative and unwantedly changing their shopping habits.
The new business centre must try more to "take" its customers into new marketmarks, entertainment, services and marketing activities," Samadi added.
Storage centres are generally stable, even in some centres, because the rentals were willing to discount from rental and rent some units.
"But it is true that some projects that are not fully busy and the average employment have recently been opened (e.g. Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Chantovka in Olomouca)," Sotak added.
Trade centres opened in the past two years are promoting very slowly on the market according to Sylvia Samadi.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of seats suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague, we see space for building a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly a place for smaller local projects, so-called "convinience centres", aimed at shopping and services of daily needs for the population living in the immediate area," Samadi said.
According to Sotak, there is also a place for other shopping centres in the country market.
And it's both for small 'servicing' centres, for big projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or enlargement in regional cities.
"The places such as Kladno, Czech Buddejovice, Brno or Plyzen have space for further growth," Sotak added.
In Prague, they see space for the prepared business center on the Victory Square, and according to it, they have a clear potential of the street on the Pricope and the Václava Square.
"Intensively the expansion of retail parks that allow traders to cover and expanse to increasingly small towns for favourable rental and operational costs, the area is also in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centres, respect for their reconstruction such as the restructuring of business houses Prior, which comes from a good place," Dita Kubankov from DTZ added.
In Czech Republic, 90 modern shopping centres are currently located with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross rental area.
The quarter of all these shopping centres is located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of rentals, nine of them are in Prague, is based on Incoma GfK data.
In the number of shopping parks, the PRC is under the EU average, compared to the values of Britain and France, Czech Republic remains about 50 square meters per thousands of inhabitants.
Coulson broke into the phone to check the tip.
The former editor of newspaper News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson reportedly used the methods “cracking into the phone, watching and confronting” to confirm the fraud on the love relationship that the Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke, was involved in.
The state representative Andrew Edis at Old Bailey Court said that the News of the World had been caught in May 2005 by false news that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The papers authorized a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, to break into Pawlby's voicebox and invade in her privacy, but it sounded in court that Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"A national representative suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not a person standing in front of the house and hoping to catch people outside, but a man who likes to surrender stories to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways of studying stories: breaking into the phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in a third method.
Apparently he knows about the other one, watching, he needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone breaking?
He says no, we say, “But sure he knows. ”
The facts about the love relationship in which Clarke was involved were first captured by the NotW reporting department, when the source of sexual interest for Mrs. Paulby was said: “You're only wasting your time with Charles.”
The record with voice messages taken from her phone at least three occasions was obtained in Mulcair's house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of a private investigator where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were called "Projects".
During the time Mrs. Pawlby was investigated, her grandparents received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about Paulby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, the former rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup observed the monitoring of Mrs. Pawlby's movement.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005: “I got a story that we are going to give tomorrow and I would like to talk about with Charles. ”
Mr. Edis says that the involvement of Coulson in the story was according to the same model as other important personalities, including the former Minister of Interior David Blunkett.
The court said on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett for a loving relationship with a married woman, while he himself was seeing a cooperating Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied association with other persons in order to break into phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to break into the phone.
Discovery of NSA increases the social paranoia of monitoring by the State
One peaceful day at the end of August, the German police helicopter ran over the US Consulary Office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
In order of the Social Office for Constitutional Protection (BfV), the German Home Rapporteur Agency, the mission was intended to acquire photos of the US roof of the pre-filled patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claims that the BfV Authority hoped that it would be able to identify the presence of interrogation antennas, and this action started exchange of views between the US and the German Minister of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Rapporteur, again in September insisted that the United States did not use their foreign reporting opportunities, “to steal trade secrets from foreign companies for American companies and thus strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who became a collaborator, began to reveal his valuable collection from the secret monitoring of the United States, the European government and the front businesses, they don't know if the director's words should be trusted.
Following the reports that the US National Security Agency has conducted a spy in the Brazilian oil company and has obtained access to data with which the American cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have achieved a general paranoia on the public monitoring of new dimensions.
The last drop came to discover that the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel may have been listened for ten years.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, they are certainly the potential targets and the front entrepreneurs.
Snowden has reviewed intense cooperation between US rapporteurs and companies.
I would say it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefits.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, representing small and medium IT companies in Germany.
According to an examination issued in July by the EY Advisory Service, the German companies are convinced that in terms of industrial spying and stealing data, the United States is now the same risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in the entire documentation revealed by Mr Snowden that the United States has transmitted trade secrets to foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians expressed concerns that the EU lacks certain skills in the field of IT and the Internet and pointed out that it should try to limit its dependence on the United States:
The front businessmen are skeptical about this.
The German Parliament calls on votes that we should make a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
This is not a way, says Hasso Plattner, President of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn't have died 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidiary, from car to car and farmer.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scope and technical development of American spy agents discovered by Snowden is for some companies who have so far felt that the largest threat of monitoring is China, yet shocking.
There is a big turnover in cloud calculation techniques where European officials realized that data stored in the United States fall under the jurisdiction of the United States, which is why they are potentially attacking.
According to a survey carried out by the Commercial Community, Cloud security alliance approximately 10% of non-American members following the discovery of the U.S. Prism data do not use the cloud supplier in the United States.
Jim Snabe, one of the Director-General of SAP, says: “We have a new question for customers that has not been here a year ago - where are my data stored and you can guarantee that in this jurisdiction they will remain physically?”
Many German high factors argue that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew: that the powerful States want to dissect their most valuable secrets and these data must be protected at any price.
That economic spying is not a surprise.
It always happened.
"It is a substantial topic for many years and it has not changed significantly even during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Director-General of the Agrochemic company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, as we are doing a spy on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
The underministers generally do not want to commend themselves with anti-organisms that they have made so that they may not provide the assaulter's advantage.
In the case of large companies, it is long reminded that you take a free USB disk or leave an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the car office Audi, says that for many years it is common practice to collect prior to the meeting of the mobile phones, so that it cannot be used as a hearing device.
The German Office of BfV advises the managers to consider whether to use simplely pre-paid mobile phones on foreign roads because of the risk that smart phones can be failed.
Pre-paid mobile phones will then be dropped off.
However, there is concern that small and medium enterprises will continue to be hacking and monitoring vulnerable.
In Germany, many of these companies in their specific areas are the leading representatives of the global market.
“Minor and medium enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised approach”, warns BfV report.
The United States warns its own company from economic spying from other countries.
According to Washington Post, National Intelligence Estimate documents reported France in February next to Russia and Israel in the second series of perpetrators who are involved in the hacker activities for economic reporters, right behind China.
The German unrisk company member concluded that economic spying is “the worst of the French”.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Internal Rapporteur Agency of DCRI, said this month in one of the interviews: “The services know very well that all countries, even though they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies. ”
The parents of a juvenile boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe that he was murdered.
The parents of a teenager boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a scary fighting spirit in his high school gym, believes that their son was murdered, the family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from the city of Valdo in Georgia on 11 January was found declined in a spiritually equipped tribunal in the gym school where he was going.
Sheriff's investigators from the Lawdes County County concluded that Johnson died accidentally, but the family of a 17-year-old young man refuses it.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered," said for FoxNews.com attorney Benjamin Crump, who represented Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson.
They never believed that he died as sheriff said.
"They are convinced that it resists logic, physical laws and healthy reason," Crump said.
They believe that it should be soaked what really happened to protect a person responsible for their son’s death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school, and he returned to them in a bag of corpses," he said.
Deputy Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a regular investigation of Johnson's death, and noted that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
announced Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll be watching the facts, whatever they're going to take me anywhere.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for the regular investigation," he said.
Moore informed the journalists that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of “local choke. ”
However, the second autopsy according to Moore indicated another cause of death.
"There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if in the case of Johnson's death, there is enough evidence for a warrant to investigate the crime or violation of civil rights, the FBI will request and its implementation.
The Deputy Sheriff Office of the Lowndes District was not available for any comment on Thursday.
Judge from South Georgia in the middle ordered the authorities to provide all the videos from the tracking cameras that the investigators examined.
Adolescent parents hope that the video records will contain a lead to revealing how their son died.
The CDC Centre issued a directive for schools on allergies in children
In the centre of the Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases (CDC) issued a set of directives to assist in children's food allergy in school.
This is the first set of directives that the U.S. government has issued, because the number of children of school ages suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States is allergic to food.
The CDC Centre found that food allergy increased between 1997 and 2007 by 18 per cent.
The directives contain information for schools about how the teachers and staff should be informed of children's food allergies and how to react to allergic reactions if they occur.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline – most often used EpiPen’s automatic injector – be able to respond to potentially dangerous hypersensitivity.
National legislative authorities have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in conversations with children with allergic reactions.
The child may say, “It is like someone fucking my tongue, ”“ I feel like I have hair in my tongue ” or “I have a tongue. ”
Intersexual parents can choose “indefinite sex ”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize the third sex in children born with indifferent sex.
The newborn children will no longer be classified to either male or female sex.
The new law does not require any gender for such children, and it allows them to mention sex as “indetermined ” or“ unspecified. ”
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to quickly decide for surgery in order to designate sex, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersexual.
A intersexual person according to the BBC, after many years, said: “I am neither man nor woman. ”
I'm gonna stay a salad made by a doctor, beaten and scratched.
It is estimated that every year, one of 2,000 children is born, which is not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, covering the term for those with atypical chromosoms, genetic irons (eggles or warlates) or unusually developed genitalities.
Intersexual might have been Wallis Simpson.
Sex-determination is not fully understood yet, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be defined, it is better to use the best available information and to determine them, instead of waiting and watching the child’s psychological and physical development until the operation is carried out, if any.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determination problems, said that the new German law “seems like a good thing. ”
Intersexual children represent ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but it is not in most children," he said.
Gender specification can be performed without surgery and then can wait for the development of identity.
Knowledge of how sexuality develops in a child is not too accurate.
No one can answer the question why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are homosexuals.
The report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexual persons as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not sexually bound but on their biological building, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically composed of both and cannot be clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics may be shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growing, garments and characteristics, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual structures, or in the structure of chromosoms and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of discrimination experienced by intersexual and transsexual people in the work area, as well as levels of burden, violence and prejudice.
Guys who don't match any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowed to mark men, women, or “third sex ” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognised "unsexual" in June, when she won a judicial appeal so that she could keep the status of "indetermined" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, German passports, except M (man) and F (woman) and third mark, X, for intersexual persons.
In neighbouring France, a report on France 24 is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this strongly Catholic country signed the petition for the elimination of “the theory of sex from schoolbooks”.
The American Catholic websites online also defined the German law and wrote: “When the world is drawn to a new state where sex is a matter of choice but not sexual activity, we turn two other pillars of civilization. ”
One newborn mother from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would prefer to see the child’s gender at birth.
“Parenthood itself is stressful without any other restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she said for the web sites relating to parental care.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermafrodites, according to a beautiful Greek who had a double sex.
And about ten years back, the medical community believed that sex was something like a table that could be deleted and remained.
But now many challenge the ethical basis of the operation by having sexuality complex and sometimes doctors can decide wrong because they don't know how children will feel when they grow up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these kids were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist but a surgeon.
The continuing theory of how to deal with children with inexplicit sex was presented by Dr. John Money at the University of Johns Hopkins, who had a view that sex was subject.
He created a new term “sexuality” and argumented that social causes and influences of the environment — as parents raised their child — affected children’s genes and hormones and created a child, regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as “John/Joan”, his theory became disputed.
He recommended the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged because of the wrong circumcision, that their child would be completely castrated, removed his warlates and raised as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful conversion case, but the fact was different," Drescher said.
When he was 15 years old, he went back to the boy and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some physicians “used this model” today.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared to be “conscious with the result. ”
It was also a case of Jim Bruce, a 36 - year - old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosoms, but inexplicit sexual arrangements.
The doctors were not sure if he had a big clit, or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man, he could never live “the satisfactory life. ”
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from outside authorities and warlates and was raised as a girl.
When he was 12 years old, he got women's hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said for ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At 18, he was sent to the wax plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
After I was born, I was sterilized and nobody ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with gender disorders (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone so that its sexual structure could be properly developed.
After he learned the truth, he changed back to men, took the doses of testosterone and had to remove his coats,
Operations caused his inferiority.
Today he represents other in the organization called Interface Project and is trying to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the Advocates Advocates for informed choices with the headquarters in California, is afraid that the German law is “urged to cement and stigmats”.
“Most activists are afraid that the German law will achieve the encouragement of parents to make rapid decisions and choose “indefinite” for the child,” she said.
We're afraid that's what encourages intervention.
We think it's better to allocate male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law eventually sounds, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "he allows adults to choose to be included in third sex".
"The adults should be able to make their own own decision on legally applicable sex," she said.
The German law is about to allocate it at its birth.
That's a battle that a little child should not seduce at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a pillar from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law will "contribute" both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosoms, but DSD has a syndrome of insensitiveness to androgens.
Because her androgenic receptors are defective, Katie's female characteristics developed.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have an uterus and eggs.
Now, 29 - year - old Katie is married, and she works as a trainer in child psychiatry in Pennsylvania in the course of the university study.
Although she is inferior, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or replacement motherhood.
"The law will give parents some space to avoid rushing their decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to perform some tests and think about it and gives them time before they write “husband ” or“ wife. ”
In this regard, everything is fine — you raise your child and love him.
You've got a wonderful baby and you're happy about it.
You don't have to rush with an operation that's inadequate.
"It brings the opportunity to include both the child's decisions and takes away the concerns that parents bond because they are uncertain that they do the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child decides what sex he is more identical — and that is a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk poured the whole house with gasoline: He threatened to burn it with his own family!
The tension rose, the fear was scaled.
The man started threatening the whole house to burn.
Instead, all the available police patrols in the area, as well as the firefighters from Young Boleslavia and the unit of the congregation of voluntary firefighters.
There was a police negotiator who tried to talk to his irrational behaviour.
The man still threatened the house to burn.
So there must have been an intrusion force that disposed of the man and tied him into the house.
Then the aggressor ended up for a study in the Youth of the Hospital, from where he was transferred to the anti-alcohol station.
Finally, the firefighter's house was filled with gasoline sorbent that they later cleaned up.
In addition, all domestic animals were saved from the house except for persons.
The police negotiator didn't give a man to the police negotiator, so the command came after him.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to exchange Biden for Hillary Clinton
The nearest advisor of President Barack Obama, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering to replace the candidate of 2012 Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton.
This discovery is the most important sensation expected books on the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann “Double down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the coming book and announced on Thursday night that the president's top collaborators organized intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether removal of Biden would help to restore Obama's bleeding hope of re-election.
According to a national-politic writer for the magazine Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of the leaders within the campaign and in the White House, namely the former Chief of the White House of Bill Daley, to measure the effect on the elections of the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Clinton to the post of the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly preserved secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and within the Oval Labour.
Only a few president's closest advisors -- including Daley, former head of Obam's campaign Jim Messina and former major advisors in the White House of David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew that this change was considered.
The book "Double Down" claims that Daley was an representative of the attempt to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to take this move when the data showed that the Clinton add to the candidate would "Obam's chances would not significantly increase".
In his interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering the replacement of Biden Clinton.
"I was intensely exploring a number of things, and this was one of them," Daley said for the paper.
Don't forget that the president had a terrible chance at that time, so we said, "Jesus, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley has characterized research as “suitable care”, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-elected campaign had made a lot of investment to determine whether this move was worth the elections.
"In campaigns, such money is not made available for elections and quality research, unless something is seriously considered," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told the CNN that Daley asked if his boss knew about this potential card mix.
While Daley said that he didn't think that the president had been aware of the potential changes, the former head of the office admitted that it was "possibly" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" definitely does not answer the question whether the political probe came to Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research on the exclusion of Biden from the candidate.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British entrepreneur made the first ice cream that shines in the dark - using the meduza.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent qualities of this seafish animal and developed a lightening pample.
He came to the idea when he read the professional medusion debate, and convinced the scientist in China to make chemical protein that causes lighting.
This ice cream reacts with consumer language – increases pH levels in protein and then causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream lights when he reacts with the warm mouth, so the more you lick, the clearer it is.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (lick me, I taste great), says: "It's an amazing substance, but we're at the beginning, so in 200 GBP you'll get about 2 g of this substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue in neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms the protein, the pH level is rising and the ice cream starts to shine.
We tested it over the past few months and it seems to be a great idea for Halloween's celebration, because it causes this fantastic bright effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the lighting of the meduse is four times more expensive than the gold.
And that's how every clip cost me about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie's experimental company in Bristol is known for his untraditional taste of beer, cheese, beef and gold tickets.
But his next product should be even more ambitious.
He says: “I would really like to make an invisible ice cream.”
In fact, it's impossible because of the fracture of the light caused by ice crystal that makes ice, but I'm counting on some way to do it, we'll find it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the meduse artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay awake long and show us with our neighbors in a dress.
Today I feel like I'm a custody.
Two years later, the sugar showed up in my apartment, and it probably won't be different this year.
However, statistics show that I'm black sheep, as to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF) this year, Halloween will celebrate most Americans – in fact 158 million of them – and will spend a total of $6.9 billion for sweets, costumes and decorations.
But every time I look forward to Halloween, there are trends.
According to NRF, $6.9 billion is expected to be 1.2 billion per costumes.
This year, the last shot of fashion is sexy inlive objects.
Sexy must not be only women anymore; sexy can also be like pizza, hamburger and corn.
With regard to men, I expect we'll see a lot of zombies through the passage of the dead, and I'll bet that spacemen from Daft Punk will bring it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most searchable zombie suits, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes, and to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
In fact, the Americans according to NRF will spend this year $330 million for animal love costumes.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
As for sweets, we're not wasting time.
According to Nelsen, the Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
It's approximately 300 million pounds of Hershey tables, lipstick, sweets Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark sticks.
This is an amazing report for 41 million Christmas people who are going to attack our quarters according to the U.S. Trade Ministry.
In fact, we'll buy during Halloween, and believe not and consume, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Sugars around Halloween, they will be sold nearly 16,000 tonnes.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
That's a secret I've never discovered.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than scary houses.
They have the best names, such as "The Terror behind the walls" (Hroza behind walls, which is, by the way, a real prison) "Howl-O-Scream" (eco, wreak) and "The house of shock" (The Shock House).
In fact, there are officially dedicated 1200 scary homes in the United States that, according to the American Scary Houses, profits of $500 million, including those amazing photos that you're wearing fears, and you can't remove them, and the person you like, take a look at the photo and write a comment like "to face nice".
And eventually, there's something a little bit about the bowls.
Since we were little, Charlie Brown presented us a big pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and the cutting of pumpkin fever is something like a decoration of Christmas tree – we've been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the trend of “child in the chicken ” started with the Pinterest application only last year, so most of us grew up on cutting the tickle instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Counting Office, the Americans will spend approximately 106 million dollars in the dust.
Flashlight with a flamming flame on your front veranda is probably originating in Illinois, where this year it grew 245,000 tonnes of dye.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Matisdon from Napa city in California and try to cut their pumps weighing almost one tonne.
Notified series of race land Rovers
The interior has racing seats and six-point security belts, as well as intercommunications devices.
The selection has improved brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between individual races.
Drew Bowler, Technical Director Bowler Motorsport, said: “The racing players that come to Bowler have changed. ”
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure, as well as a gainable path to world-class races.
We are glad that we can offer this trip in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience various race disciplines in Britain and invasion, and that it will prepare the competitor for the hardship and reality of the Rally Raid races.
The development of the Defender Challenge car we really enjoyed – it will be a really exciting competition.
Furthermore, Defender Challenge offers a school and test day in February, as well as an opportunity to compete in eastern races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: In two years, we have early elections here
ToP President 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects further early elections.
A week after the last interview for Current.cz said there is no other exit and every government risen from the voting last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg with the fact that the lifetime of the beginning election period is estimated within two years.
With objection that the voters are barely choosing the other time, they don't agree, "I think it will be a little more balanced decision."
At the same time, the President 09 does not accept that his party could still lose voters in other elections as this year (as opposed to 2010, it lost approximately 300 000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear in two months that early elections will be, it will strengthen the movement ANO 2011 of Andrea Babiša.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babish will lose.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where the President of Godslav Sobotka, after the secret last meeting of the part of the leadership of the party, declared that he or Michal Hašek will remain in the leadership of social democracy, commented Schwarzenberg after his own:
"The leaders of the Democratic Party as small boys go behind the head of the state to allow them to turn into a country."
"I thought Mr. Hashek was more intelligent and more intelligent."
"Because I haven't seen something so unexpectedly badly done in my life," President TOP 09 added.
And in the direction of President Zeman (with whom he encountered in the fight for the presidential function) he crushed: "The role of the head of the state is clear: He wants to make it possible."
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the elections for you personally?
TOP 09 has formally submitted its first proposals for laws in the House, including the Pharmaceutical Register of Contracts, which before the elections were discussed by the Conference Committees, but had fallen under the table with early elections.
The President 09 in the Interview for Current.cz claims that such speed is given by "these laws are needed".
At the same time, TOP 09 clearly wants to prevent similar attempts from other sides.
For example, the leader of the electoral movement ANO Martin Komarek accused TOP 09 in the pre-electoral struggle for the idea of introducing a registry of contracts "fting" the ANO Movement Programme.
TOP 09 has now used a leverage -- just embarrassed the proposal that had been made up to the second House reading.
The fire units came to save the lost puppies that stuck 15 meters above the country on a dangerous stone in the stone.
The cocrosphanian Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, the man who was captured in a stonewall saw him wiped the dog.
The firemen were scattering on the rock wall to save the dog from a certain death.
The puppy was released by fire units who came to release him after he was in some way captured on a dangerous barrel in a stonebreaking 15 meters above the earth.
The nine-month cocrosspanger Ruby fled after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and three days he survived himself until he was released from the stone.
His owners Scott Alderson (25) and their girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in a stone of Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet again with Ruby and thank them for the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he fled when he got into a small accident, they hotly searched for their lost dog and set challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday at 14.15, a clever peasant peasant Ruby was seen in a stonewall 15 meters above the earth.
Instead, a technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station has hurried down to release Ruby, using a carriage bag for animals after the rock.
The expert commander of Andy Clayton's Technical Rescue Team said, "The dog was in a dangerous situation.
He was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and below.
He didn't move his eyebrows at the rescue; he was totally frozen.
But now it's okay.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual exit.
The fact that someone saw a dog is incredible.
The expert chief of the Technical Rescue Team Peter Lau said: “Rubs had great happiness during his escape. ”
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian on a search, and except for exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Ms. Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was afraid when I saw a rescue action. ”
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to keep him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
Firemen did a great job.
What they did was very courageous.
We're very grateful to them, they were just awesome.
Mr. Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid he could fall, but he stayed there. ”
The firemen were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that after that 18-year-old Katy Perry definitely didn't leave.
During an interview for the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that for Jagger's song “Old habits die hard” in 2004 sang accompanying vocals.
Perry said when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
And she added: “That was a long time ago, and now he is very kind to me. ”
In a statement from Thursday Jagger's (70) representative said that he categorically refused to make Katy Perry proposals.
The deputy said, “He may be mixing him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the hosting singers (singers) who showed up on the Rolling Stones concert this year.
Her new "Prism" album debuted this week first.
George Kerevan: Split Europe gives Scots a choice
Next day, another scary story of independence.
This time, a warning appears that the condition for membership of independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry to Schengen.
This has caused stories of passport checks in Berwick and the barked wire along the Hadrian vale.
It is true that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned possible economic advantages of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as it was expected, the titles of the papers have not been produced.
No one also mentioned that the EU Member States spend time adapting their official laws if it suits them.
Since Scotland is not in Schengen now, the continuing disagreement offer would be a cheap reimbursement to Brussels for anything they really want from the Scotts.
So it's a pretty weak story.
Furthermore, he was so old that he became a digging rack, a reporting duck that “independence means passport controls, ” I heard at least 40 years ago.
Still, there is an interesting idea in this beard story.
Why should it be expected that independent Scotland will listen to Europe?
Why trade London's chumout for the Brusselsian, especially now?
This is a real European story: a great war plan to unify Europe has finally broken down.
The euro crisis influences the so-called Europe Project is officially dead.
Throughout Europe the impact of the dedicated resistance to the EU or the cancellation of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party Alternate for Germany – founded in this year – came out of nowhere and has already taken advantage of nearly five million votes in September’s votes, which is essentially "free Democrats" from Bundestag (equivalent of British Liberal Democrats).
There was always a resistance to the plan to create federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a crucial moment.
The savings dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank together with the collaboration of the national economies, through emphasis on common currency, have led many people to think that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has only little to do with the fact that national governments have a high budget deficit – that was true only in Greece.
It is more about the euro system that blocks its members on exchange rates of advantage for German exporters – and German politicians want to keep it.
Without the possibility of devaluation of domestic currency, Southern Europe in the field of domestic production, compared to Germany, is inadequate.
The only help is to scratch revenues and public expenses — which Germany encourages.
The current budget and currency problems are a deeper cause of European malate performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – the French and German companies' support code for consumer costs – the European industry is twice as much as electricity and four times more gasoline than it is in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in the cost area, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even all the freezing of salaries in the world would not disturb the screwing of the European petrochemical industry with cheap oil from the United States.
The result is the rebellious rebellion, especially in France, once excited EU advocacy.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that Germany will hold on the stand and allow Paris to stand in the world at Washington level.
Berlin, however, does not need political legitimacy as a license for Paris and has put its own economic policy in Europe and the needed French economy on its destiny.
Result: The true wing of Marine Le Pena, the anti-European National Front, has just won essential additional elections and has moved ruling socialists to the third place.
The Fronta is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for British labourists that they cannot assume that the right curve will automatically be positive on the left.
How does Le Penn load with its new acquired popularity between the white working class?
The European elections in the next year would like to take advantage of creating an anti-European block against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a block can dominate the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
I am thinking that, in a visual period, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will be connected and the euro will be destroyed.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more free in the sense of “Europe (suvereign) peoples”, General de Gaulle has already preferred.
Germany and several its satellite economies may have the euro, but France and Southern Europe will renew their own currencies.
I expect Great Britain to be distanced from this project and joined the United States.
However, the increased interest of Washington in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be a region (in principle) Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – the possibility of notifying Berlin and Brussels when they should leave us.
I assume that Scotland would have done well in the relaxed arrangement of Europe, provided that it would preserve its own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly contemplating countries would be easier in non-federal Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and keep our economic independence.
The government of SNP in Scotland is – amazing – the most successful political movement that does not make savings in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition position against the scratches planned (and implemented) by the Labourist Officer Alistair Darling and the next coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now elected independence only to adopt savings directed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early teenage: Adults
The research showed that the African Americans and the Spanish are reaching adolescents before their white classrooms.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
It is not demonstrated that there are hormones or other chemicals behind it
Experts argue that one of the previous puberty triggers may be a massive epidemic.
The trend of older teenages is not so visible in boys.
Former rapporteur CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should your mother be scared when her daughter grows breasts and shakes at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Children's Academy Academy this week in Orlando in Florida, a paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time assureing my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards full teenageness," Caplowitz said
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, shame on shame and in the arms and body smell, appear earlier in girls.
In the last 40 years, however, there was only a small movement in the age of the first menstruation.
In the United States, he is now the average age of 12.5 years compared to the age of 12.75 in 1970.
“When breasts develop, at least two to three years before the first menstruation,” said Caplowitz, who is also the author of the book Early Puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem” (The Frequent puberty in girls: The Unnecessary Manual for Cope with this common problem)
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed what acts the real start of puberty, but if the breast growth is accompanied by a growing spirit before 8 years of age, the girl is considered “pre-rangely mature”.
In most cases, the process is slowed or stopped — which children’s doctors can monitor carefully.
Fast growth may be the reason for endocrinologist to perform tests to eliminate serious problems such as tumour or cysta.
There are medicinal procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent the following consequences: early ageing of bones, which eventually can lead to a stop of growth and adulthood.
Recommendations on medicinal products and hormonal treatment are dependent on the age of the child, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
The psychosociological aspects are also important.
As regards medication, Caplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that “the puberty of puberty can mitigate the problems of behaviour and her feelings that they are different from their peers. ”
Another big problem is understood: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They are concerned that he can become pregnant or how he can handle hygiene," Caplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began to have a menstruation when she was 10 years old.
Although there were signs and menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school frightened and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is still no related file of evidence that there are hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual message in the media.
Boys – like girls – reach adolescents earlier.
Caplowitz is promoting the assumption that the most important reason is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study in girls aged from 6 to 9 years, connecting body fat with puberty time.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contribution factors.
In this country, African and Spanish women are inclined to reach puberty before their white pupils.
The explanations are different.
Globally, the models of early puberty appear to be affected by all possible economic conditions through climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although a low age of boys appears to be scratched in the face and shame, the trend towards the full flower of early teenage teenager is not as clear as it is in girls.
Other doctors attending the American Children’s Association Conference (AAP) added further complexity to this subject.
Even in babies and patches is common.
"We must be careful about how we identify a real puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist from the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive from their child’s doctor instructions how to talk to their child.
"It may mean a need to talk to the child before you assume," Caplowitz advised.
If you remain calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls that develop earlier need to be assured that even though this happens early, this process is a common part of life.
Nadia Convalink's as a housekeeper.
Does he have a new job?
The actress Nadia Konvalink (62) appeared behind the exhaustion of the household role and it was very good.
That the favorite Czech actress would plan to change the profession and go to the cafeteria?
Nadia Convalink showed up in James Joyce Irish pub and rolled a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right now.
Even the boss offered to hire me, and I could feed my beer.
But I refused, I'd rather stay with what I'm doing today in acting," she said with the smile of Convalink, who was a guest at the twentieth anniversary of the Irish house.
"I like Irish beer, and I'm going to have an Irish whiskey in there," she gave her taste of actress.
A long - year friend and colleague Paul New showed up for action.
I'm after death and I can't drink in this new life.
I'm allowed to have one beer or one drink a day, and I'm trying to keep it," the actor added.
The aircraft producers wish to have the width of seats, there are large orders in the bet.
A dispute about the width of seats in the second class at long distance flights, which this month caused a bitter exchange of views on air shows in Dubai.
The subject of the dispute is the width of seats provided in remote flights for the economic class – not exactly the way airlines would normally prevail, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
This week Airbus called for industrial standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economic class, but the main American rival Boeing said that airlines should decide.
The dispute occurred at the time when the aircraft producers were selling the largest version of their two-way remote aircraft with the potential record number of orders expected during the action from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear part of the plane is distributed, especially if there are 9 or 10 seats, is the basis of economic performance rights on the designs of new aircraft "mini-jumbo".
Boeing says that the improved model "777X" transports 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm distributed by 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competitive version of its A350 model will transport 350 people in 46 cm of wide economic seats distributed after 9.
The giant aircraft often attack each other in technical matters through advertising in professional media.
Airbus is now in front of an air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to get the advantage of more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently, he showed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed to the financialers a picture of three people in the restaurant with the title “Would you like it? ”
"Boeing promotes remote flights in seats higher than they are in regional turbulent aircraft," Airbus John Leahy said.
As food navigation changes, people are larger, but the seats in the planes have not dramatically changed.
Since the early 70s, when Boeing 747 Jumbo defined modern remote air transport, 10 percent increased by the age of 40 to 49, according to the United States Health Ministry.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a 100 cm passage.
Airbus claims that his rival holds the concept of seats from the 50s, where the average width of the seats of the new baptized plane was lower.
Airbus claims that it has conducted a study which suggests that the extension of the seat by 2,5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
The Boeing sizes of the Airbus seats are rejected and said it is not in the power of aircraft producers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that experience in the cabin depends on more issues than just the width of the seat.
“It is true to provide flexibility to airlines and to enable them to carry out things that they are convinced that they must make them succeed," Kent Craver said the expert on the cabin space.
They don't want us to dictate their profits.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is a major area for elbows, but for the suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect profits.
At this dispute, a race in orders of aircraft with estimated trade in the next decades worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices is sufficient to avoid an American and European export scale.
As the Reuters said in July, seat-deployment is exactly what runs the battle between the last planes.
Boeing, both Airbus and Boeing argue that they have 20 per cent better efficiency than the market representative in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
The performance rights of Boeing depend partly on comparison of model design 777X with 10 seats in order and the concept of 777 with 9 seats in order.
The profits in unit cargos are weakened compared to the 10-seadly concept.
"The reason why Boeing does this is to instruct more seats and make his planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, leading for the comfort of travellers in Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in order for existing models 777 are in line with the fact that many passengers are for a dense distribution, which can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"Forty-five centimeters a wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that the project is motivated by the threat of model 777," said Mary Kirby, the founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't add seats, but they offer a catalogue of suppliers to choose.
Aeroplane sellers are even carrying a measuring zone with them to check the competitive arrangements.
While convenient, all producers also offer aircraft with highly dense arrangements for low-income companies and regional travellers.
Airbus offers model A350 with 10 seats in order, but he says he hasn't sold it yet.
Recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater adjustment of the cabin by offering wider seats in the streets in some of his planes.
Experts say that without the support of a single producer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unacceptable, but it can prevent the wave of sale of 777X.
The number of HIV infected over the thousands in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected is increasing annually.
For example, in 2002, the tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later 121 were now, and in 2010 there was 180.
Last year, 212 were infected and it was a record number.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200, I think there is no doubt," said the expert on AIDS Miroslav Headaty, who has been leading the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, 165 patients with HIV arrived in the country from January to September last year, 176.
Since the beginning of the surveillance to the end of September, the tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, most infected in Prague.
Their number reached 1005.
In the Mediterranean region, 206 people were infected.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian County, 130 of Moravskoslesian or 116 of Ustecki.
At least the infected came from the Height, 19 of them.
A total of 88% of patients have been infected in sex.
Fourteen people in the past have been infected with blood transfusion.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the testing, in more than a quarter of the century.
With the HIV virus, six children were also born, transmitted to them from their mother.
The nonsense in Gravitation's film is, but the view is beautiful, claimed experts
The fantastic film from the universe of Gravitation was producing a movie in Czech.
In October, it was seen by the Union’s film distributors nearly 150,000 viewers and made over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews evaluate the image positively.
Others, however, find some disagreements.
The Lidovaky server.cz asked experts from the series of astronomers and astrophysics about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the movie.
Jiri Dušek (Riterator of Stars and Planetary Brno): I like scientific and fantastic films that I think are modern, dreamy tales.
The gravitation film does not explore, even though it faces as a "physical real" show.
It's not, but it doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You may notice, for example, the hair of Sandry Bullock, which somehow does not rise in a state of weight.
Hubb's space view and International Space Station are moving on a significantly different circuit route, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some movie watchers evaluate the unreally active effect and generally the whole flame behaviour in the state of gravity.
They don't think the scratches would also endure such wounds.
The heroes in the Gravitation film often get into collision with various objects and suits without bigger troubles will endure everything.
Critics were not saved, even a history confusion.
Such extensive tragedy on the Earth's orbit is not real, according to some debate.
Furthermore, he wonders why the doctor was sent to the universe to repair the technology.
People argue at the forums about the "real" behaviour of the lan.
They say it's like it's designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (the director of Stars and Planetary, see Pragues): I have seen it only on the wide platno yet, but clearly I can say, I was charmed.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary movie, it was science-fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost obliged) not to keep up consistently with reality.
"More than you mentioned disagreements touched me three times the space station with degrading technologies (the last Chinese)."
"The Chinese will be the end of the decade, and it'll probably look better than it's in the movie."
Vladimir Karas (Astronomic Institute of Sciences): In computerly generated scenes, authors are very successfully trying to do not break physical laws, so naturally oriented the audience will appreciate that at various space collisions and crashes the moment of motion, as is said by the dictionary of physics, also the view of the Earth from the universe is very realistic, including the thin columns of the atmosphere and the polar light coming in the polar areas.
Incomparisons will certainly be found in a more detailed study.
Furthermore, when I read comments, I found that the preferred direction of the circulation of various space garbage on the orbit trail appears to be in some scenes as it should actually be (from the west to the east).
Jiri Stefan (Astronomic Institute of Sciences): Some of the creators adapted to their needs, but no essential and no violating sin against logic or natural laws in the film, and in comparison with other films of similar focus, it is that the creators have relyed on the credibility of the events shown.
From the moments that don't make sense, it's worth appointing the fact that Hubbl's space rearcade is circulated by a different slope orbit than ISS.
As a result, there is a significant difference in mutual speed and the rescue operation could not actually take place as it was shown in the movie.
Then, at the moment of the department of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) I did not notice that the whole ISS would rotate, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to start when they are no longer moving towards themselves.
A new vaccine against Nikotine may take the pleasure of smoking
Scientists developed a vaccine against nikotine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
The only dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse for life from dependence on nikotine.
Before human tests, it is necessary to perform further tests that will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell's health faculty in New York says the first indications are good.
"We hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to stop and exhauste all the methods available today on the market, but they found that their dependence on Nikotine is so strong to overcome all current approaches," Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus composed of genetic information to create antinicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells that will then start creating a fluid stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies persecute all the nicotine molecules in the blood site and neutralize them before they get into the brain, thus preventing the chicken from getting a nikotine injury.
In the tests of the vaccinated mouse, which was further supplied by Nikotine, they continued to do their normal activities.
But the mouses that were not vaccinated, “relaxed, ” the researchers said, which is a sign of Nikotin getting into their brains.
Experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine magazine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections must be administered so often to maintain sufficient antibodies, so they have proved expensive and irregular.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower because they turn liver cells into plants to the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they have a taste of cigarette, and it would prevent the dependence on nikotine.
But much more likely the smokers would use it to stop.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, because of the vaccine of Nicotine, they will not benefit from it, and that will help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they noted that they needed further research.
Tripodi denies that Obeid would affect him.
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee for Corruption Surveillance.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denied that he would change the coastal rent policy on request of his political advisor, Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three propertys in the government's controlled property.
On Friday, the independent committee against corruption (ICAC) extended its search for whether Mr Obeid was lobbying in several state ministers to rent him at Circular Quay, where Obeid owned two restaurants and cafes, renewed without having to attend the election proceedings after his expiry in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi knew about the secret interests of Mr Obeid in these properties, on the basis of the evidence submitted on Thursday by the former representative of Mr. Tripodi's office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed the rentals to public competitions.
The renters were against it, and they also wanted more long-term contract terms.
In 2009, rentals for Circular Quay companies, which brought Obeids 2,5 million dollars a year, were renewed without the need to participate in the public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was the Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a favourite of public competitions.
But he rejected that the changes were made on the request of Mr. Obeid, which, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on a movement in government rental policy.
The transmission of the calls submitted in the ICAC showed the calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Tripodim and Steve Dunn, the manager who came to the port resort after he worked under Mr Obeid in the fishing department.
"Was the theme of interviews during these telephone calls the development of commercial rental policy?" the assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy Mr. Tripodi asked.
"No," Mr Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but I'm sure not about this.
Absolutely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military aircraft attacked the target in Syria, said the responsible factor
The Israeli military aircraft hit the target in the Syrian port Lazikia on Thursday night, confirmed the responsible manager of the Fox News station.
This responsible factor did not specifically say what the target was, but said that there was at least one.
The press agency Associated Press states that the target was SA-125 Russian production.
At least twice before this year, Israel launched an air attack on rocket supply in Syria.
Many things moved, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pecinka spoke so that it could be agreed, where the President Stevh screamed the dispute.
Haytman Chovanec was my suspect as soon as he was elected to the president, and he confirmed it.
The President of Saturday was always, and is the symbol of the poverty of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen showed their weaknesses mainly.
Senator Dienstbier is a principled and readable and unused, and Vice-President Zaoralek has been disabled by the most interview on TV.
Based on this, I don't see a better option than the CHSD proposed for the Prime Minister of the Vice-President of the Senate of Gaydesh, the only one would not have a starting hamper, and I think it would take a standard performance.
That's such a good solution that he's barely supported by some of the leaders.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done, and to continue without breaking the party.
Alena Gaydoschow could build a minor government without worry with only a blessing from the President of Babiša and without humans, but with the Human Health Minister, Talk, who is actually a believer social democrat.
This minimum government would have a great stability, as it would promote the proper referendum law, and it would also be obliged to support the President of the Dawn of Okamura.
The President Babish would eventually reconcile his tax progress, for he is smart and will see that it can't be done without it.
People wouldn't bring problems because the call is the best they have, and otherwise they wouldn't be in the government.
The same applies to the ANO, and there would be a valuable minister, but if they reasonably do not want to enter risky government participation, but provide support, also well.
Let's give the courage to Allen Gaydos!
Foreign workers with visa permission may be subject to the "authorization test"
As the government intends to extend police proceedings, it considers the "authorization" test for foreign workers with visa permission 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied by the criteria in order to prevent programme 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion was issued today, the former labourist Member Maxine McKew condemned the government rhetoric on foreign workers with words that it could insult the Australian neighbours.
“The voice declarations“ strangers at the end of the front” and “work first for Australians” are a very unpleasant remnant of the time the unions demanded the protected labour market”, said today to the Australian and Indian Institute.
It historically meant that white work force was to be protected – and I would not be wondering if anyone in this region recorded this historical artefact.
The discussion article discusses 12 measures considered earlier by former Minister for Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was at Sri Lance yesterday, where he deals with officials for trafficking in people, implemented five of the recommended changes and others remain to consider.
If the criteria of ‘authorisation’ are accepted, the visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is authorised for the situation where the candidate is in relation or personal connection with the owner or the relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking’.
After previous experiences with businesses that planned to sponsor a small number of employees, but then hundreds were employed, the number of visa holders of 457.
Meanwhile, a 35 - year - old man from Sri Lanka, who seeked asylum, died with suspicion of a heart attack after he arrived on the asylum ship on Christmas Islands this week.
The nine - year - old frightened son traveled with him to Australia, and after his father died in the middle, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the ship.
Australian authorities and a man rushed to a hospital in the Christmas Islands where he died.
The British government announced a study aimed at increasing the advantages of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase starts in 2026.
The Ministry of Transport, Baron Kramer, said that the project "together the United Kingdom."
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “loved” in collaboration with the British government on this plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and West Midlands.
When the phase is finished, the line from Manchester to Leeds will lead.
In June, the government re-evaluated the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and Northern England from 32.7 billion GBP to 42.6 billion GBP.
The British government, which conducted interviews with the national transport office Transport Scotland, authorised HS2, to identify further railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London for three and less hours.
Baronka Kramerová said: “Our target for HS2 is indeed a national network that better connects Britain and its cities.”
We gave SH2 green because the benefit that it brings is huge.
Without that, we face a crisis in our railway network capacity.
However, it is also about the connection – through the United Kingdom, the 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected by HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s notification is a good news for Scotland. ”
For the Scotland government, Keith Brown Mr Carmichael called to support the "disciplinary" Scottish integration in the HS2.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has the potential to bring Scotland unreasonable economic advantages, but also delivers the economic weight of Scotland in a general case the high-speed railway across Britain.”
We are therefore excited to cooperate with the British government to examine the possibilities of bringing high-speed railways to Scotland and thus bring everyone benefits and complement the Glasgow-Edinburg line, which the Scottish government plans as well.
I look forward to reviewing this study with British ministers during the next year and the joint decision on other steps.
Together with Barta, inspection and anticorruption police analysts are arrested.
Information about the arrest of Vita Barta began to spread on Thursday night when the message was brought to the First Report.cz.
The MF DAYES found that the case was taken over by the General Inspection of Security Assemblys (GIBS), its people were to arrest Barta in the centre of Prague.
It happened in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection deals with cases where police officers are accused, however, its authority applies also to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police is among the arrested officers - the leader of analytics and information Jan Petrjilek.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
The Speaking Anticorruption Police Jaroslav Ibehei, but refused to comment with the oath that the media must be turned to the GIBS.
Even her speaker inspection Radka Sandor, but she did not want to say anything to the case, referring to the City State Representativeship in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question in view of the protection of the secret facts," said the speaker of the representativeship of Stephanka Zenklova.
This unconcrete response can also lead to the fact that the event has occurred, but it is in a secret regime that does not allow speakers to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer is Oldrich Poor.
The media said that Bart represented "and in this matter," but since it's a secret information, he can't confirm Bart's arrest or dismiss.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest could be linked to former police president Peter Lessi.
It was launched in the office of Bart, along with the former VV President, Radk John, who was head of the Ministry of Interior.
The dispute that had been burnt between Peter Weather and VV even had to deal with the President Václav Klaus.
I don't know where this connection came from to my person.
No one contacted me, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about things," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became the chief of the police.
It was officially the way Radek John, who was the real boss of the party, but then he was Barta.
Barta was now running to the elections for the movement of the Dawn, the messenger's mandate only escaped him closely - about 175 votes.
The leader of the Dawn of Tomio Okamura declared that he had no idea what it was.
"Viet Barta was one of many candidates of many parties at our candidate and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the World of Direct Democracy Tomia Okamura," he distanced himself from Barta Okamura, who said before the elections he gave Bart space to run for the Dawn, because he helped him solve the problem of executives.
Vietnam Barta came to court in 2012 with his former partner from VV Jaroslav Scarka.
Regulations on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft shall remain in Australia for the time being in force
The travellers of Australian airlines will still have to turn off their tablets and smart phones during launching and landing, regardless of the changes in the United States to mitigate the regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Air Management (FAA) has given American companies space to change their procedures, so passengers will be able to read electronic books on their devices, watch videos or play games during critical fly phases, if the equipment remains in the "air" regime.
The travellers can do this already during the majority of the flight, but many are bothering to have access to their electronic books during the launch and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision which requires a large piece of work from American carriers to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not have a short time to change their procedures.
The Agency for Civil Aviation Safety (CASA) also said that this notification was examined, but emphasized that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical fly phases are still in force in Australia.
‘CASA does not currently have any specific rules governing the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft’, he stated.
This question is covered by the provisions that require the aircraft operators to ensure that the safety will be maintained throughout the period and that passengers are acting in accordance with the safety instructions obtained from the crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken with CASA about expanding the use of its wi-fi discharge system, has been inclined to change, but notified that the decision of the regulatory authority will be taken into account.
"We would welcome if the CASA Authority conducted analysis of permission to use electronic devices, because we really think it would improve customers' experiences now that we have (without-board fun)," the speaker said.
The company Qantas announced that it will now follow the current rules.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during the flight and landing, and we do not intend to change it in a rapid time," he said.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
But we are constantly interested in the development in the regulatory area that can be useful for our travellers, and we certainly examine the FAA decisions and the reasons that are behind it.
In the case of air carriers from the United States, the impact of the rules will differ from the company and will depend on the age of their air park.
Transporters will have to testify that their aircraft can tolerate radio interruptions of mobile phones, as well as revise the manuals, training materials, manual suitcases and information for passengers.
“When the airline confirms its fleet tolerance, the passengers can use transmitting and light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smart phones, at any altitude," FAA said.
In rare cases, the low visibility crew will order passengers to turn off during landing.
The group also recommended that the harder equipment during the flight and departure be safely stored under seats or in the storage space above the head.
With the growing poor high-class in Singapore, they experience a flower
In the shopping center of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops the golden bracelet, ring and earrings so that she can pay her daughter.
"We just bought a house with our husband and I gave all my money for it," said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although every month as the Administrator receives $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, the family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
The demand across the areas of South-Eastern Asia – where household debt is increased – is, indeed, the company ValueMax, where the woman is carrying out its transaction, took place on the third stake on the ladder in Singapore this week.
The stop of jewelry is not just a quick way to borrow cash – 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsafe bank loans.
In Singapore, stakeholders normally apply the annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, closely over 15.4 per cent of the United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch office in the same shopping center.
However, the stakeholders have the advantage that they do not require verifications of a person (payment history) or a receipt document and may provide a loan faster than the banks.
Therefore, with the pressure of families because of the increased cost of life and the growing debt of households and consumer debt, millions of people around the region are turning to the stakeholders.
After five years of strong growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans supported by the emptied monetary policy in advanced economies, families with low and medium income turn to stakeholders in order to address the worsening financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's quoted an increase in the use of household loans in particular due to increased rents as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditability.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in Asia.
Malaysia is headed by a 80 per cent GDP ladder, which is an increase compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economies were also afraid of the high level of consumption debt in Thailand, which just came from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed the continuing weak exports and the weakening of consumer demand.
"It's important that people from high to low [receiving scale] will try to complete their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an econome in the Malaysia bank CIMB.
The historically high prices of gold in the past two years have contributed to the embarrassment of their personal property and the opportunity to exchange for the cash of their family jewelry.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 urban factories form gold.
People say, the gold price looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and we get it back next month.
The largest personnel in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded the increase in the number of customers using its flagship in recent months to 20 per cent.
The growth in the stakeholder sector is so large that ValueMax, the branch operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to the neighbouring Malaysia – where he has four branches – but even outside Asia, says Executive Director ValueMax Da Lee Ching.
This will be funded by using 60 per cent of the 66 million SGD that she received on the Singapore Bureau this week.
While some discounted creditors have experienced criticism under fire due to high interests, Mrs Yes says that the flag offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also directly does not increase debt.
“Publics stop the objects already owned, and the cashing of personal property does not increase the household debt”, he says.
In the company, the flag of property is increasingly accepted as a means to ensure short-term, secure funding.
In addition, among those who use the stakeholders, they are not just people in financial distress.
Wealthy people from Singapore also use the ValueMax branches when they stop gold rods or Rolex watches, so they can reach up to 60 percent of the cash purchase price.
Our customers are of all possible circumstances.
"They belong to rich individuals who need to borrow shortly for their courageous trades or investments, or small enterprises who need help to solve problems in their cash flow," said Mrs. Daowa.
Sometimes they just need money as fast as possible.
Saving package of $325 million for Tasman health
The Federal Government insists that a rescue package of $325 million for commercial health in Tasmania contains hard conditions to ensure that the government does not lose its financial resources.
The Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is making “accelerated measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the island's ageing population, the higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Financing for four years has been decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilk.
"The government came with an emergency rescue package, which, we believe, will solve the specific problems that the State faces," Ms. Plibersek said today.
The package of $325 million contains $31 million for surgery on the patient's request.
The following 2600 operations, including ortopedic operations and grey tissue operations, will help to eliminate debt.
Money is also available on free clinics in Hobart and Launcestone, better pooperation care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health records in local hospitals.
"Those investments respond to the ideas the front clinic doctors told me that they would best help the Tasman health system," Mrs Plibersek said.
The Ministry stressed that the Tasman government must require a strict reporting regime and recording obligations.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive the money of the Australian Union and to inform monthly where additional funds have been made.
A three-member committee will be established to ensure that the State delivers services as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would not be worth anything, "as long as a real reform will be followed in order to establish a more sustainable basis for the Tasman public health system".
Nevertheless, he praised the government for his response to his request for accelerate assistance, which he first made in negotiations with the President of the Government in the beginning of May.
"I believe that the Federal Assistant Package can free public health from critical state," Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the government, these additional electoral procedures will significantly reverse the recent shortcomings.
Peter Dutton, a speaker of the federal opposition in the field of health, believes that today’s statement is just a “face. ”
"The reason why I'm here is that the labour government has exempted 430 million dollars from our health system," ABC TV told.
You can't have a government that takes nearly half a billion dollars, and the Australian union, which is devoted to $300 million, and seem to be a good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that no dollar from the rescue package will be issued to a higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted a novel to Denise Diderota, which brings exceptional film explosion and time formation, but is also more boring than it should be.
In the 1960 ’ s, they go to France and tell a dark story about Suzanne, a young noble managing family to the monastery.
When he revolts, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from a criminally disgusted mother presented and becomes an object of sexual passion for another.
The film never slides to greed or sensation, and that's his problem.
The ceremony of this story leads to that the viewers will also experience torture similar to wearing a harvested shirt.

Syria destroyed its means to produce chemical weapons, says the supervisory authority
Syria destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, said the Committee on Global Oversight of Chemical Weapons on Thursday, while strong conflicts in the northern country, near one of the places where the poisonous substances are allegedly stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activeist group also declared that more than 120 000 people were killed since the start of civil war almost three years ago.
Notification of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
by the term established by the Hague organization to destroy or disable the operation of all chemical weapons and machinery equipment for the mixing of chemical substances in order to create poisonous gas and ammunition.
The completion of this in principle of the starting phase of destruction is an important milliner in the ambitious timetable which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus by half of 2014.
Destruction of equipment means Syria won't be able to produce new chemical weapons anymore.
However, the Damasch still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is expected that this country has approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemical substances and weapons, including yperite and sarin nervous gas.
The notice came at the time when the fights in Safira, which the experts spoke of as a site of the chemical weapons and storage factory, said the Syrian Observer for Human Rights in Britain.
The group of activists, who monitored the total number of victims through the network of activists in Syria, announced on Thursday that 120 296 people died.
There should be 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government, 29,954 members of the armed forces of Basar Asada, 18,678 ruling warriors and 187 armed men from the Libanon Hizballah.
Among the dead are also 2,202 government crossers and approximately 5,375 opposition warriors, many of whom are aliens.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people died since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million inhabitants to leave the country.
Assad's units fought in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have been connected to Al-Qaida for weeks.
The observer said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but had no specific numbers.
The fights underlined the dangers faced by inspectors for chemical weapons, who, at their mission, when in the middle of the Civil War, Syria is to eliminate the chemical arsenal, must deal with close terms.
In a statement from the OPCW, which is closely cooperating with the United Nations, its team was now “happy to verify – and observed the destruction – the Syrian declared essential equipment for production and mixing/completion”.
He added that “no other control activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of 23 places declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said that due to security concerns, they were unable to visit two places.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that these two places were “released and... the elements of the chemical weapons programme that it contained were transferred to two other declarations that have been verified”.
It was not immediately clear whether the device in Safira was one of the places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria agreed to the plan of the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
"I beg the courage and courage that you have shown in the fulfillment of this most difficult mission that this organization has ever had," said Ahmet Uzumcu, director of observers in your comment by the OPCW.
Now, in his third year, it stands against each other in the civil war, especially the sunny Muslim rebels and the Government of Assad with their security forces full of members of the Alawit Sect, over the Shiit Islam.
With regard to further development, Chief of Observer Rami Abdul Rahman said that there was a strong explosion inside the air defence device in the Syrian coastal province Lazikia.
He said the cause of the explosion was not known.
Anger on the judgment issued against the founder of a bomb attack on Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 killed in a bomb attack on Bali in 2002 responded angryly to the judgment issued over the last of the founders who were built before justice and said Umar Patek was to be executed.
The patch, who spent almost 10 years running as one of the most searched persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years of prison for compiling the explosive device used in the bomb attack.
In 15 years, he could be released conditionally.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder when attacking two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty in several other areas of charges related to terrorism, including a series of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas night 2000.
The prosecution demanded lifetime, although it could insist that a man with the name “Demolition Man” (boatman) had been sentenced by his reputation of an expert on the production of explosives.
This decision renewed the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39 - year - old twins Jane and Jenny in the destructive attack of Patek and other founders nearly ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek was supposed to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should go in the tracks of the others.
For AAP, Mrs. Corteen said: “It should be built before an executive unit. ”
I have to live with no other grandchildren and my daughters every day.
The Sari club was compared to the country when a strong load stored outside the parked truck was launched shortly after the 23th hour.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier, the suicide assassinated man fired the bag filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a motion for a month, and while he was kept alive, three times “death. ”
Mr. Hughes said that Pateka should meet the same fate as three other members of the terrorist cell, Jama Islamia responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudru – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get a death punishment like no one.
Keeping him alive... no reason to keep him alive, he's just not.
To get 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of other people, it's not that much.
Patek was standing in court as the last of the Bali assassinates.
The arrest was avoided for almost ten years, but finally in January 2011 he was caught in the Pakistanian city Abbottabad, where nearly four months later the American forces killed the former leader of Al-Kaida Osama bin Ladin.
During the trial, the FBI agent stated in his testimony that the reports of the rapporteurs revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Ladine in an effort to re-establish the link between the terrorist groups from southern Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He did not give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
Until today, he did not feel sorry for how much grief he caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include the ceremony on Bali and Australia.
"We will see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
The patch can still be revoked against the judgment.
FAA: Travelers in air transport can now use technological equipment in aircraft (but cannot call from their mobile phones)
Air Company passengers will be able to use their electronic devices “from the gate to the gate” – except calls from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watching movies and listening to music on the basis of unheartedly expected new rules issued by the Federal Air Management (FAA) on Thursday.
But the travellers do not expect the changes to come immediately.
As soon as the change will be introduced, according to individual airlines, the FAA manager Michael Huerta said at the press conference.
The airlines will have to report the FAA management as long as their aircraft meet the new rules and update the training guides for the shipping crew and the directive for the storage of equipment in order to be in accordance with the new rules.
FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of transported electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already transmitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“We can improve the extensive use of electronic devices very quickly, depending on the state of this plan” FAA said in its statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smart phones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches the height of 3 miles and the captain gives permission.
The passengers are expected to turn their equipment off again when the plane falls down to land, and they do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic disturbance may allow their passengers to use their equipment during the flight, landing and driving, the FAA has stated.
Since most of the new aircraft and other aircraft, which have been modified so that passengers can use Wifi at a higher altitude, the criteria are expected to be fulfilled.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
"When new rules are safely introduced -- and we will work closely with transport companies -- this will be a success," Glading said in her statement.
Honestly, we are tired of looking like “the guards. ”
However, surfing on the Internet, sending e-mails and texting or downloading data will continue to be prohibited under 3 miles of altitude, said the Agency.
The travellers will be informed to switch their smart phones, tablets and other devices into the airline.
So still no Words with friends, online game type scrabble played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when he was, as well known, expelled from the American Airlines plane, because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And the harder devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored because of the fear that they could hurt someone if they flyed by the cabin.
Mobile phone calls will still be prohibited on board.
The rules for use of mobile phones are not FAA but the US Federal Telecommunications Committee.
FAA may cancel the prohibition in certain electronic devices during the flight and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transport Security Committee, National Transport Security expert, said that mobile phones are still considered risky.
"Mobile phones are indeed a problem, not only because they can potentially create disruptions with navigation devices, but from the FCC data we also know that in the air they can cause disruption of radio towers," Rosenker said.
The Office Advisory Committee established by the FAA management in order to examine this problem, proposed last month that the government allow wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been pressured in recent years to mitigate restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a democrat from Missouri, claim that there is no legal security reason for this ban.
Constraints are also increasingly difficult because the use of such devices is everywhere present.
Some studies suggest that until a third of the passengers forget about the obligation to disable or ignore their facilities.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices traveling in 1966 in response to navigation and communication equipment when passengers started carrying FM radios, the technical equity of the time.
New airlines are much more linked to electrical systems than previous generations planes, but are also designed and approved by the FAA management to resist electronic disruption.
In years, airlines have offered a travelling Wi-Fi in travelling oversea heights.
Plans adjusted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
The large majority of airlines should be adjusted under the new rules for greater use of electronic devices, said Huert.
The current electronic devices generally explore much less intensive radio radios than it was in previous generations.
For example, electronic readers issue only a minimum broadcast when turning the page.
But the broadcast is stronger when the devices download or send the data.
Among those who push to release restrictions for use of these passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the representatives of this company charged the aircraft with their electronic readers of Kindle and carried out test flights, but no problem occurred.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these equipment represent any risks.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Aviation Travelers said he is convinced that the disruption from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee declared that there are only partial reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause disruption of air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA allow the pilots to order passengers to shut down the equipment during flying according to low-visible devices.
The travel industry group welcomed these changes and is based on a reasonable procedure for the traveling public that technology uses in a large extent.
"We are pleased that FAA recognized the pleasant travel experience is not in contrast with security," said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported aircraft from a floating area in the North Sea and released back to nature
The bird was transported on the coast after he was found exhausted on the oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back to the free nature.
One helicopter was transferred to Aberdeen last month after he was treated by the Scotland SPCA in the rescue center before he recovered.
Colin Seddon, operating centre, said: “This screaming must have migrated from northern Europe when a strong wind caught him over the North Sea. ”
According to all, he was out of power and refuge on the oil plate.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was unable to fly again, so they contacted us with the request for help. ”
At the time he was released, he was in good condition and health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to connect companies and to define what changes the EU would like to see British businessmen and job-building companies.
To this end, we have given the biggest and most complex survey in which we have asked the front entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 managers representing British enterprises of different sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the research will be for many surprises.
We have discovered that the rude majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that modernize and grow, while the EU countries are retrieving.
They want to see how the government prefers new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than enter into a long and hard process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When we asked about their views on specific political areas — from monopoly regulations to products laws — the majority of entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market, and the entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now overlook the benefits of being part of the European commercial area – even 40 percent of large enterprises, which is traditionally the most pro-European society.
And eventually, our examination of the leading businesses revealed the most explicit knowledge, while a clear majority wants Britain to seek to change the contract and relations with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings identified by different size companies and the main business group show that the business sector is pushing on a “sensitive change” that will bring the impact back to Britain.
There is a lot in the bet – the acquisition of a change in the contract and the better agreement for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16% in the EU's referendum.
The President of the government should not hesitate: this research shows that the British trade supports its plan for the novelization of the conditions of the British membership in the EU.
This also shows that the business sector expects that this novelisation will mean a significant move from the current force exports back towards Britain.
The better agreement for Britain may be and given how the euro area is being made to travel for a higher economic and fiscal union, even more necessary.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our research show, for business, this means re-orientation of trade and fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
John Kerry admitted: spying has gone too far!
The United States have been spying sometimes "too far," according to the AFP head of US diplomacy John Kerry during the video conference between Washington and London.
However, a collection of information, according to the minister, served to reverse terrorist attacks.
"The first confession from Washington" according to the AFP sounded in the middle of a strong dispute on both the Atlantic shores due to a scandal discovery of a bunch of data monitoring by the American National Security Agency (NSA), which was targeted by American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as did the President (Barack Obama), some of these actions have gone too far and we assure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
But in the interview, he was primarily defending the practical practices.
The collection of information is essential for the fight against terrorism and prevention of assassinations such as attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We have prevented the aircraft from falling, buildings exploding and people were murdered because we were able to be informed in time," Kerry emphasized.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went unproperly far."
Afera around an American intelligence, which reportedly watched hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Otherwise, the Americans were watching the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The European leaders did not hide anxiety and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach agreements with the United States that would preclude or limit the monitoring.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says the tube in Bulgaria starts a new gas era
Starting the construction of South Stream gas in Bulgaria means launching one of the largest European energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"We are witnesses of the messenger today: Building on the Bulgarian part of South Stream Gazprom Alexei Miller, the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Alexei Miller in his statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipe should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazpro and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, the officials say.
Miller says that direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "ever" removed.
Once the entire project starts its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from South Stream gas water at a cheap price.
The Gazprom said that the construction is to start in other countries in the direction of flow in the end of this year.
The gas pipeline is designed for the annual capacity of 2.2 billion cubic gas stops.
Hizballah sent thousands of warriors to Syria.
There's a decisive battle waiting for them.
The Lebanese Movement of Hizballah placed 15,000 of its warriors north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle on the mountain area Kalamún.
According to Israel’s continuing reports on middle attacks, two locations in Western Syria destroyed the missiles designed just Hizballahu.
This Libanon Shiit organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the foreign army.
Her programme is also a fight against Israel, which does not interfere with Syrian conflict, but clearly said that it would prevent the transfer of arms to Hizbollah's hands to Libanon.
Reports on central Israeli attacks on weapons stocks in Western Syria are only being explicit.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by American sources.
According to Syrian Dampress.com web site, rockets burned from the Mediterranean region of the Syrian missile base Snubar Jabla south of Latakia.
The rapporteur's station of Al-Arabia claims that two warehouses in which the missiles were prepared to transport to Libanon were affected.
According to her sources, it was a rocket of Russian production SA-8.
Israel refused to comment, but the military analyst Ron Ben Jišaj said that Syria is continuously trying to supply Hizballah with missiles and Syrian aircraft teaching members of the armed Hizballah section to treat missiles.
SA-8 are old missiles that the Syrian army has had since the '80s.
They're located on a moving drive.
Although they are relatively primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions, it is easy to hide.
They're equipped with a radar that turns off after the shooting, so it's hard to focus.
Latakia is located in Western Syria, in the area of ruling alavita.
It's a well preserved area, and Hizballah was in the past in the fights in Western Syria.
He claims to help protect the Syrian Shiit community that belongs to the alavites.
Now allegedly 15,000 of his warriors are ready to help win the army back Kalamun.
In addition to Hizballah, the Syrian army also strengthens its units.
Kalamún lies between Damascus and the third largest city of the Homs.
The battle should be answered by the source of al-Arabia for the recent attack of the opposition to the command of the Syrian Shiit Brigade of Abu Fadla Abbasa in the Shiit part of Damascus.
Hizballah helped the Syrian army to fight back the town of Kusair at the Libanon border this year.
Many rebels from Kusairo have just gone to Kalamun.
Recently, most citizens in the Czech Republic seemed to have wanted early elections.
For reasons, corruption, disbursement of money for predicted purchases and public procurement, tax increases and government scandals have been introduced.
According to the results of the elections, most citizens have responded to this condition.
In fact, they were satisfied with the state that was here (thefting and debt of this state).
Otherwise, I can't explain that 3 413 497 voters did not reach elections, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters, therefore, totally 4 394 028 have supported the original government coalition, representing 52.16% of all voters of law.
Which is a super-half majority.
When I attach 1 016 829 voters to the above, then with an old order (because all those parties participated in the "fting" and debt of this State), 64.23% of the voters actually agreed with this condition.
In fact, the majority of the voters have shown that they are not stealing and renewing for the punishment of the guilty.
Or do you think the members of the ČSSD who participated in this are laying down appropriate laws?
Is it ever helping us?

The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) were accused before complaints against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission for Sexual Exploitation of Children learned that before the charges against the child's instructor Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Youth Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were charged with sexual abuse of children.
But before the committee, it sounded that in its initial statement to the Commission, this association stated that they had never solved the child’s sexual abuse in their organization.
The Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked when one of YMCA employees was accused of the offences relating to child pornography, and another when a caringbah trainer from the YMCA association was convicted in 1991 for sexual disturbance of children who were in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the advisor of the Commission that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the initial statement of the YMCA association was also incorrect when it stated that an external audit was carried out in the YMCA organization which evaluated this organization as the front advocate of children's rights.
The evidence submitted by the Commission indicates that the YMCA was notified that the second of the four possible estimates were received in the Ministry of Education and Company audit of August.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA association when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him on the ground down failed when the Lord accepted, without seeing whether the staff is aware of the obligation to notify violations of the rules of child safety.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted for sexual disturbance of 12 boys who were committed for two years when he worked in the YMCA association.
He was trapped for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA association had a cultural problem that prevented the staff from reporting the safety of children to Mr Lord.
The staff members gave evidence that they were witnesses of such violations, including that Lord was alone with children, privately watched them, let them sit on his knees, told them he loved them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was the Lord's superior and asked for training for the safety of children because she was concerned about his behaviour, confirmed that Jacqui Barnat, who was head of the services of children in the YMCA Association in Caringbah, who was Lord's supervisor, was “very frightening and often difficult to talk to him about something. ”
The Director-General said that they did not accept the evidence of staff that they were not aware if they had to contact their supervisors and the actions to report.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had eclipsed their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said that the YMCA council in New South Wales had told his view that the lessons from “Jonathan Lord’s case” for the organization were that the staff“ did not report” and the council agreed with it.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to allow the staff to sign agreements on silence shortly after the charges were appeared, the general manager for children's services in the YMCA Liam Whitley organization.
He said that the goal was to avoid disturbance of evidence, but it was “excessively zealous ” and misconducted.
The expert for sexual abuse of children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffit's University, told the Commission that YMCA in New South Wales was not a organisation that would be safe for children in 2009 to 2011.
He said there were serious problems in the recruitment, checking, working, training and management of staff.
The hearing was delayed on December 20th.
Tony Blair said he would use the chance to return to the ministerial post, but he admitted that return was unlikely.
In the night conversation on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the 59-year-old politics, he expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when Mr. Blair resigned after ten years in the leading position, he mostly avoided talks about British politics and limited his comments to foreign matters and his role as Ambassador of the BBC peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of the Minister, his response to the London Evening Standard said: "Yes, of course, but it is hard to find out, so..."
While a team of experts in Cardiff was gathered in Cardiff to play horses to fight for the price of the Horse of the year, it was clear that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although they're still not going to school and only a few months ago made the first steps, this boy and his animal pet, the Shetland Pony Toffee, swiped three wheels smoothly to get the main price and left 30 rivals behind.
These unresolved couples – with the same height – were commended for the appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition operated by the Sunnybank Rider Centre in Rudry village near Cardiff.
He stood against the gentlemen and the ladies in elegant hats, put his barrel in a joyful corner, and let his two-year-old Toffee work around the circle.
Fenton was praised to the jury for his natural ability to control the horse, which far above his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks of view and personality.
Fenton Toffee got his third birthday in March and since then he exercised this Shetland pony daily.
His mother Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are doing great work. ”
They didn't make great hopes, but finally they left with a golden cup and a flower.
It was only the second time he contested with Toffe, and when he won, we were excited.
Everyone considered him a phenomenal and completely stranger people wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantiglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales walks in his aunt Sharon Howells, showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere, and everyone was encouraging and clapping. ”
He ran the sand all over the length of the arena, and even though he worked so small, he gave great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has got two chickens in charge.
Given how he started, he'll be back soon at the Horse of the year, and I'm sure he'll do well.
The speaker’s annual contest of horses said: “The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control the pony. ”
They're a great team together.
The jury picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they showed up in the competitive circle.
They always watch how good the team work between the pony and the one who leads him – and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the tube.
I'm sure Fenton's been helping with a cute clothing, and he was really in there.
Too curious newspapers are to be examined
The Chinese newspapers, which asked on the title page to release a reporter accused of the voyage, will be explored thoroughly, said the press manager.
The New Express newspaper in Guangzhou has made a rare public request for the release of Chan Yongzhoua.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes to invent some of the company owned by the state.
The manager said that the New Express newspaper will now carry out the "full repair".
The Regulation came from the State Office for Press and Publishment, Radio, Film and Television in Kuang-Tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that, between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper of the Yangcheng Group of Evening News issued several false reports on that company Zoomlion.
"The direct management of the New Express newspaper was unauthorized," said the manager in his statement.
He said he had to decide "to put Chen Yongzhou on administrative punishment in the form of annulment of the journal licence".
Furthermore, “he ordered the Yangcheng group Evening News to make a general fixing of New Express, and recommended that the relevant responsible persons in New Express be investigated and immediately changed the leadership of New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote for New Express several articles relating to financial disagreements in the company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper issued on the title page two requests for his release and claimed to be worth his reporting work.
But then Mr. Chen showed up on state television and confessed that he issued false stories for reimbursement.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and to the whole media sector and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to the CCTV State Reporting Station.
I did it mostly because I wanted money and glory.
I realize I was wrong.
After apologizing for Mr. Chena, Mr. New Express issued an apology on the title page in which he stated that he failed when he did not carry out sufficient control of his reports.
Recently, a number of closely monitored suspects have been confessed on TV.
Experts say that confession is still regularly forced, regardless of the change in the law of this year, which prohibits the authorities to force anyone to blame themselves.
Found a tunnel for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most predominant tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, supplemented with its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
The U.S. authorities described a tunnel about the dimensions of approximately one meter as one of the most prominent secret halls they've ever discovered.
The tunnel that clicks on the length of nearly six football fields connects the warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of indefinite warehouses, where the cars can be easily hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
The authorities stated that the tunnel was closed before drugs could have been transported uncertainly.
In addition to the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also held eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine according to the court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of holding marijuana and cocaine to distribute them.
In the case of condemnation, he faces the penalty of deprivation from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, the smugglers invade into large sewage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest hall in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the harvest of marijuana in Central Mexico, which builds a problem before drug cartels as soon as possible to get their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a hallway at about 650 meters equipped with railways that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economy and Centre are connecting management.
For example, a common advertising
New integrated newsroom of Economy in Prague Karlin.
The Economy company has made another step to transform the holding of the Centre into its media house.
Since Friday, the Economy and the Centre have shared top management.
"Union organisational structure and the staff union are essential to integrate both publishing into the common media house," comments the changes made by the Vice-President of the Economy and the authorised Director-General Kamil Čermák.
The head of the Universal Management will be complemented by the Executive Director of the Holding Centre Andreas Demuth.
The new joint director of the trade was named Paul Vaparil, who is also subject to the advertising director of both Zuzana Tylcher.
The new head of information technology has become Stephen Burd.
The joint director of the editions is Vladimir Piskaček, whose team is also director for the transformation of Jacob Unger.
The newly established marketing director function was authorised by Adolilla Pitts.
The single office of corporate communication is newly managed by Vera Lhotska.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, managing human resources for both publications leads Peter Slab.
"The new organizational structure, inter alia, will allow us to come to the market with a common offer of investment products, better connect to the creation of content of all the titles issued and, in the latest, significantly efficiency in the company's business management," Čermak added.
The Economy, owned by Zdenek Bakala, concluded a contract on the purchase of the Centre Holdings and its Czech daughters at the end of April.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings forms servers Currently.cz, Women.cz, Web portals, broad mail base under the Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB Agency More or more than two dozen smaller websites.
Economy is the publisher of Economic newspapers, IHNED.cz reporting servers, weeks Respect and Econome, and the number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among the Czech publishers is the long-term most successful in selling digital versions of their main titles.
This year, in June, the publisher moved into newly built modern space in Prague Karlina.
CME will target TV business.
They'll release almost a quarter of people.
The CME media group will be released.
By the end of the year, he wants to die by a thousand people.
He's willing to cut all side activities and he only wants to focus on his main business, television.
The group owned in Czech TV Nova and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of 4,500 people.
There's almost a quarter of people going to lose work.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is CET 21, which holds licences for television stations Nova, New Cinema, New Sport, Fanda, Smileov, Telka and the Czech version of the MTV music station.
How much savings will affect Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the local TV TV TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"It's too early and we can't really comment on it," said New Joseph Kokoliček, director of communication.
According to MF DNES, the significant release of Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but from far the greatest impact should have on the personal states of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new heads of the New Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who came after a long-term director Adrian Sarbu during the middle conference call with analysts, talked about trying to limit all activities that were not directly related to the TV business.
It is therefore quite likely that it significantly reduces the cost of production of own series, film and production activities.
In the industrial area of the CCP in Prague, the cooling tower burned at night
In the Producing Area, the CCP in Prague burned a high-capacity tank, according to firefighters, apparently cooling towers.
"To the fire, firefighters were driving on Thursday before 11:00 a.m., the fire was still extinguished this morning," the speaker of the Prague firemen Paulina Adamc announced.
The quantity of injury in the air in the area according to measurement did not exceed the allowed limits.
The above damage and the causes of the fire are still unknown.
In Colben Street, about five dozens of firemen arrived gradually.
"One of the fires of a large-capacity tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"The area does not find a functional hydrant network, so we extinguish through transport control from tanks," she added.
According to the server, it complicated the exhaustion of the badly functioning hydrant network, so the firefighters had to deliver the water from the other place.
The firefighting commander announced the second degree of fire alarm.
There are a total of four, the fourth is declared in the most important situations.
The chemicals also arrived to check the level of dangerous substances that could get into the air at the fire.
"But they did not target in the air the quantity of harm that would exceed hygiene standards," said the firefighter speaker.
The British Police delivered Assange's release notice
Today, the British police delivered a notice of the publication of the founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuador Embassy in London, where he asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard declared that he delivered to 40 - year - old Australian “a notice of publication” by asking him to join the police station and that if he does not, he could be arrested.
Assange, under the British Law, exhausted his possibilities when the Supreme Court this month canceled his appeal against the issue, and faces the issue to Sweden for the charges of sexual crimes.
Because he was afraid that Stockholm would send him to the United States, he searched for a refuge at the Ecuador Embassy in London on 19 June, where he asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard “familiarly informed a 40-year-old man to be sent to the police station on the day and the hour he was assigned to him,” said the speaker.
Assange continues to violate the conditions of bail.
The embassy refused to make comments.
Assange fears that Sweden will be issued to the United States where he can face the charges of spying because he published 250,000 US diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver got a penalty of 1,000 pounds for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his feet.
The motorist got a penalty of 1,000 pounds for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his feet.
Andrew Howie (35) from Tiptree, Essex, was seen in his Mercedes Benz on the road A120 in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, she found out that she had a glass of drink between her hips.
At the police court in Colchester Howie, he confessed to accuse him of driving immediately and immediately.
Seven points arrived on his account, which resulted in a six-month ban on the procedure.
Howie was also ordered to pay the cost of 90 pounds and an appendix for the charged 100 pounds.
As a result of tax on foreign property owners, the breach london bubble
The Ministry of Finance has preliminaryly calculated the tax from the amount of financial assets, but awaits the final decision of Mr Osborn, which in the 2012 budget presented a 7 % fee for transfer of property for buildings at a price of over 2 million pounds and annual taxes for buyers owning property within the company, not as individuals.
In 2012/13, the revenue from the estate transfer fee in the Westminster and Kensington districts, which reached 708 million pounds in tax 2012/13, already exceeds the total sum for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook said: “In view of the increase in the transfer of property in high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argument that property of high value is a little taxed, regardless of the effect of the aged tax system.”
He added that “this step could have caused some foreign investors to avoid buying property in London, if the existing owners are not selling”.
Front properties – upper 5 % to 10 % of the housing market according to the price – in a rich belt that reaches from Fulham to Wimbledon, have been recorded with 11,8 % increases last year.
The prices in the middle of London continue to show a constant growth of 5,6 % per year, but have been shaded by the growing “home market”, which, according to the research of the Savils' real estate office, experienced the southwest, north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) of the increase.
Scientists lightened more how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
Former studies showed that joyful dogs swings more right (of the dog’s view), while nervous dogs wave their tails mainly left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can record and react these delicate differences in their tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, neurobiologist at Trent University, said: “The humans are well known that the left and right side of the brain have a variety of incentives that stimulate positive or negative emotions. ”
We tried to observe the same in other species.
He added that, as in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for the left movements and on the other hand, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to obtain further information about how dogs react to the unreasonable tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals watching movies on other dogs.
They measured the pulmonary frequency of these animals and analysed their behaviour.
Apparently, it won't take long to understand why their tails are sometimes going to one side, and another to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We produced dog films about dogs — whether in natural version or in the form of a force — to get rid of any distracting incentives, and we also managed to adjust the tail movement and illustrate it more right or left."
When the animals saw another unexplicit dog moving their tail to the right (of the look of the dog swing with the tail), she remained completely calm.
But when she recorded the tail scrolling mainly left (new from the sight of the dog swinging with a tail), their temper frequency increased, and the animals were uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think the dogs would communicate consciously through these movements.
She thinks that the dogs learned from experience what movements they have to and which they must not be careful.
He said: “If you meet the dogs several times and the movement of their tails in one direction is repeatedly connected with friendly behaviour and traffic produces less friendly behaviour, you will react on the basis of this experience. ”
Researchers say that findings can help the owners of dogs, veterinarians and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
The dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a high-school dog teacher at Bristol University, said that it was not the first study that studied whether the left and right side of the dogs was important.
Last year, the Lincoln University team found that the dogs were turning their heads on the left when they watched the aggressive dog, and on the right when they were looking at a cheerful dog.
And in another professional debate from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “It was a dog robot with dogs who were more likely to list when he was turning his tail on the left than the transport, when they were rather uncertain — exactly in contrast with the Italian study. ”
Difference can be given by dogs in these different studies of animals in movies or dog robots not fully interpreted as dogs.
He explained that it could help study how dogs react to real dogs.
“Although there are good evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be explained – and dogs are not exceptional," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behaviour, it will certainly not take long to understand why their tails are sometimes going to one side and another.

Pope František appoints the first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope František, on February 22, first appointed the new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the pope and are those who chose the pope, so Francis will set up their first group of men who will eventually help to choose his successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches 80 years of age, the pope's choices are no longer participating – the group is reduced to 120 electoral cardinals.
In a statement notifying this report, Federico Lombardi, speaker of Vatican, said that before the celebration of the new cardinals, the meeting of the current cardinals, known as a consitorium, will be held.
"Pope František decided to communicate his decision to convey the February consitorium in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero from Catholic Voices said that the number of voluntary cardinals will probably fall down by February.
He said that the pope usually names as many cardinals as it takes to increase the number of voters to 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wants.
The consitorium next year will be important, because it will be the first time after Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At this point, certain orientations are being shown to Europe and Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they only have a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since František established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, which has given a task to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope made all his own decision.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that “it is quite possible, ” that these cardinals of the pope would ask for advice.
But we weren't in this situation before – it's a complete news.
Valero said that the Popes traditionally elevated the position of the Cardinals of Bishops from large places, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don't know who he names. ”
GM downloads some new light trucks in the United States for repair of seats
According to the Friday notification from the U.S. Auto Safety Authority, General Motors downloads nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) light cars Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra to fix the disturbance with manual loading of the support.
In some of these vehicles, the mechanism for loading the front seats may be disturbed.
As a result, the seats are not in line with the federal standards of car safety for heads.
The notifications on the websites of the National Transport Safety Management (NHTSA) state that “as the vehicle in the backwards gets a hit, the head resistance must not protect the passengers properly, which increases the risk of injury”.
The downloaded models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM has introduced a supplier on the market in June and for this front American car, the most important placement of the vehicle on the market from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
The GM informed the owners of the van on the disturbance in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the notifications to owners due to the 16-day government infusion that weakened the sales of cars in October.
The supplies of Silverado and Sierra, which were processed for the 2014 models, increased during the first 10 months of this year to approximately 20 per cent, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 models of Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models from its vans.
The New York Bureau shares increased on Friday afternoon by 1.4 per cent to 37.47 USD.
A desperate scream of Obam's voter
I voted twice – I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have revealed the obstructions of the Republican Party
Obstructive policy cannot excuse the strain of Obama's healthcare websites or the attacks of droneless aircraft
Obama's 2008 campaign memoaries are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine in Harvard for the second year.
In these days I read a very sad book.
I thought of this book that during the cloud days of my second anniversary, I would be encouraged at the medical faculty and rebuilt hope in me.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and it is the memories of the presidential campaign Baracka Obama in 2008.
When I finish the patient's judgments tonight and I go to bed, the book returns me to the time that the politics inspired millions of people and your expressions took your breath.
The elections ended with a violent advantage, and television reporting forced us to think about the historic value of this moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents hid the newspapers they got.
A young team of visioners went to the White House, and the nation was ready to change.
During the entry into the Office in 2008, Obama had 82 per cent of its support.
And I'm closing the book here.
Going to the present is a rough awake, like waking up from sleep.
It's hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
In years after I put my first election ticket, there really have been changes.
It was definitely nothing I imagined.
I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a variety of great and diversity successes – from the law on accessible care through the departure of our armies from Iraq and the end of the policy "no to ask, not to say anything" after the death of Usama bin Ladin.
Furthermore, I am convinced that the side obstructions have reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: it is an immigration reform, the possibility of the public to choose health care and close the base in Guantanam.
But after many situations, when I defended Obam's administration against my colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit for explanations that they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political hopelessness.
The obstructions of the Republicans cannot explain the consent to listening to foreign leaders or to the attacks of droneless aircraft that kill innocent children in the sea.
It cannot be explained to them that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of the Americans, or that it is persecuting those who will disclose the wrong actions of the government.
They cannot be made responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a proper court or for restricting public contributions and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
They cannot be justified by finding a report that says that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are "neaggressive... than Nikson's administration".
And they can't apologize for the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the law on availability of simplified websites.
I don't know if something like that could be expected.
Should I have thought when I was 18 years old that the government's power could be in contrast with the political campaigns that preceding it?
The chosen function obviously has no predictable progress and our public talks will form a opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples that I have mentioned above appear largely as a result of my own administrative decision.
And that's what I'm most troubled.
I voted to both again in 2012, but not because I was excited of his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confused and unbroken alternative, and it seemed that he couldn't strengthen his policy or position.
I felt that the second functioning period for Obama, free from the pressure of the next elections, would fill the hopes we've heard of.
Nevertheless, the return to 2008 – how Obama's support has fallen below 45% this week – through this book is increasingly difficult.
They make me remember the number of promises that have been lost.
This week, I read the chapter in the book about Obama suffering a rude defeat with Clinton in Pennsylvania.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the pace and remain faithful to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The thoughts expressed in this comment are exclusively the views of Nathaniele Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that the President of the Government of Tony Abbott is in conflict with interests due to the parental vacation programme
Miliarder and messenger Clive Palmer says that the President of the Government of Tony Abbott is in conflict of interests due to the parental vacation programme, because his daughters can become pregnant and pregnancy.
The Banja Magnat, which leads a dispute due to the refund of the carbon tax dimension, amounting to $6 million, made this claim when he tried to remove the table the question of whether there was a conflict of interest.
Palmer's Joint Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a key role in deciding whether taxes from carbon and gravity are to be collected.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, and added that Abbott's daughters were in a position where they could benefit from this policy.
"He got into a great conflict of interests in paying parental vacation, because if any of his daughters were pregnant, he would have direct interest in whether she would have a parental vacation," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the elections, the electoral committee officially declared Mr. Palmer as a winner in the fight for the Fairfax District in Sunshine Coast, thanks to 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for an examination of the electoral results to accelerate the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closure of the electoral rooms?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come, put details into the computer, vote immediately and have results at half seventh night?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark voting tickets.
The point is that the results can be shummed if someone doesn't like it?
In these days and at this time, the use of pencils seems unbelievable.
The Electoral Commission studied electronic vote options and recently issued a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer (59) said that his political programme applies also to Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new job "very seriously".
The public office is a public service.
"We do not strive for any reward but we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Are you washing your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands is changing you and the nature.
The experiment was attended by 98 persons divided into three groups.
The first two were to solve the unresolved role.
Of course, both failed.
But a group who failed to wash his arms had a much more optimistic impression than the one where her participants did not wash their hands.
Also, a group with washed hands did better in the next test than the other one.
Still, those who washed their hands were targeted in other tests worse than those who had not washed them.
The results of the "laundered" were at the third group level whose participants did not notice any previous failure.
The results of the test show psychologists that physical cleanness really removes negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, motivations are declined, tests must be concentrated much more in other tests.
If we'd transferred the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we'd probably be the most optimistic when we returned from the toilet.
After the use of the WC, it is not only one percent of the Czech and Czech people, but it is a fifth of them on the road.
The hygiene also takes mostly after working in the garden or in the workshop when 85 percent of people wash their hands.
The swallowing of a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
The recent research revealed that there is a difference in the sense of the Czech and Slovak, as far as it is necessary to wash your hands after handing a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8% of the Czech Republic and 40.3% of the Slovakians are washing their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"If it was in place, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do something better," commented on the results of the skin doctor Claudia Komark.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two persons familiar with the situation, the Scotland Royal Bank (RBS) has suspended two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that the global investigation by the control authorities relating to suspected monetary machinery is increasingly frequent.
Some of the largest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with the competent authorities in the investigations of the world's largest financial market, where they change owners of 5.3 billion USDs every day.
The mention of two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended under an expansive investigation that will respond to the LIBOR scandal with the manipulation rate (London Interbank interest rate).
The Bank refused to comment, but confirmed that this month it received a request for information from the authorities.
"Our uncomfortable search in this matter continues, and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to this event pointed out that the RBS had transferred the British Financial Behaviour to the British Authority the records of e-mails and rapid accounts sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to be released from his current position of the European President of trade with foreign currency in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European President of the Fine Money Trade in Citi, entered a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former leader for exchanges in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were accused of any offence.
Mr. Usher's group for sending rapid news were bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people dedicated to this event.
The UBS bank expressed this week that, after the Swiss control body Finma announced that he investigated suspicious machinery on the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, it has taken steps against some of its employees.
The European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Antimonopoly Office of Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the United States and the Banking Authority in Hong Kong – is investigating the claim that these bankers have joined them to move with the monetary market.
In addition, the people of the familiar situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have launched an internal investigation or have received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are searching for years of old rapid news and e-mails to find cases of offences.
The investigation reports alarmed traders in the area, which was one of the largest engines for the production of profits in the end of the investment banks in the past years, but which was disturbed by a small currency limited the opportunities for speculants.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the severity of the situation when they claim that with a large and high liquid market with foreign currency, it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high positions of traders say that this must not be true.
The highly built trader said that despite a significant volume of daily trade with foreign currency liquidity liquidity between various commercial platforms and banks increasing their own internal platforms, "you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The report arrived on the same day when the Credit Suisse announced that this week she released her trade department for the trade of a trader, which at the end of last year caused loss of nearly 6 million USD.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperates with their control authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader was acting on his own and that this problem was solved," the Credit Suiss said.
The number of HIV infected in Prague exceeded a thousand
The doctors in Prague have recorded more than a thousand people with HIV.
Since the beginning of the 1986 tracking to the end of the third quarter, the tests confirmed the disease in total of 1005 people from metropol.
This comes from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the National Health Institute.
According to it, 2 063 infected were still in the entire CRC.
396 immunity failure has already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of infected in Czech Republic in the last decade is increasing annually.
In 2002, the tests confirmed the infection of 50 people, five years later they were 121.
In 2009, the investigation revealed 156 new diseases and then 180 in 2010.
The throats dropped to 153, last year, but the contrary was recorded.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"The total number of newly diagnosed cases this year exceeds 200, I think there is no doubt," the expert on AIDS Miroslav Headaty, who has been leading the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed infections in 39 people and last year in 47, said Headata.
In September, the doctors recorded 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the tracking to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has broken in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Whoever really wants to know a city should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk starting in a centre with memories, churches and galleries, more than a bedecre would betray.
Many people read the graves.
The cemetery are slowly floating and gaining an intimate view of local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationality, what faiths are, how big and cohesive families belong to, how old they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were for them.
How they express their social position, what they taste.
And from the state of the graves, they also find out how they care about their dead.
The Supreme Court has supported Obam’s Healthcare Act
The Supreme Court in the United States decided that the Healthcare Act signed by Barak Obama is in accordance with the Constitution, which is essential victory for Obama's administration.
With regard to the vote 5:4, the Court decided that the individual legislation of the Patient Protection Act and the Availability of Care — which it orders citizens to buy health insurance by 2014, otherwise threatens them to pay the penalty – does not resist the constitution on the basis of government tax power.
The President of the Court, John Roberts, stood on the side of four liberalised members of the court, while judges of Scalius, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court has also supported the remaining part of the law on 2700 pages and further decided that the legal requirement for health care, which states orders to extend the possibility of acquisition of hospital insurance, otherwise the risk of eliminating all the financing of the disease insurance from federal resources, is not compulsory and in contrast with the Constitution.
A complaint was filed by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises in order to block this law.
During the primary period in 2012, the law was closely rejected by each of the main Republican candidates, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
The words "Mugabe is a cold asshole" are no longer in danger of prison, the court has cancelled the law.
Until now, the Zimbabwani had to take good care of the public talking about the nine - eighty - year - old Mugab, who rules the country since the early 80s, then stands in her head since the end of 1987.
According to paragraph 33 of the Criminal Law, for disrespecting the presidential office, the penalty was threatened by $100 to one year of deprivation of freedom.
"State representatives should not be zealously accused of people who comment on the president in the houses or in other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
The government is likely to renounce the decision of the court, informed the British BBC.
A number of damaged Zimbabwans, among them Tendai Danga, whom the police arrested two years ago for the alleged insult of the president at a bar fight with a police officer.
In May, an opposition activist in the public of Mugabe ended up in prison with a "cuffy asshole".
In August then, the prosecutor accused a sixteen - year - old man for his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as a toilet paper.
The Court has also declared a constitutional law limiting freedom of media.
"The stand cannot punish people whose statements later appear to be false," the Deputy Minister of Justice, Luke Malal, said.
Until now, the Zimbabwe law has allowed the person who publishs false information to be sentenced to 20 years of prisoner.
"The existence of a law that allows criminalizing someone for a false declaration has a freely freely affected the right to express itself," Malala added.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with hard hands for over 33 years, he has adopted a new constitution with wider civil freedoms in March Zimbabwe on the basis of a referendum.
A tiny step from a man's dictatorship came in 2009, when the agreement between Mugab and the opposition took place in the premier chair of Morgan Tsvangira.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the highest inflation in the world that has exceeded 100,000 per cent.
Therefore, in 2009, the government totally canceled the national currency.
Today, Zimbabwe is only paid by currencies of other countries.
The explored economy is going to Mugabe's top of unreasonable agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redeployed the land of white farmers among his favorites and war veterans.
However, most of them had no experience with farming.
Central banks keep swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the Central Banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to allow banks to access global currency whenever they need.
The banks stated it in their joint declaration.
"It is a very reasonable step," commented Julian Callow, the main international economy of the London Bank Barclays.
"Meanwhile, all the transitional tools of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not in my opinion any surprise," added Vojciech Benda, the main economy of BH Securities.
Central bankers reinforce the bonds that began to form in 2007 when the international credit market first dripped.
The central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of central bankers comes when the US Fed is preparing for the end of its programme of support of the US economy, which could expel the cost of money on the global market even higher.
The Swap Contract is standardly used to overcome the lack of liquidity of one currency at the current excess of the liquidity of the second currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and the loan of the second currency.
The ECB starts a third attempt to return confidence to the European banks.
The EU agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport (no) removes personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on Tipsport.cz.
But I didn't finish this afterward, because someone who couldn't finish the online registration was sitting on the branch.
And since I didn't want to ride to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved, and that changed my address and the civil license number.
When I wanted the registration to be completed later, I was told that I can't do it because I have another OP number, an address, and that I can't just finish it and that I should ask for the deleting of the data and make a new registration.
I have therefore done so and 24.10.2013 I have written on technical support that I ask for the erasing of all my personal data from the database under the valid personal data protection law.
That's a funny day, technical support has written me that I have the registration to finish at the branch office.
This led to the maraton of e-mails for technical support, where after the fourth urgent 25.10 they wrote that personal data were deleted on my request.
So a person would say that he could perform the new registration and here the problems started again first, it wrote to me that my user's name was already enrolled (the understanding was not deleted - it's not about personal data, but they finally removed this).
So I used a different user name and it exploded at me that my personal data have already been stored to complete the registration of the branch (how may they have stored something that they claimed to be deleted?), so I contacted again technical support.
On my question how possible they wrote to me that they really deleted 25.10. and that I would send an e-mail with the error.
I did that (as yesterday about 15 hours) and I was told today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that that is why I could not, because I used the same name and date of birth.
What if I've been contacting technical support for a week and I'm dealing with them that it's not still possible.
And what about that if it was true what it claimed (if not) no one with the same name or date of birth could be registered if this is already registered.
By the way, in those 13.22, I really registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used the imaginary e-mail and the phone number and the world of wonder, the page appeared to me that they sent me an email link to the end of the registration.
But how is this possible if you cannot register the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport connects the registration to an e-mail and phone number and data just didn't exclude as he claims.
So I've reiterated this with technical support that they're just lying (be deliberately or not knowing what they write), because what they write is not true.
I've reported several screens that the registration problem has already been before 31.10. So "false" registration doesn't just affect this.
Tipsport answered me a strict sentence - I'm sorry, but by being registered again, we can't check your claims.
And he terminated the communication.
Respect repeats the same sentence that the registration shall be regarded to the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail, and so it did not actually run.
So if I summarize it, Tipsport is not just that he did not delete the data as he claims, but still lies when he claims the opposite.
The worse is that it can easily prove how they lie and try to make it look like a mistake is on the side of the customer.
By the way, after the introduction of this issue on my personal blog, things have been made a bit of a move, and from Technical Assistance arrives an e-mail that the issue is transmitted to verification and I will be informed (after a week of urgents and guessing and warnings of the same error).
Music plays in the metro on the Bridge
The Transport Company, pp. (DPP) Pragues launched the project Music in the subway.
The first newsbull, where the metro is continuously playing a reproduced instrumental music during the operation, is the Bridge of line A at the output to the Václava Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horáček presented his new double, band and three singers
The textary Michal Horáček brought to the collinian City Social House not only its entirely new twoCD Czech calendar, but especially in the show between us singers Lenka Nova, Františka Segrada and Ondra Rumla, accompanied by the excellent Matheya Benk Orchestra.
After the introduction intru and the actress of the late musician, he gradually invited Michal Horacek to the stage all three singers, himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded him of the last story they played in the Kolena and in the theatre and the whole city, and the electric current fell.
"In other ways, two types of cards were made in the Cologne," he recalled.
He also reminded the cousin of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could make a tour at the Battles or the Dubravac at Bratislava," he jokes about the parents of the other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horacek, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical act.
The calendar also made Joseph Manes, who put it on the eagle, about the ice hockey, but then he had no idea how we meet in those squares and scandal on who doesn't jump is not the Czech Republic.
That's the name of a Czech calendar song, but we're not playing here today," he laughed.
Ondra Ruml, however, was singing for him a lot of suitable sleep in the day, singing at night and accompanied him on a guitar.
Otherwise, if he wasn't singing, he played a pearl, all three singers then accompanied a band in a key, violoncello, guitar and contrabas.
All three vocalists sing a bit of a singing to the side of the heart, which immediately broke out the perspective.
"I'm glad that the song took you up, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's city," then Michal Horakek responded.
After the memory of Peter Hapka, I recognized in the application of France Segrad, originally rewarded by Richard Müller, Hannah Heger again recalled the music of Dad, Lyda Baar and the Hot Explanation of the Communist Prohibition and the replacement of Baar's American actress Mae West.
The composer of Michael Kocab once again reminded the Sebastian song, Segrado then sang the beautiful song of Prague with the jard Freedom, the sad family and the former Kolínjak.
But that was already the conclusion, the applause in standing and an additive in the form of a optimistic song We live in a wonderful time.
There was another appendix on the playlist, but the fans haven't flattered.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four seated behind the table to sign not only the Czech calendar but also the older CD, Michal Horacek, and even the packaging of the legendary LP, and with any interesters, even photographed.
Berdich will fill Rosol and Hayek with Stephanka
At the final of Davis' cup against Serbia, the non-playing captain of Czech tennis Jaroslav returned to the squarers Tomasz Berdich, Radek Štepanec, Lukas Rosol, Jan Hajek.
Czech trophy representatives are defending, but they are going to play the contest field to the Belgrade Arena, where the match will be performed on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs have been third in the last five years.
"We know we're going to a hot ground, that it's wild, and we must always focus on our performance."
"We will go there with the only goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Stephanie, the winner of the winning point in last final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama, how to bomb Syria.
American command in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis showed exactly how Syria would be bombed.
Without useless humbuk, threats and millions of statements, the aircraft have been sent, they hit the target and returned.
Without letting them collapse by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They're refusing to confirm the whole action, and they're not saying it anymore.
Precise contrary to confused and huge, unsupported acts of Syrian politics.
And the most satisfactory in all the attack was what the Israelites bombed.
Don't let the media confused by their claims that the "Syrian base" or "supplies for Hizbalah" was bombed.
I've recently written here that while the United States assistance to secular rebels in the country remains only on the rhetorical line, Russia continues to deliver the weapons of Syria.
And the fresh delivery of Russian missiles exhibited in the port Latakia became the target of Israel's attack.
Certain message.
And note, Israel has bombed Assad's regime again, not the rebel, even though it should be the opposite according to popular Internet theory.
The American government has awarded two members of spatial units, probably Delta force.
They haven't had any idea that they were marked during the attack on an American consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the ClA area in the city, I think it was members of the ClA secret command, which was formed by former soldiers.
It has speculated for a long time what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even in the other placed CIA residence.
Now it's clearer.
Anyway, information that the ClA has its offices protected by bullet nests in Libya (the law on one such one, both SEALs have died after a minomet) is relatively surprised.
But even more surprising are the information about these two unknown heroes.
These were parts of the American Command in Tripolis, and once they received an assault report in Benghaz, they volunteered to invade, and together with five private contractors, they shot their way to the ClA area in Bengaz.
Obama's administration is blamed by the fact that during that attack it wasn't officially and entirely put on the command, and it was just hesitating what to do.
Commander, without orders, apparently will release these volunteers.
Anyway, the fact that the country does not act singlely, but the permanent American command, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting.
And that's because nothing has been officially recognised until recently, and even now, there's only some NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it's good that the U.S. even though half trying to screw terrorism in Libya.
Even if it would be much more helpful to solve the national situation.
The last place of a secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It's not so long ago that the media almost singed the Iranian air forces for pursuing American drones.
But it is not known how the Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if it happens to be able to appear its drone in the airspace, there's nothing to do with it.
However, if the Iranian drones are discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
So it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom plane was pursuing an American drone in the international space above the sea, where maybe the first sharp placement of the American Super Raptor F-22 in history.
He went down to Phantom to optically check his weapons without being registered by Phantom on the radar or just noticed him, and then, suddenly, when he showed up with him and called the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened to him without repetition.
There's nothing to be surprised when Phantom is a plane of American production, but remembers the war in Vietnam.
It can't be compared to Raptor.
We want to show that Plyzze can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of paradox.
While his team has failed mostly lately, Victoria's defender or booker Plzenj František Rajtoral has a form that has brought him back to the representative after a year.
He also managed with arrows, heavily activated, and after his operation, he was ordered a punishment cop in the Teplicas.
Victoria touched in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplica after the win, but eventually she took one point from these two duels.
Francesque Raitoral believes his team will break an unpleasant series in the fight with Jablonce.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that the Jablonec will be defeated at home," Francis Reitoral promises.
The man is carefully preparing for the severe match with the Northern Cheches who play the attack football.
It's all aimed at struggling with Jablonce, the coach is preparing us well, as we always draw a lot from the video discussion of the game of the rival.
"I believe that this will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech fan represents the Tribunals of Doosan Arena.
The last matches didn't go as she wished, but Victoria refuses the word of the defense crisis.
So it goes in football, sometimes you have a good shape, and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any case.
"I believe we win on Friday, and it's gonna be good again," the Western Defensemen think.
Victoria's men will rely on supporting fans.
"He's playing on Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans that are great."
"I believe we will pay them the victory," Reitoral adds.
Jana Fifth: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I'm thinking about it, it's not really a step, it's actually a big jump -- a few years ago, and it's to memories, to my childhood.
It's memories of what it was like, don't worry about it and just come out of school and wash the dishes, exhaustion and do tasks.
Even though these "obligations", it was mostly a theory, the desire of parents.
Praxe was completely different - to run out of school, throw a bag into the corner and run out.
Playing games with other kids, jumping a drink.
Then, at Helena's series, and her boys, they're sewing a brick-up for Grandma's birthday.
And then after a few warnings, to wash the dishes finally, to explode, in winter to put wood into the tiles stone and to do tasks until after the darkness of the lamp (or to rely on a classmate and instead of the tasks to write in loved verses addressed to school love).
In the morning to have a homemade strawberry (from the true fruit, not the mosques that are now sold, whose contents are not even lay) and to drink it with tea from dried plants that we so much liked to collect.
I also remember the magic nights when the grave silence was in the room, when we recorded the music songs from the radio to the tapes that went loud in an old mom's tape.
And then we turned those tapes on the pencil and kept playing the same song around, our favorite, and they were drinking with a siephon.
Or we phoned over the table through the pillows that were tied to each other - and when we were on the phone call to hear better, we needed to clean ears thoroughly, then the squirrel was a syringe plus vata.
The minimum pay was more than three times lower than now, and my parents were able to live out of it so we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPady even phones and laptops or tag clothes.
The clothing was inherited from a generation to generation and the best "produce" in the closet was a baticated domestic production shirt using SAVA.
From electronics, we had enough to satisfy the mom's tape and mostly Walkman that we shared with our sister and, by the way, only used in the school trip train.
We came more interesting to play with Aunt Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I've already made "only" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, surely their parents saved it for a long time, but unfortunately he was not warm up in our house for a long time.
My younger sister screwed a scratch into him, he said he papped those tapes so beautifully, so she tried if he could screw up.
Unfortunately, it was his last part.
Well, he's got this event today, poor guy, on his dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was little, she screwed a slide into the video and thought she'd play the recipe and didn't win, so she can't burn it today.
I remember how we were able to communicate together, make a deal without a phone, a computer.
Together with my sister at Grandma's holidays, we arranged with our granddaughter's neighbour, when we met again next year in the summer at Grandmas - and that was what it was.
We're together.
Do you promise to see someone in a year?
I also remember the winter when we ran out with the entire village, building snowflakes, riding on a snowy climb near the church on the bags of shadow.
Then I and my family had dinner and talked about the last day.
Of course, we listened to our sister before every dinner, the notoriously famous sentence, "Well your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but surely you don't have sauce tied in the limonet grid in the bathroom.
After dinner, when my dad worked in the garage at the beer with Yarda from the village, we lied on the floor with my mom, washed our legs on the tissue stones, opened the doors and watched the flame and listened to the blowing of wood that linuated from the stone.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together -- we talked -- we didn't write messages every day through different chambers, texts.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew more about each other.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It's lovely to remember, especially if I supplement these memories by seeing an album where black corners are treated with black white photos.
And if I hadn't known how old I was then, the painting's always been written in the back of the picture.
I'm looking at that, even though the cuts under the cocktail weren't very good for us, and we also had cousin's pants by two numbers larger, no one used to laugh at us before, it was so normal (not in).
And I'd rather go back on that step forward - to reality.
Until 2013, I will wait for what the modern times will make up for my children once.
What I know is that these memories are now for a young adolescent generation, so at least some "a hundred years behind monkeys" and I think they're losing a lot of the time they don't get this "pre-pipe" too.
I'd wish them!
Google, Samsung and Huawei are sued for Nortel's patents
The group, owning thousands of patents of the missing company Nortel, filed a complaint on Thursday for breach of the patent against the manufacturers of mobile phones, including the Google company, which it revoked in auction within the bankruptcy of Nortel.
The Rockstar Consortion, which purchased Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, sued the US District Court in Texas Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for the violation of the patent.
The Rockstar is shared with Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of a violation of seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps connect the terms searched on the Internet with the relevant advertising, the complaint states the core of Google search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not to be invaded immediately.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that operate on the Google Android operating system, which is strongly competitive for the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google made a default price offer for Nortel's patents of $900 million.
Google has increased his offer several times and finally offered up to $4.4 billion.
Once Nortel was defeated by Rockstar's Patents, Google won for 12.5 billion USD Motorola Mobility, which was a trade motivated partially by a group of patents of Motorola.
"Despite failure in trying to auction patents that are subject to the dispute, Google has violated and continues to breach," the complaint states.
The Rockstar aims to increase the compensation for Google's damage, because it says that there is a violation of the patent by Google intently, as the lawsuit claims.
Miloslava Cejpk: November smile
She came outside, four degrees of Celsia, which we haven't used to.
First, she put her smile, the one who was still in the mood as a defense against a friendly environment.
It made her very relieved because it was a mask she decided not to put it in public.
He was honest at home only the days she had grandmother and grandchildren Elinka or Adieka around her.
And of course when her sons called.
She was very well remembered a lesson from infinite trade skills courses.
Now they're really good.
So she can't disturb her closest.
Then he flew to the corner.
It's like a masking dress.
November or another month can't do that miracle to smile really like when they were on a trip with one who hasn't been here for nearly three years.
Egypt introduces into the office of the first freely elected President
Muhammad Mursí made an inauguration oath, but his triumphable day just hardly ends political disturbances in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Mursi promised “new Egypt ” when the first freely elected president of this country was presented to the office, after Husnski Mubarak, who was settled 16 months earlier.
In his introduction to the Office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Murcia also became the first freely elected Islamic President in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of the State from the disposal of the monarchy approximately 60 years ago.
He oathed before 18 judges dressed in black tallers in a seat built with a view to the Nile, which reminds the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We strive for better tomorrows, new Egypt and the second republic," Mursi said at the celebrating ceremony transmitted live in state television.
“The Egyptian people today have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which has been targeted by a sharp attack of individual governments for most of 84 years of its creation as an illegal organization.
When Mursi arrived in a small collon of cars shortly after 11 hours of local time, they guarded the building of hundreds of soldiers and cops.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the court building to celebrate the president, and, unlike the presidential performance of Mubarak's period, the transport was only shortly stopped so that the colony could run a normal road to connect the city's center with the suburb in the south.
The Personal Prestige of Mursi, ridiculously referred to as a non-haristical “reserve tyres” of the Muslim brotherhood, has rapidly grown since his victory and his Friday speech, aimed at presenting him not only as a candidate of Islamists but also all those who want to bring the end of the rebellion against the authoritary Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi said, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie of judges in a wooden cotton, where he oathed.
Mursi later traveled to the University of Cahir, where he had to speak inauguration.
While he was attentive, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national hymna.
Attendant was the military commander of the field marshal Hussein Tantawi.
His arrival was accompanied by the scandal of “arms and people are one hand ” of the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture Hall of the university.
The university in Kahir was founded in 1908 as a centre of secular education and later in the 1970s became the garden of Islamic student movements.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday at the Tahrír Square, where the revolution was born, which last year ended the authoritarian government of Mubarak, and promised to reap the presidential powers taken by his office by the military council, which took it from the deprived leader.
But by agreeing to make an official oath before the court, rather than before the parliament, as usual, he subjected the will of the army, which suggests that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech in the Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populistic gestures.
There's probably gonna be police specialists in the ghetts. They're supposed to lighten the tension.
In the ghettes in Czech Republic, police specialists should be involved in the future.
They'd spend half of their business here.
They'd be watching the order and dealing with problems.
With their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from the poor places and the people in the area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of Interior counts on it.
He believes that the country's situation would be most helpful to "accelerate social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were some 300 poor homes and quarters in Czech Republic a few years ago.
They lived with 80,000 people, especially Romas.
Adults in ghettes were unemployed, families were dependent on dosages, children ended up in "special" schools.
It's a liquor.
According to the experts of the problem locations, a hundred has arrived at the time.
The relationship between their inhabitants and others is sharp.
In several places, anti-romic marches took place.
The extremists were joined by people in the neighborhood.
According to the inside, the police are difficult in the areas with the ghetta security and order to maintain.
The basic condition is said "continuous application of equal approach in the exercise of law".
But it's not possible to achieve this without a detailed knowledge of the place and people.
The specialist would go to a ghett meeting where he would spend half of his service, the rest would serve in his area.
He'd be watching the order in a troubled place.
He would also know the local, so he could deal better with problems or offences.
"Thanking the trusted experts will be easier to prevent a number of illegal negotiations," stated the inside.
Specialists in ghettes would receive supplements, 500 to 1000 crowns a month.
The introduction of special police officers into the challenged areas should be compromised by Norwegian funds.
The budget is approximately 600,000 euros (now approximately 15.5 million crowns).
Czech Republic pays 15 per cent of the sum, funds 85 per cent.
Preparations started this year, now a detailed proposal is being processed.
The project shall take place until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied to Slovakia for several years, where the socially excluded areas are incomparablely higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements," reports authors said.
How many specialists should be in Czech Republic, it's not clear yet.
An answer should be given by an analysis that determines where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also matter how much money for these members will be able to release the police each year after the project is completed.
According to the project's proposal, the police first graduate in Slovakia.
This training should take five dozens of members annually.
They'll be the most appropriate candidates.
There should also be special education for policemen who will work in ghetts.
According to the authors, the improvement of the situation would help mostly social living.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the inventory, there would be three categories.
The minimum standard would meet accommodation facilities with precisely defined rules, such as the number of persons per room.
The medium standard would be in small places.
The higher standard would have social apartments that would be comparable to normal housing.
The mercenaries would have to implement the integration plan that social workers would build with them.
They would have to follow the accommodation order, take care of their health, send children to school, requalify and actively seek jobs.
If they were trying to integrate, they would proceed to a higher standard of living.
The progressive housing system should work within at least 30 years until another generation grows "in the integrated environment".
Social housing models are preparing resorts for local development and work.
They're going to propose it by the end of the year.
Karel Drabek: Carbon top is one of our youngest soups.
The carbon top is an illustration of 3 km southeast of Bruntal.
Together with several other, the evidence of the juvenile activity in the low Jesenique is recently reported in the geological terms of time.
The last eruption was here at the beginning of fourth Mountains.
When looking from a greater distance, at the top of the Carbon Top, there is an impressive white baroque passing church of Virgin Marie Help, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden chapel.
The host who stood next to the church didn't behave.
Shortly after the church was completed, the alley was planted from four lines of lips, a length of about one mile.
The crossway on the Mountain of Carbon is already a third version, originally standing here after 1916, second, from 2001 only until 2004.
At 15 stops, there are wooden plastics made by the local artist cutter František Nedomlel.
He used different types of wood from the Low Lake area.
Similarly, the ponds of the mountains from this area form an interesting geological exposation.
The name of the sponsor is also indicated at each stop.
The carbon top is the rest of the young hull.
Although data from radiometric measurement ages are a little different, the last eruption was here about 1,5 million years ago.
He is, therefore, younger than the Big Road (a age of 3.3 million years) and older than Venus’s vulture (are 0.8 million years old).
The vulture was born by an explosion.
She threw a significant quantity of soup ashes along with the fractions of mines from the floors that burned the red brown color.
At the end of this stage, the lion came up on the surface - today it is a layer of a poor seed up to 13 meters.
The second eruption threw red, brown and places to black tuffs.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters, and its part is accessible in the wall of the break.
In the tubes there are impressive soup pums large to 1 meter. Even the second eruption was finished with the exhaust of the lava.
At the end of the work of the vulture, a lion, which today forms a powerful layer of a turbulence.
Sulphurs that are the most common type of sope.
Because they're actually composed of layers, they got the name of the stratovulkana.
The original sophisticated sculpture was gradually erosed.
However, he was threatened by a severe mountain in a lome on the south side.
The most intense harvest was held in 1953 - 1962.
The tuffs joined the concrete, which was then easier and had better heat insulation properties.
The exercise was successful under the pressure of experts and the public to stop and maintain this unique place.
The problem is, however, in the persistentness and small cohesion of the mountains that rapidly wind, fall apart and move down the hill.
The lome is going pretty fast.
In order to make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-oriented scroll is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
So the fixing is a problem, but in time it will be necessary to choose and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important places.
You'll get to the Carbon Tourism Tourists from Bruntal, if possible from Slezsky Kočov.
Automobilists can use unpaid parking at the beginning of the lip alley, where a short learning path begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a queen villa with a garden and a pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa quarters in Orechovka.
The original owners of the house, however, gained it back in the restitution, and the tenants had to move away with a small retreat.
That is why Ivana quickly searched for a replacement for herself and her older mom then.
She received a tip from her accommodation for the apartment 3 + kk in the older panel house on the other side of Prague.
"It was a shock at first, but the look from the fourth floor to the large woods and the barrier inspired me on the other side," Ivan recalls the first impression.
First I thought it would be a provision for three years.
"We live here for more than thirteen years today and not only because of a gradual reconstruction, I would not change," the owner adds.
Mother and daughter then moved from a 100-mm apartment to a smaller area of 62 m2 and distributed all equipment.
The action was not easy, things were stored in friends and progressive arrangements took almost a year.
The new apartment was in a totally good condition, but the necessary adjustments, such as the lactation of doors or the exchange of windows, had to take place.
The previous owner broke down the core, but the owner was the most distracted inadequately resolved and unnecessarily large predecessor, and on the contrary a small bathroom.
A multifunctional housing area formed by connecting two rooms.
The architects used to define individual zones and the sharing of the seadrocardone room, which allowed a new location of lights.
The first struggle to which she decided after a few years was the removal of the spray in the living room.
Although the apartment has changed its position to 2 + kk, the room has gained air and the panoramic view of the surrounding green.
The next step to the partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the floor from PVC for laminate.
You didn't know Ivan with the bathroom.
I've been taking magazines about living for years and looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
So I addressed a young architect Kamila Doudar to the recommendation.
"It was actually the most important step to the future," says Ivana.
By restructuring the bathroom, it was also possible to modify the seats available.
The architect connected the bathroom and the bathroom and two doors with open wings replaced with one slider, saveing the place.
The bathroom is overtime and also sufficiently barrier.
Quality covers imitate the sand, also a comfortable seat in the shower, a bidet shower.
Successful collaboration with Camilo Doudar continued.
In the context of the series How the dream was constructed, a rapid but essential change in the living room, which was also part of an architect Martin Čenek.
In the area that formed by connecting two small rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping without helping with the classic principles of optical division, acquisition by half-proofs or Japanese walls.
"It would result in a breach of openness and unity of the space," explains the architect.
It was originally able to separate the bed and the living part.
It was only to turn the backs of two coffins and to build a box for feathers in peace.
The dining corners define the shadows of the floor and paintings.
The architect of the quality marmoleum used on the floor in the kitchen and a dining corner, and the sliding door was restored with a wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchen angle shall, if necessary, cover the sliding panels with the wallpaper.
A new floor from an anti-allergic marmole has a series of advantages from the laminate: a soft slippery surface without a spark and a better sound isolation.
The system of bullets and previews from the carton highlighted by the color is an indication of how you can work with space in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects. I wish it was joyful.
"I like orange, I have the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
The graphoschlore with the motive of blossom magnolia is practical and creates a significant estetic element.
For a warm energy tone, the architects chose a white, which underlined a modern functional style.
In a small apartment, books were stored, inter alia, in the space under the window parcel.
Everything's on the reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled on the distance.
In the processed interior, the contrast of the new one with the elder, for example, with tens of years of old crystal mirror and with quality art objects that Ivana gathers all his life.
The last one came in the kitchen.
The boxes were used to be placed on both sides, and the owner felt like a little in the tunnel.
The architect took their number and translated the location.
The furniture in a simple design is made for a procurement, the white surface slightly reinforces the pearl surface.
In the small space, the washing, dryer, and washing machine came into the idea.
The look of the small kitchen restored the whole glass of walls above the workboard.
The unique graphoscole with a digitally printed motive is attractive and is also well maintained.
Ivana chose flowers of magnolia that remind her of the favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now it seems that she's happy here.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and a washing machine, the new owner chose a neutral shade of the cover.
A big shower corner has a glass door of Ronal.
The task was to create a clear simple space from the environment in which the functions and devices will be harmonised.
Inside we united materially and colorfully and tried for its elegant, convenient, not too full of appearance.
"A further condition was a barrier solution with minimal obstacles and possibilities for easy movement around the furniture and the achievement of the items of the daily need," Camila Doudzir adds.
The Supreme Court decided: Sometimes you can pursue.
The Supreme Court decided that the former Prime Minister Petra Time may also be pursued for any criminal acts that could have been committed before the August Resolution of the House of Ambassador.
It was protected only by the process immunity that applies to the statements in the House.
In the case of former Members of ODS Ivan Fuxy, Mark Schnaidra and Peter Tluchor, he decided that they could not be punished for any criminal acts until they renounced the messenger's mandate in November last year, Peter Knötig spokesman of the Supreme Court.
The Court of Justice rejected the proposal of the State Representative Iva Istnjak, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the Members.
He said they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state firms for giving up their mandate and not making problems with the approval of laws.
On the contrary, a former prime minister who offered these posts can be pursued.
With Vit Barta, an officer of the anti-corruption police has also been arrested.
Bart's defender, Oldrich Poor, who represented him even in the cause of the alleged corruption of VV Members, was also not to express too much, but he said, "Yes, I represent the client in this matter, but I cannot further comment with the protection of secret facts."
According to information, the case is dealt with the General Inspection of Security Assemblys (GIBS).
Server tn.cz said that Bart could buy secret information from the police.
According to the first-to-face server, the case could have been linked to the cause of the former police president Peter Lessy, whose appointment was allegedly aimed at Bart's function.
The latest information of the Law, however, shows that detention of Vita Barta is not related to Peter Lessi.
The speaker of the police presidency, Eva Kropačová, refused to comment on the case of the Prague city representation.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of the secret facts," the spokesman of the City's State Representativeship in Prague, Stephanka Zenklová, said on Friday.
The applicant of Bart is now supervising the matter, and indirectly it shows that the record or criminal proceedings are conducted in the secretary regime.
The reporter Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vita Barta Katerina Classna in the morning before their residence in Prague Clare.
She was just putting her baggages in the car and leaving.
She refused to speak to the whole event.
On Friday morning, Bart's detention was expressed by the leader of the Mountain of Tomio Okamura.
According to his words, he has no idea what this is about.
"Viet Bart was one of the many candidates of many parties in our candidate, and as I repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of direct democracy of Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vietnam Barta, who in the past early elections to the House in the Plzen region, failed to run for the movement of the Dawn of direct democracy, Tomia Okamura, is known as his corrupt cause of repayment of Members of Public Affairs.
In April 2012 he was improperly convicted for 18 months with a 30-month delay.
Subsequently, the judgment was changed and Barta was released.
He slept: I want a NHL contract.
I still have a thirst, a desire
Propala was always the first place in the family, so she wants to be fully subjected at 38 years of age.
Either he gets a job out of the sea, and he's still extending his career, or he's definitely finished with hockey.
"I want to play the role of my dad and my husband."
"I'm looking forward to it," says a hockeyist who's still waiting for the offer.
Despite the fact that he's an announced employee who never screws up.
Despite the fact that he leaves his heart on the ice every time, and he can crush fellow players.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive Columbus player in the past season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still," he states determinedly.
Maybe he'll wait, allegedly New York Rangers who have failed to enter the season and have two injured resistances - the attackers of Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
How does your arrival look at Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on the paper, it's not worth dealing with it.
I know the article's out in the New York Post journal that they should sign me, but that's all.
Nowhere was added that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
Didn't even call you from the club?
Such communication in NHL takes place every day.
It's about getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When a player gets hurt or someone can't do it, and the manchaft doesn't.
There are a lot of different factors that have to meet together to get the contract.
But in New York, just similar circumstances happen, don't they?
The wounded is Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan and the team didn't get into the season, so there's some chance, don't you think?
Of course, the chance is always.
But the second thing is, you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got one yet.
Unfortunately, this is the reality I have to live in.
You fly to America on Friday, you're expecting something just to hit?
I have the expectations since July 5th when the NHL market opened with free players, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
No, of course not. I'm going to Tampa for the kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sun and to see you again.
Do you have any plans for your program?
It's given by being a father and a husband, and everything's going away from it.
I'm not a hockeyist right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to do my daddy and husband's role, and I'm looking forward to it.
Yours has two hockey games on Sunday, that's for me and my whole family on holidays when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in the full-time cartridges?
Of course, a person can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 fights for the knee surgery.
And it made me very and very enjoyable.
Once it gets into such a stage that all the goals, winning and extracts will not replace you with what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the purpose of life.
Whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could have met me except my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play NHL only because it's NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockeyist, first place - except for the family - belongs to sports success.
NHL is the best competition in the world.
And there's a family life coming from.
My children, then, excuse me, our children -- mine and my wives -- grew up in the United States, started going to school and so on.
And we'd be so happy if they continued in this trend.
Because what we're going to say, in America, the options are completely elsewhere.
That's the chance we should offer them.
So are you planning to stay in America forever?
We're going to practice it as we do so far.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic in the Deep and in the area of the Czech Budjajevic.
And in winter again in Tampa or where our steps will lead us.
It's perfect to be still warm.
I've had a lot of luck in my life.
It could be said that I went across, it cost a lot of strength and refusal, and it took me a lot of things I missed.
But the hockey offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where to live.
There's a lot of people in the world who want to choose what they're gonna do and how to live.
How long will you have the will of drowning, hard training and waiting for a offer in your age?
Yeah, that's the question I can't answer.
I still have this in me today, the juice, the desire, the excitement, the passion for the sport, the desire and the motivation to prove to the people that you still have on NHL that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell how long it's gonna stay there.
It can't be planned.
So you can say you'll wait for this season when it gets out and then you decide, what's next?
I'm in the stage when I go from day to day.
Recently, the Director-General of ČEZ announced that the construction decision on 3 and 4th of the Temelin power plant was deferred to the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified it by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and consenting the Contracts of Difference by the Government.
These are the reasons why the current leadership of the CEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government -- that is, for the major shareholder.
But the qualified manager should recommend to the shareholders, not to hide behind him.
Babish: Only the government with Saturday.
Andrej Babish is starting to reconcile that his movement ANO will not have time to teach political enemy in opposition and that he will have to go straight into the government to arise at all.
The President of ANO accepted this in an interview for the Law that will come out tomorrow.
Business and marketing ŠkoFINU leads Abrahamak
Its competence includes the field of product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He replaced the Human Shantor in his function.
Abrahamek has connected his professional career with the car sector for the last 14 years.
He worked in Toyota Motor Czech, subsequently in Fiat ChR, where he was responsible for seven years of marking and dealers Alpha Romeo.
His last job was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which over five years he was standing in the position of the car division manager.
SKOFIN was created in 1992.
The police evacuated part of the airport in Los Angeles because of the shooting.
At the international airport in Los Angeles, there was a shot in the morning.
This is why the police evacuated the portion of the airport, allegedly the terminal three.
Reuters' agency claims that the men of the law were shot by a gun of an armed man.
Los Angeles Times reported that there was a shooter who had been injured by two to three members of the Transport Security Department.
How many people have been hurt and whether there are any victims, but it's still not obvious.
Firemen talk about an event with a larger number of injured people.
CNN: Israel bombed the military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian missiles for Hizballah.
The Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base on Thursday near the Syrian port of Lataki.
By appealing to the unnamed American government actors, the CNN television announced it.
The Israeli press broadly informed the explosion in the alleged missile warehouse, but the Israeli government did not confirm it.
The speaker of the Israeli army on the CNN question refused to comment on the invasion.
"We do not express ourselves to the reports of foreign media," she said.
The target of the Israeli attack was according to the US government source of missile and related equipment, which, according to the Israelites, could be transported to the Libanon Military Movement of Hizbalah.
The AP Agency, appealing to another American security factor, informed that the target of the Israeli attack on the Syrian territory was the Russian missile SA-125.
The second channel of Israel’s television informed that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian system of opposite defence.
Satellite images of the attack area, but according to DPA, showed the battery of Russian missiles type S-125 Neva.
Furthermore, it is said that the SA-3 batteries were seen on them, including the command centre with a radar to monitor missiles and their targets.
The recorded rockets have a 35 - mile flight, according to the report of Israel’s television, and they could bear heads of a weight of 70 kilograms.
This year, at least twice, Israel bombed missiles in Syria, according to CNN and AP.
The Israeli army never responded to such reports, but repeatedly declared that it would affect any supply of weapons designed by Hizballah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Does the Internet mean the end of the travel agency?
Flight Centre seems to succeed in resisting this trend.
The company updated the annual profit estimate and expects record profits from recreators in Australia and Great Britain.
The travel office now expects its annual profits before taxation to be moved between 325 and 340 million USDs, compared to 305 to 315 million USDs from the previous forecast.
If the current development is maintained, it will be 12 to 17 per cent increase in record profits of 290.4 million USD from 2011/12.
General Director Graham Turner said that the Flight Centre created an 8 per cent profit in the first half of the year, and the second half of the year began with a rapid growth mainly in the Australian and British trip outside the service trip.
"For today's date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are targeting the record annual profits prior to interest and taxation," he said.
This belongs to Australia and Great Britain, which are traditionally our greatest creators of profit.
Recreational activities have been raised during the second half-year in Australia, compensating a slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in Great Britain, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
The American trade has recovered after the loss during the seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to bring a third in a series of year's profits.
The Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at 38.20 USD.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia have transferred to Petrograd
Ecoactive activists detained since September in Russia for the protest against the planned oil transfer in Arctic were transported from Murmansk to Petrohrad.
The AFP has informed this today with an appeal to the international ecological organization of Greenpeace.
At the same time, it claims that the original accusations of her piracy activists have not yet been withdrawn.
"Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that the thirty men and women held in Russia after a non-violent action against the oil platform in Arctic was transported from a removal device in Murmansk to a prison in Petrohrad," the organization announced in the statement.
The reasons for moving detained activists are not clear; according to the DPA Agency, it was a planned movement.
The ecological authorities first accused them of piracy, which threatened them to be sentenced for up to 15 years of prison.
But last week, they announced that this accusation would be replaced by a mild breakdown for which the lower punishment with the upper limit of seven years would be deprived of freedom.
But Greenpeace noted today that the guilt of piracy of the authorities had not yet withdrawn, as they promised.
They say that detention is now charged with two crimes.
The Potent Investigation Committee announced last week that the guilt for piracy would replace the charges with the injury.
But when 30 prisoners were standing before the committee this week, the guilt for piracy was not withdrawn.
Instead, a new accusation was filed against everyone," AFP quoted in Greenpeace's statement.
In the middle of September, the Russians held three dozens of Greenpeace members from 18 countries on the oil platform of Gazprom.
The ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise ship, floating under the Dutch flag.
Since then, all have been held in custody, against which they have filed a complaint, but the court has rejected them all.
The ecologist complains on the conditions of imprisonment.
The Executive Director of Greenpeace Kumi Naidoo, according to the AFP, stated today that moving to Petrohrad will make the meeting with the families and consular workers easier.
However, there is no guarantee that conditions in new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse," he warned.
The Netherlands King Willem-Alexandra asked for help, one of the detained activists Faiza Oulahsen.
In a manually written letter published today, Algemeen Dagblad called upon the monarch to talk about their situation at a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
It argues that Maliki has a great share in renewal of sectarial violence in Iraq, which is partly partly a part of the struggle in neighbouring Syria.
Schools should focus more on math, spell and grammar
At the time of English literature, at least one Shakespear game, a novel of the 19th century, a romantic poetry and the current British beletria since 1914.
The test will also include “the hidden text ” to motivate deeper reading;
Combined courses of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to have a graduate test of language and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue the new basics for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to pass radical change.
The changes are expected next year for other substantive subjects.
In a separate step, the Office of Ofqual, which observes the maturity tests, will reveal changes in the maturity test structure, along with a new marking system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his summer speech, the Minister of Education, Michael Gove, said that there is a “wide consensus in terms of whether we need to reform our test system to regain our trust in the company” and that it is necessary to insist that the maturity test is “with more difficult, more ambitious and strict. ”
Study shows that English schools spend less time mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours a week — than most other countries.
For comparison of school in Australia, mathematics are devoted to an average of 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
Although no official demand will devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have indicated that the extensive mathematical maturity test – together with a greater focus on this subject in the results - will probably encourage schools to provide additional studies.
The training plan will focus more on “the problems of the real world”, including financial mathematics.
Ostravski Primator Kajnar: Cancer in ČSSD I'm not me
Before the elections, a long-term dispute between the two wings fighting for the influence of the islandian ČSSD has been completely emerged.
It was all over by turning the Primary of Ostrava Peter Kainar into court for the non-democratic composition of candidates.
The causal actors, however, did not want to express themselves too much to make the party more harmful before the elections.
But now the voters' voices are compiled.
The leadership of the island ČSSD so immediately on Monday night called on the Primator of Ostrava to step out of the side, and apparently pushing to lose his function.
But Peter Kainar wants to fight on.
What the disputes are about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive conversation for the Danique.
How do you feel the result of the elections?
CSSD must have counted on much better results.
Has it been harmful with us to deal with media disputes within the party before the elections?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better choice result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the condition in which the CHSD is now.
It's a party who has its internal problems, she's internally sick and people feel that it's not all right.
They made it clear in the elections.
What are the internal diseases of ČSSD?
It's been a decline for a while, I think, the ODS has been passing through, and, unfortunately, these things are now in social democracy.
It's that lobbyists, influenced people who had previously expected to find their prebends at ODS, moved to people in the CHSSD and have an impact on them.
It's about going to the police and collecting computers on the island magistrate offices.
This shows that the CHSSD is not just composed of people who would like the good of all others, but many of them are mainly thinking about their own goods.
CSSD is divided into two unconditional camps in Prague, as it is seen in the current fight for power between Hashkovci and Sobotkovci.
But it's been preparing for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a prediction of what is going on now in Prague.
Hashkov’s wing gradually held its position so that after the elections it could cause a situation that weakens the wing of Sobota.
A person is in politics in a situation where sometimes he has to access compromises.
But everyone has some inner limits where the compromise are no longer going to do, and that's my case.
I originally didn't want to candidate to the House, but when I saw the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubosh Zaoralk that I would try to get to the district candidate to strengthen the Sobotk's wing as Primary of Ostrava.
Hashkov's wing, but it's got a stop.
Why are you standing on the side of Godslava Sobotka, not Michal Hask?
Praise Saturday is, I think, a person who always talks mainly about the CHSD programme and to a certain extent also about visions for the country and for this country.
I admit, on the other hand, I haven't heard anything like that.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how a presidency, which is a lower authority than a central executive committee, can only appeal to the President of the Party.
It's a struggle for power, regardless of everything and against the provisions of the party.
According to me, by what Michal Hašek showed in Prague now, he ended his political career.
How did you feel that the island leadership of the CHSSD didn't approve you for a candidate?
Political parties are based on the competition, who will be placed as part of their members.
The competition should mostly be based on the programming visions and on the ability of those people to fill these visions.
Of course, there are also people who have no power or vision, but the political party is an elevator to the money they would not get anywhere else.
The problem is, when these people start to get forward by violating the rules without scrutiny, they violate the provisions of the parties.
They're making their practices from the political parts of the mafia, and I think they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
Notifying this problem is more important to me than taking into account whether any Kainar has a political future.
It is important that the parties start respecting the provisions.
Therefore, have you filed a proposal before the elections to the court for preliminary measures against the form of the candidate of the ČSSD in the Morausles region?
The current district executive committee of ČSSD in Ostrava reinforces its power by revoking organisations that do not suit him, purposefully forming a new organization, gradually dismissing the uncomfortable members of the party.
The example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarik from the Deputy Club, but he filed a complaint against it, and they had rather cancelled the resolution of his exclusion.
This shows that pursuing compliance with the position of the party over the courts is the last option, but at the moment the other methods and control authorities inside the CSD have stopped working, it is the only option.
The effort to lead the islandian ČSSD leading Member Adam Rykala is to withdraw you from the position of the Primator.
It is a public secret that Mayor Lumir Palyza is familiar with this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumir Palyza are trying to do everything to make me call off.
They promise people positions, they get voices and then reinforce their power in the side.
When I get back in the past, everything that happened about Banik Ostrava's football club and buying Bazala stadium was just a reason for them to attack me.
It was artificially emphasized so that they could name me as a man who gives money where they don't belong.
However, the city bought a property that is strategicly valuable to him.
So how do you still see that with your endurance in the primator function?
The District Committee has already invited me and other people on Monday to consider our endurance in the ČSSD.
But I think it's like when the thief shouts, "Hold the thief!
When we look at the results of my work in the past 11 years, I don't see anyone in the island social democracy who would initiate and prosecute, sometimes even against the parties, there are so many development areas such as industrial zones or enlargement of the scientific and technological park.
Still, I'm getting uncomfortable.
I can't read it differently than interfering with the others to break into the places they want.
Are you going to fight these attempts any more?
Because if this Republic is to work well, political parties must also work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to drive the state effectively if he can't drive himself.
So I don't think I'd leave the CHSSD now, because I think the one who causes cancer of this side is not me, but those people who are trying to piss me off.
Olomouc opens in the historic center of the public slippery
The organizer of the Olomuic Christmas markets and the winter swimming, Paul Burned said that preparatory work on the cluster was launched on October 26th and since Wednesday there is an ice-production aggregate.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters strong and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The club has a surface of 375 square meters, the stage took 358 square meters.
The broadcasts and circuits will also have two stations with a punch.
"We expanded the floor area, increased the area in front of the stations, and almost the entire area of the podium is covered so that the bloggers could be comfortably renewed," he described.
Olomouce streets are already reminded of coming Christmas.
Last year, the slippery was installed in front of the main entrance of the city in the Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed on the slope of the summer, so the ice area could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could squeeze right in front of the Council in 2009, when the slippery was operational from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
The Christmas markets, which are part of the rich cultural programme, will be launched on the Upper Square a month before Christmas.

The brutal murder of the senior in Zlinska will re-have the district court
The District Court dismissed the charges of the fifty-five-year-old Slovak and the 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men refused the guilt.
They are in danger of 15 to 20 years of imprisonment or a special punishment.
Speaker Peter Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court of Justice cancelled the district decision and returned the matter.
The reasons led to that judge refused to comment that the decision has not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the prosecution, the young men were robbed by a seventeen - year - old man in his house.
Senior died by a creepy death.
According to the prosecution, his men were scratching, beating and digging all over his body, and also with a metal object, apparently a gas gun, put about three dozen wounds in his head.
A man suffered severe wounds, such as skull bone fractures, brain oysters, or bleeding to the brain to which he had fallen.
The young people reportedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewels worth about 14,000 crowns.
According to the district court, they were the only, in addition, the indirect evidence against the suspected smell traces, which the expert estimated as not entirely identified in the meaning of the legal guidelines.
The scents of the crime scene and other things, though in more than ten cases, were consistent with the defendants, but the police first put them as real and not in the smell.
Furthermore, some doubts have been found in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants was without doubt proven.
However, the Court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head found a relative who thought he fell down and hurt himself.
The violent death was not noticed by the called rescue physician.
After a few days, criminals contacted fractured physicians who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the traces of the crime scene that their relatives cleaned up.
There's no DNA found on the spot.
The young Slovak lived in Uhersko City.
Now he's renouncing his 8.5-year penalty confirmed by the Olomuc Supreme Court last year.
He believed that the man was the head of the organized group of six young men who had a conscience of the robbery of gold.
Thieves took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopny.
The younger of the accused of the murder of the senior lives in the Uher District.
He was released from custody in August after 11 months.
Fromout starts with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, Znojma starts reconstruction of the football stadium.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken by the builders who would reconstruct the grass.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojma is divided into four stages so that it meets the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes the strune week of autumn
The Saxophone giant and the legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will do the next Wednesday point at the 18th year of the Struna autumn festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6th in the Great Hall of Lucerny, together with his quarter in Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
On the second half of the evening, Shorter will be added to the spontaneous jazz improvization of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the leadership of Martin Kumžak.
In Shorter's symphony orchestra editions, the Pegasus plays from a new album Without A Net, as well as his older Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although in August this year he celebrated his 80th birthday, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague Concert on Struns will launch his world tournament on the autumn.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The count of interpreters he cooperated with is touched by Miles Davis through Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell after Carlos Santan.
On his musical journey, he also met the Czech musician Miroslav Vitoush and Vienna’s family Jo Zavinuel, with whom in legendary Weather Report after more than a decade, they put the direction of a new style of fusion.
The last 13 years he's been performing especially with Wayne Shorter Quartet.
Jakousi afterparty after the festival will still be a club night Spotlight, which will be performed on November 9th in the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrey Triany, the audience will present the manchester trio Go Go Go Penguin with its jazz influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikiska, which will bring the electronic-jazz formation of Profound Bass inspired by dancing styles.
The ladies say that the EUFA prohibits the publicity of the judicial penalties.
Dagmar Damk, Chairman of the Board of Judges of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publicizing judicial punishments.
It is prohibited by the EUFA rules, which stated in the conversation for the Law Journal.
Otherwise, FACR would have threatened the post.
Damka also refused to avoid footballists from where she came from.
These speculations are really meaningless.
It is true that I live in Plzni, but the other members of the Commission are from the other place, for example from Prague.
So in the case of the vote, I can lose 1:6,” Damk said in response to the criticism that was ruined after the Plyzen played twice as much penalty as the other League teams recently.
Therefore, while the FACR has stopped publicizing sentences for the judge in recent months, Mr. Damk assures that they are judged for their mistakes.
" Trust me, if the committee finds out that the judge has made a mistake, it will limit the delegation to him, whatever it was in any confrontation," Damk said.
The reason why the punishment is not public is the Damic ban of the European Football Union.
"EUFA forbids such information and severe punishment."
"We're very suspicious and we're looking for something in every mistake."
"We have publicized restrictions, but I have received two very important warnings that if we do not stop it, there will be hard sanctions," Damk said.
Other countries respect the prohibition.
"We were indeed an exception," she added.
If the information continues to be published, it is said that the Commission could lose money from the EUFA for the education and development of judges.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them, we couldn't fill up a program for judiciary's education," Damk added.
The detention of Barta relates to Janusk and Bahamas: Is it behind the escape of hearing?
The President of Public Vita Bart was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Together he was detained by the head of the analytical and anti-corruption police committee Jan Petrjilek.
Detention is related to the lobbyst Roman Janousk and former Primator Paul Bém (ODS).
Information on the receipt from the news.cz server has confirmed the Czech press office a trusted source.
The listened phone calls Janouška and Bema, published last March by the Young Front Journal Today and in which both men call each other "Mazanka" and "Colibric", show the impact of Janushkov on the steps of the city under the Bam leadership.
The journal said that in 2007 the Security Information Service (BiS), which two years later fled to the ABL security agency.
He owned Bart that time.
The server of Newscape.cz noted that the detained criminal Petrjilek worked before his appearance to an anti-corruption police just for the BIS.
To the anticorruption, which was subsequently dealt with, Petrjilek crossed the same time as they were published.
"In view of the law on the protection of secret information, I can not at all confirm anything or say at all," the prosecutor Michal Muravski said from the City State Representativeship in Prague.
He refused to confirm that he was supervising the cause.
The case does not want to comment for the same reason or inspection.
The new Civil Law is prepared for six companies from ten
For the efficiency of the new Civil Law and the Trade Corporation Act since 1 January 2014, six companies of ten are intensely prepared.
Only eight percent of the company-related representatives indicated that the issues related to both key codes in their company were not addressed at all.
This comes from an examination of Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal's lawyerial office, which examined the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
With regard to the coming term of efficiency of both key codes, only now a number of managers are beginning to realize how significantly they can affect their company's business.
The biggest changes in private law in the past 50 years have been affected by all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of politics labiring, the business sector has lived long in uncertainty, whether revolutionary changes eventually occur, or not.
"There are only a few weeks left to move to new law for their companies without complications," commented Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spačil's results.
Of 61 per cent of the companies concerned intensely with new laws, 26 per cent said that their companies have already taken all necessary measures to prepare them in time.
Furthermore, 35% of the companies from this number are about to take the necessary measures as soon as possible.
On the contrary, each fifth company has not yet been dealt with recodifications, yet he has a concrete idea how to prepare for them.
In total, 11 percent have no opinion and cannot judge the problem.
Only eight percent of the companies admit that the recodification issues have not yet been addressed.
The most important legal theme relating to the new civil law is the largest number of new contracts (21 per cent) asked by companies to conclude (21 per cent) followed by the settlement of trade conditions (16 per cent) and further changes in the property catastrophe and in account of damage (10 per cent).
There will be one of the most important news of the whole recodification of the contracts, which is only within the framework of the new civil law.
The current parallel adjustment in the civil and commercial law will disappear, resulting from which the treaty law should be more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new adjustment offers many news with a focus on the greater freedom of dealing," the attorney Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukas Subdanien noted.
In connection with the Trade Corporation Act, almost a quarter of companies considers the most important topic of increasing the responsibilities of the statutory authorities.
Furthermore, the themes relating to the changes in the convening and the course of the total bunch (15 per cent) and the representation of the company (14 per cent).
The new legal amendment means accelerating obligations and possible impacts for the statutory authorities, in particular in the situation where the company is threatening or entering it.
"In practice, it means that if members of the representatives and businessmen do not deal with the care of the proper economy and do not reverse the threat of the company, they may lose the benefits obtained for the performance of the function until the last two years," supplemented Speech.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to develop the style of Cartier as a living language
My task is to preserve tradition and also lead our mark to modern things so that it does not remain an inflammated relic, explains in an interview for HN its position, Pierre Rainero, director of style in Cartier.
This French luxury house was created in 1847.
He travels through mud, river and jungle and provides medical care for free
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team are treating almost every weekend hundreds of patients
There are not too many doctors in Western Africa; only one to 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or through your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main candidates at the price of CNN Hero in 2013.
In the 2013 CNN Price, you can vote for it or for any of the 10 main candidates.
The winner gets $250,000 so he can continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle was watching his father falling unconscious and riding to hospitals that weren't equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon Yaounde in the car accident.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread into his brain and created a hematom that caused his whole life’s problems.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money for it.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to filled clinics and hospitals where he received such treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00 in the morning, hurry to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients there.
Some people die because they have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelle's father died, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon on 5,000 inhabitants.
For comparison only, the ratio in the United States is one doctor on 413 inhabitants.
And even if the doctors could visit Cameroons, many could not afford that.
Two of the five people in this country live under the limit of poverty and almost three quarters of health care costs in this country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
With poverty, they can't enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a marrow surgeon in the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he established an unprofit organization of ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas where they provide medical care for free.
Since 2008, almost 32,000 people helped with their volunteers.
Almost every Friday and up to 30 people are incorporated into supplies, attached to the roofs of medical needs and traveled by a rough territories to villages that need help.
They're not always accompanied by happiness.
Once, the vehicles must be pushed through the river and the mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as real heroes: party, singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
In these villages, medical care is indeed the reason to celebrate and Bwelle, with its wide smile and unlinked energy, is very willingly involved in local joy.
The next day, the team starts to treat hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each trip," says Bwelle.
They're coming into a village from a range of 60 miles, walking.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of health care.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, food, diabetes, parasite diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get glasses or gifted glasses or birth sheets for free – a document required by the school, but which many dental families simply cannot afford.
The team is doing simple operations under local drugs tonight.
Operations are usually done in school buildings, at the courtyard or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to release the place of another patient.
With light from the generator, the operating room and the hygiene equipment of Bwelle and his volunteers work in early mornings.
It's exhausting, but rural musicians usually help the team not lose his motivation.
"To stay up and continue to work, play drums all night," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will go back to town, tired, but proud of his work.
This group, accompanied by Cameroon doctors and foreign students of medicine, has conducted 700 free operations last year and realizes that their assistance can be much for local people.
One man said he'd be able to work again after surgery.
"It will change our family's future," said the man.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and surgeon work at Bwelle hospital also works for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
It says that this second job finances about 60% of its non-profit activities; the rest cover private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's actually asleep," Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and works as a volunteer for the Bwelle Group.
He's always in the hospital or he's trying to get money for the organization so that he can do these campaigns.
For students of medicine and medical services such as O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle in his mission, it is a great practice they wouldn't get home.
"Doctor Bwell, we washed our hands thoroughly and removed bloody skeletons or we held his tools," says O'Malley.
It's like a medical student in the second year in America.
Students volunteers usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon and often arrive with gifted medical needs.
But once they get to Yaounde, food, transport and study gives them Bwelle.
"No doubt he's a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is infinite.
Bwelle's continuous disturbance is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier, fulfilling the promise he gave to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I am so happy to do this job," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he can see what I'm doing.
Smile people, mitigate their pain - that's why I do it.
Look at the ASCOVIME website and find the way you can help.
Minister Holcat renewed the function Main Nurse for the CR
The Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of health sisters whose number is higher than 100 000 in Czech Republic.
"I think it is essential that these functions be clearly defined and formalized to have their health sisters within the structure of the Office - representatives who can always turn to," Martin Holcat, the Minister of Health, explained.
I appreciate the work of my sisters, and I think the care area deserves due attention to him by the Ministry.
In carrying out this job, it is necessary not only high professionality but also human approach and personal conviction.
"I will try with all responsibility to promote the steps that may improve the position of health sisters."
"We have excellent and fine sisters in our health, but I would like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us too much with their approach to patients to perform their calls with all empathy and help us in the public to improve the image of sisters," says Alena Schmidová.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Schmidová, also indicated that it wished to deal with various aspects of the healthcare position and willing to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-doctors and doctors.
"I don't really want to separate the calls of doctors and sisters, but I see them, on the contrary, with each person who has his competence and with other health workers, they are a played working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I meet myself with a number of problems that the sister's calls occur, I see these difficulties, and I intend to participate in their solutions."
These include, for example, ensuring simplification of medical and health documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the nurse's administrative actions have been imposed and take away the time they could and should rather devote to patients," said Alena Schmidová.
Other areas to be focused include improving working conditions, searching for ways to better mutual cooperation in the team and with the management of health providers, adjusting competences, and also job-related issues such as compliance with the law of work or non-compliance of their sisters with the insufficient number in the given time and place.
We often hear anonymous steams, which, however, are not documented in a particular case where rules could be violated.
"Where the prosecutor is not, there is no judge, so the functions of the Chief Nurse of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee of preserving anonymity of such a complaint and a particular case to let the competent authorities check," concluded Alena Schmidová.
Mgr. Alena Schmidová graduated from the Mediterranean Medical School in the Healthcare Department (Advanced in 1978) and the Filosophy University of Karlova in Prague in the Study Programme of Technology - Pedagogyka (promoted in 1992).
Since 2010, it is acting as the head of the Department of Medicine and other non-medications and recognition of qualifications in the Education and Science Committee of the ICTY.
During her professional career, she worked as a sister at a bed at the interior department and worked as a teacher at the Mediterranean School, where she was also 8 years of statutory representative of the director.
From 2004 to 2009, she acted as the chief sister of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several professional medical books and articles in professional magazines, attended lectures in the field of care.

So I can't swallow my hatred
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After years of reading, he lived, but did not write, VACLAV KAHUDA (1965) issued a new novel of Wind, darkness, presence.
The number of pages compared to the most famous part of the Houstin (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu, another significant Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl.
What moved where you wrote a novel after twelve years of silence?
I did it so that I didn't swallow hate.
Seeing around all the new and new clones of this human foolish littleness, young organisms affected by blind selfish attempts.
I don't even talk about us elders, faces ruined by powerless demands, explosive souls and oppositely polluted ideologists trying to sell their "product".
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my juroid friends, freaks, and hidden shapes.
I've been through.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning out of life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks, and then I read books at the lamp tonight.
You're talking about the feeling of embarrassment, your hate.
Was there some fracture in the past that affected you, or are you just getting old, like all of us?
It's been a long time ago, approximately in ten years.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, I lived after that.
There's still a surprised quiet boy in there.
I see more lonely exercises, everyone in their tornade of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I'll participate in this giant, thousands of years of persistent movement of the life system on this planet -- the spread of an inappropriate future.
That incredible, breathing taking the complexity of life, when every stone is the direct heir of our presence.
We are the players of sad and beautiful games when the experiment-myel forms another and more generations of beings that create some superhuman, artificial intelligence in billions of interactions per second.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or have you started at zero?
Self-speaking, or better spoken dialogue, which leads the right and left half of the brain, sometimes comes to the level and forms itself in the book.
Like the period of peace, quietly tapped by sleeping metastases of wars that may wake up one day - so my book is 12 years of silence dressed in words.
I felt the lavina of my life growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day I'll be quiet.
It's a question file that formed the brain and puts it in layers that are stored in the darkness of "between awareness".
Neocortex, a grey brain core, asks the older evolutionary offices, comes to ancient blooms of the brain tree.
He talks to the squirrels, asks snakes, seeks answers in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to the clouds on the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the star sky above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express to the ego metaphorically - would you be able to define it biologically?
The brain keeps all the memories, experiences and experiences that a person experienced in its billions of compounds and electrochemical links.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branched information trees, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, I was exposed to constantly variable presence, in uncomfortable attempts to name and understand its surroundings and decode important communications.
Sometimes there's overload disorders.
Similarly - as if you "fall" PC, from the language emulator and translator program from foreign languages, you would first flip in the operational environment, like Windows, and after several failed restarts ended at dark green-blocking bios screens, in the basic system which runs functions and cooperation on the mateboard, between the processor and the operational memory, etc.
For the one who hasn't understood what it is, I'm talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention her often - why do you care about this type of regression regularly?
Because it's a hole.
In addition to functional mechanisms of our thinking, feelings and behaviour, there will be a breakthrough.
Here it is good to quote Netzsche: "He has looked into the ruin so long as the ruin has looked at him."
The red feeling - that a person is lost if all hopes disappear, mentally "death" and a new quality is coming.
And why am I interested in it personally?
I'll answer the illustration.
Once one fell into the shadow and drowned, running days, months and years, he kept melting and reading, and those books taught him to swim - so he could live.
He became a diver.
Hopefully some of my written sentences will help someone, like the Earl's texts used to help me.
How much do you think of a reader, a specific person that your text will read?
The one that can't be said of anything meaningful, one calls it awareness, another super egem, but I think that Arthur Rimbaud was best characterized in a friend's letter:
"I'm someone else -- this reader is involved directly in the process of formulation of words and sentences."
He read the books of old Czech fairies since he was young, floating in the submarine of Captain Nema, running after the Shadows in dark streets.
Eventually, behind all the branches of the authors and their message, it sounds, "The sun is bright in the worlds of the other Karl Hynka Macha."
And when the book is outside?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the reverse reflection that people who read the book will get to you?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, perhaps after years, they randomly contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their hard life choices.
The books are actually "lives" or better say "the worlds".
They are coded into letter characters, they bear experience, the history of the regions of which language.
Whenever we can wake them to live if we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It's actually, in a way, something divine forbidden -- awakening more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It's the fact that the DNA is incorporated into charms - according to old demonological books, we're allowed to do witches.
After publication of the book you - how it is - a chain of copy readings.
I remember you used to like reading.
Are you going to go again with joy, or do you feel it different after years?
I'd rather talk about it today.
And what did I find in that?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic sign - they're intact, they don't notice themselves too much, they have friendly lights, you don't feel lonely with them.
I'll give an example - in the town of Red Church lived (and I hope he is still alive) one cod bookkeeper (named it suitable June), a joyful colleague and a good girl bull.
On one pijatic occasion, I was presented with a single chain of readers of my book, Houstina.
I looked in their eyes and then I was shown by a scratched, read example of my book.
In distress, I just put down a clear morning, and I cried shortly manly.
We all stood there silent, sneaking, and drunks cried.
Then the young blonde mixer couldn't hold it, and the scream jumped out of the window to the snow bandage.
It was downstairs.
We ran into the night's landscape, and they drove a happy wrath of sensors, a painful soul of landlands, and a thigh of incredible owners -- they poured and dried like wolfs until morning.
Each of your books is formally and contently different than the previous.
Is this also about the text of the Wind, the darkness, the presence?
It's a story.
It's a story about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts in the mouth of the human healer the words of an old Russian fairy: on the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
It's a dog, it's a gray box on it.
Terrible, scary, secrets.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we've been devils in hell once, and we've been losing what role we're going to play in this country.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free inflammation again?
Answers are eternal - Otok Brezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnamed, similar to the movement of the continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depth and in such a widespread way that completely exceeds our horizon - so with absolute certainty we do exactly in the intentions of our programmed task.
We are rewarded by the flow of dopamine, the mixture of endorphines and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to pair, die in defense and acquisition of new personal territories.
Sometimes there's a disorder, and we'll get sympathy.
Only then we have the right to call ourselves humans.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, stands on the coast of the ocean of unconsciousness and in a hole sail made from a dirty pocket catches the fluid of the moist wind.
I have to write to be human.
Obama retreats from healthcare
After the wave of criticism, President Obama left his often repeated and ambitious promise yesterday that “if you like your health program, you can keep it. ”
By appealing to hundreds of thousands of statements from the Republicans in recent days, the president was accused of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama screwed his original promise.
"A large majority of people with functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
Given what he called "the disturbance in the media" on the statements, Obama called upon the Americans who received this notification to search for new market insurance.
Most people will be able to have a better, more complex healthcare programme at the same price or even cheaper than they expected.
"You will get a better offer," he said.
His administration claims that it should not be a surprise that 5% of the population who have purchased insurance for themselves may be forced to change the programme because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on accessible care.
"I'm telling these Americans: you deserve something better," Sebelius said in her statement to the Committee for Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who observes the implementation of the Law on Availability Care, said that the launch of the Internet market has been “poor” since October.
"I am disappointed and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
The irritated Sebelius' sentence that was caught by the microphone, said yesterday to a consultant sitting behind her at the last meeting of the Committee, which was held after a violent exchange of views with the Republican Billy Long, a representative of Missouri, who was concerned whether she had to join Obama's care programme itself.
For more than three hours during the hearing on Sebelius, he repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Law on the Availability of Care did not voluntarily give up by the government's sponsored insurance, and he did not buy a program through HealthCare.gov, which is now invoking millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, owner of the PPF group, wants to buy O2.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations and according to the various sources of the agency and behind the scenes, they say it's already a hand in the sleeve.
The notification of the transaction should be made in November, probably before the auction of the frequency for LTE networks, that is, before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komarek owns a KKCG group.
The Sázka Telecommunications has auctioned frequency for LTE networks under the label.
And to a general surprise, the taste of the company was not spoken of entering telecommunications until then.
But Sazku now runs a very experienced telecommunicator Robert Grabbed.
He began as a marketing chief of Radiomobile ( today T-Mobile), followed as the director of the Slovak T-Mobil and last headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The sazka plays a few cards at once.
She signed up for the auction, and now she admitted that she wanted to run a virtual at Vodaphon.
And it makes sense.
If he succeeds in the auction, he will be able to move already existing customers from his own virtual operator.
It would probably not like it under the normal circumstances of Vodafon, but according to the information of the Economic newspapers, it could be part of much greater collaboration with both companies.
The waterphones are currently suffering from an O2 and T-Mobile competitive operator agreement that will fully share their networks.
Waterphone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the LTE network (as a new one can administer a specially designated spectrum), it does not have to auction, the respect will not disturb the exhaustion of a limited spectrum (not enough frequency for all).
The waterphone can be shared with Saska.
Waterfone will launch Sazka into its 2G/3G network (respective newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), thus allowing the company to start fast.
The barrier will start building a commodity LTE network, which will also be able to use Vodafone.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The funds he could then spend for a firm Internet provider or cable television.
What about Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is a daughter of the Czech) immediately a full-time operator with still decent profits and a wide offer of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big moloch who'll be waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would have won Kellner beyond O2 and very likely in coherence with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that networks will be shared.
The auction could eventually end with success, but probably not with the high amounts that the public budget is looking forward to.
And since next year, customers in Czech Republic could choose between calls with Vodafon, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komarka.
Aneb, two titans of the Czech business against the global huge.
Will the Czech Television ever go around without signing action?
In the age of President Zeman, a legendary scene with a garbage was entered, so it is not difficult to listen to complaints collecting evidence of the castle family.
In the past, the traditional influence of John Langer or Jaroslav Truthman had not been documented in such a way as to sign it.
True, the leadership has arrived by the editors.
However, the cases described are not answered to the question of how such admissibility of some journalists to landmen is taken - whether the response to the direct order, or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of insect empathy.
And as we already assume the general embarrassment, we cannot forgive ourselves if there are no other, at least scrupulous power interests that have not yet been given the opportunity to change the relationships on TV.
The truth is, those who say that in advanced countries, there are no emerging attempts to intervene politicians.
The truth is, however, also that it does not mean that complaints on the public media would not exist there.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mostly what they consider as the tend of their own, the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven't reached this civilization stage yet, and this situation is not here.
But also in a country that thinks of itself as the most corrupt in the world, black-white stories of evil politics and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of the unprecedented situation in which many imperfect human beings are affected.
JAN ĐANDOUREK: Damn this country: Presidents on the border of forces
It is almost ruled that in key moments the country was not head of the State in such a form that it could fulfil its state obligations.
If T. Masarik was physically and mentally five years younger, he would have experienced the end of his presidential period and events around Monache would have been a little different.
We probably wouldn't win the war, but after a symbolic resistance, aircraft could fly beyond the borders, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London immediately and not fight work for its legitimacy.
And mostly, the nation wouldn't have a cotton to this day.
Beneš wasn't a state, and Mnich was still in condition, but in the war, it started to go with him from the hill, and in February 48 he acted according to that.
To be better on this, he could go to exile for a third time and break the legitimacy of communists and their pups.
It's a shame to talk about him.
He was chosen by "Mr. President won't get into a situation to decide."
But he had to, even though a big decision with a knife on his neck was probably not at Hitler's office.
The intelligence safe of František Moravec for the last days in March 1939 said what everything should be done to make the occupation that he knew exactly on the day did not run to the Germans so smoothly and with such profit.
The senior president and the coward government did nothing but didn't believe him, but they were afraid.
The human disturbance of Gottwald let his older colleagues execute, as Moscow ordered him.
Ludwik Freedom definitely disabled by a share of normalization and had to be senior, already senior.
That Husak was a powerless and sick depressive old man in November 89 made it easier, but that's the only treasure.
Havel was lucky that he hadn't been met in the office for the last years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still freshening the tennis retirement, but many of his acts do not know that the thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of the state and the top commander of the armed forces looks like it looks, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, the external threats of the Republic are now not at risk.
Or maybe it's threatening, just it's not like that.
Then the question is, is it unusual (of historical terms) well that the president is not fully in force.
But it's not normal.
Can't we choose a president in this country once again to accept someone who is thoughtfully healthy and acceptably healthy?
Remote planets, black-white movies or a little fantasy about alien life on earth are not the subjects that the American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw in an idle.
In the concept of his quartet, which will be completed on 6 November in the Large Hall of Prague Lucerna this year at the autumn Festival of Struna, because everything is related to everything.
The partition of the jazz saxofonist Wayne Shorter is the momentual feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they are currently experienced.
They approach music as completely improvised chambers and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, is freshly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-grammy carrier, a former player, Miles Davis, and today apparently the largest living jazz saxofonist - he hates to explain.
They don't talk too much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
When I was eighty years old, I felt that the best thing to do was let my life be surprised.
"Too many people plan everything and then they are disappointed when things develop differently," Shorter said.
How insects from Thailand raised the markets of the Paris bar
You may be disgusting over the insect and not knowing about half a pound a year you will eat it completely voluntarily.
For example, he's dead in the float.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trends: it is ecological, nutrient and unique experience you are also taken care of.
The offer of the insect was set first in Paris on his meal ticket at the beginning of October Elia Daviron, the cook and the owner of Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, for whose name was the inspiration book William Burroughs Naked lunch, would be found in the fashion 18th circuit near Montmartru largely visited tourists.
With fresh avocade, baked red peppers, bracelet, and scrapberry eggs, guests can bite not only different larvas, squirrels, or water bugs, but also taste the squirrels.
Careful and specially packed trucks (to prevent the insect from damaged wings, no distortions of the legs or unharmed eyes) Davirons are sent from Thailand.
Europe's only learning to eat insects, elsewhere it's common.
The owner of the Paris bar with the pioneer menu gives a few reasons why to consume the insect.
The first of them is the ecological benefit, because the production of insects is much less costly for our planet (as for finances, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, the insect is an excellent source of proteins and omega 3 fat acids," Daviron told the Reuters station.
At the same time, a young cook does not deny his profession, simply puts a goal to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, he makes the right restaurant of pleasure, feeling sin and atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just mediating new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would have been excited about the idea of consuming the beetle decorated by the peste, but the reaction of the customers of the Paris bar to a serviced insects is very positive.
Even skeptics say they will eventually taste, even if they start with the smallest scorpions and finally choose a scorpion.
The prices of these degustation plates are moving from five to nine euros.
President of the Union of Entrepreneurs in construction in the Czech Republic Václav Mathia: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, Czech construction has been subject to a continuous decline in the volume of procurement and no interest in the State to address the investment construction problem.
The announcement of the new green savings was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who will facilitate significant amounts for heating after the implementation of the measures but also the chances for construction companies and construction material manufacturers.
Each invested billion will bring to the state more than 2700 newly created jobs.
In terms of the state's fiscal policy, significant packaging and multiplication effects are also one of the most important growth measures.
Consequently, the entrepreneurship of the CRC is essentially disagree with the Government's resolution and requests such steps to allow further continuation of the programme so that further challenges can be made in its framework.
LAW, 1 November 2013
The dog summarized the carpet, the president buried and ended up with the bars.
President Miloš Zeman left a motel hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night on his bed, and went to the castle in Lan.
What's her health condition?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that an American spying “roll too far”
John Kerry acknowledged the defensive position of the United States on his monitoring programs and, in unprecedented confession, said that in some cases, the spying “had gone too far. ”
The Minister of Foreign Affairs also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as “autoplayer” with regard to an injurious discovery of the NSA spy activity that appeared by the informant Edward Snowden.
Public information caused diplomatic storms between the American government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, through a video connection at an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the President and I and the others in the government have really learned about some things that have happened from the lastingness, because there was a possibility, with a reference to the second world war, a difficult period of cold war, and of course on September 11th."
He therefore became the first highly built member of the US government who admitted that the US spying crossed the border, but stressed that no rights were violated.
He said: “In some cases it went too far. ”
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify to people and is already conducting a thorough examination so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that NSA organisations strive for good and that its monitoring operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to detonate themselves. ”
There is a radical extremeism in the world that is firmly determined to kill and throw people into the air and attack the governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we prevented aircraft from falling down, buildings not exploded, and people were not executed, because we can learn about these plans in advance.
The Chairman of the European Subcommittee on Thursday said that American legislators are about to go to Europe to respond to the concerns of abroad relating to alleged American spying, and convinced the Europeans that they should continue to connect their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that this week he spoke to members of the European Parliament and other persons and that he was concerned about their threats to stop participation in anti-terrorism organizations because they were disappointed by the monitoring of the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the national and security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe remains with us on a ship, with regard to the common efforts to combat terrorism, said in the interview with Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and the President of the Senate Subcommittee of Foreign Relations for European Affairs.
And I'm going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in fighting terrorism despite their anger over NSA programmes.
The media reports that NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe have broken relations with some American allies, although the chief of the agencies this week said that they were incorrect and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States,
Another discovery was quoted by Snowden's documents that NSA was watching the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other 34 world leaders.
The director of the National Report James Clapper was defending allies' spying as necessary and said that it was on both sides of the common matter.
In the middle of the wave, Murphy said that his office plans a parliamentary road that should be carried out this year and hopes that members of both parties and chambers will appear in the delegation.
The names of the other legislators to join shall be published in the following days.
He said he's still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the road was aimed at helping to fix relations, he added that it would also be prepared “a well-defined training measures. ”
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people as regards the spy programs they use for years.
"While we amend our monitoring programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realize that we are not the only ones who are conducting a spy," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is heading according to the plan this weekend to the Middle East and to Poland to respond to immorality, the American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran has already led to the American follow-up activities.
Australian revoked against staying in Thai prison
A twenty-five-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to a 15-day prison on Phuket Island, when she unfairly claimed that she was attacked by a taxi driver, renounced the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally accused of the earthly court on the island of Phuket from a curve charge when the Thai police said that a taxi driver with two other men who said she was detained was attacked on Sunday on June 10th.
But later, the industrial television record revealed that after she broke up with her Australian friend, she returned safely to her hotel.
The Phuket Island police had interviews with Bamford two days before she learned that the event was made up.
She was held in the local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days of prison in a remedies in a low-cautioned facility in Phuket, instead of to be placed in prison for adult women.
She is a daughter of the former Australian League Player Peter Tunks, who asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canber for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family had “extreme concerns ” about the fate of his daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
"It is obviously a difficult period, but we hope that it will return safely to us as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford revoked the judgment and was released on bail 50,000 bahts.
The reports from Australia state that she spent a vacation in the Krabi vacation area in southern Thailand.
The legal resources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she said she had a warning that the appeal could lead to a judicial proceedings that would increase her penalty and exploit her in prison for adults.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian traveling employee Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to fix a screwed picture for tourists, which may have just been behind a freed verdict.
Jager was joking, a naked naked?
He got a buck in the defense zone, and no one caught him anymore.
Furthermore, the escape has changed after a quick forhend call.
Jaromir Jagr scored this against Tampa at Wednesday night, then on Thursday night, 119th winning goal in NHL commented on the Facebook social network.
"After seeing this video, my agent Peter Svobodo called the Czech Road Director and asked him if I should not be interested in advertising their most modern train Pendolino!", he wrote to the introduction of the Jagr overstairs.
They say we're typically very similar.
I guess I'm gonna have to finish my night training so I can't speed up.
"For I'm afraid that the Minister of Defence could then call and want to make a advertisement for the triggers!", he added the smiles.
In addition, New Jersey assigned the second victory in a row.
"And mostly, you noticed-- Maria Rotter's treatment is taking care of," Jager closed up.
Instead of allowable candles allowable gulash
October elections rather than winners brought a bunch of defeated.
These are not only parties that have not even entered the Assembly (e.g. the SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and, eventually, also the CSSD for their internal division.
Instead of the holiday candles, politicians served us with a gulash for the weekend.
By jumping the elections, the movement of Andrea Babisha, which promised the voters to change the real political way of rule.
The breakdown of the electoral outcome and the division in the victory side records political (z) the will of Mr. Milos Zeman, regardless of the wish of voters whom President Zeman has publicly supported, nor have they elected to the Parliamentary House.
Although the president lost a strategic step in front of other politics because of an unpleasant event, he remains a few other ways to get it back -- for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the CHSSD's chances to gain a prime chair in my eyes are distant, the entrepreneurs of Andrea Babish are approaching the opposite.
While the development of the licence is still a mile away from the fast and smooth creation of a stable government, but in comparison with the pre-election scenario of the left government of the ČSSD supported by the Communists, this development is, however, a better report for business in the Czech Republic and the economy.
Given the volume of resistance ANO to combine with ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely option of the ČSSD coalition, ANO and KDU-CZSL (all 111 Members).
In view of the division in the ČSSD, which has become an unreadable and weak partner in the negotiation, the result of the coalition proceedings may be quite crucial for the ČSSD.
The minority government of the CHSSD composed of "foreigners" in the castle is probably not going through.
Furthermore, any government to which the CHSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfactory ambitions of many Social Democrats that can lead to another division in the party sooner or later.
So I ask myself, "Don't we go down to other early elections?"
Other choices would already be a referendum on the strength of the ANO election mandate.
The CHSD plans for the introduction of sectoral taxes, a significant increase in taxes from income or construction of the state bank have fallen hopefully under the table.
The CHSSD, ANO, KDU-CZSL and the Dawn are contrary to the support of business, the average fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to support employment of disadvantaged persons, to reduce the lower VAT rate for the selected goods.
Third surfaces are most occurring in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
Yes, but now it's on top, so the program's most likely coalition ANO, CSSD, KDU-CHSL would be on the right.
Which, from my view, is finally a better result than a left-handed tax programme on everything that's still moving in the economy.
