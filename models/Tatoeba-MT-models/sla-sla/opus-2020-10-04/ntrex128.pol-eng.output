Members of the Welsh National Assembly are afraid that they will be called muppets
Among some members of the National Assembly was consternation, which is the effect of the proposal to amend their title to the members of the Wales parliament (Angl. Member of the Welsh Parliament, in short MWP).
The idea was created in connection with the conversion plans to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they can become a subject of a joke.
One of the parliamentists from the Party of Work expressed their concerns about his grouping, saying that the new name is rhymed with the Wales' words "twp" and "pwp".
For non-Wallet readers: in Wales the word "twp" means a fool, and the word "pwp" is departure.
One of the Politicians of the Party, Plaid Cymru, stated that its grouping was "disappropriate" from the proposal and presented other solutions.
The member of the Whale Conservative Party said that his party was "open" to change the name, but he noted that the replacement of the word "MWP" was very close to the word "muppet".
In this case, the walian letter "w" is said similarly as the letter "u" in the English Yorkshire dialect.
The Commission, which is currently working on the draft amendment of the law, took the following position: “Of course, the final decision on the future title of the Assembly will belong to them itself.”
The Law of the Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Wales National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal.
Furthermore, the Commission supported the proposal to amend the title of the members of the Assembly to the ‘Wall Party of Parliament’, the WMP in English, although the MWP's shortcut was the most popular among the society.
The members of the Assembly propose alternative solutions, and the difficulties of reaching consensus are the distress for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, which should present the draft law within the next weeks.
The reform legislation will also take into account other changes in the work of the Assembly, including the rules of revocation of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the discussion of the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of country's name
In the next Sunday, the voters will decide whether their country will soon bear the name of the Republic of North Macedonia.
The universal voting will help to compromise several decades of arguing with neighbouring Greece, in which the region is called Macedonia.
The Government in Athens has long claimed that their name of northern neighbour is a territorial prosecution and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Öorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, plebiscite members, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, reiterate that the change is necessary to allow you to join the European Union and NATO.
The calls in the New York Church of St. Martin will be milked about the problems of the harlemic churches.
“ The older people I talk to say that there was a bar and a church once on every corner, ” Michael Henry Adams said.
“Now there is no sign of them.”
As he says, the extinction of bars is understandable.
“Aktually, people are communicable in a different way, ” he observed.
“Bars have ceased to be a place of regular meetings of the community.”
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the funds from the sale of property will not be sufficient for as long as the decisionmakers consider, and that “the sooner or later will be at the exit point. ”
He added that churches can be replaced by the apartments of people who will not support the rest of the temples around them.
As he said, “the oppressive majority of those who buy a place in these buildings will be white race, and this will accelerate the entire closing of churches, because it is unlikely that new inhabitants become members of these parishes. ”
Both churches were built by a gathering of white believers before Harlem joined the Metropolitan Community in 1870 (St. Marcin’s Church joined the Community a decade later).
The original assembly of white methodists left the neighborhood in the 1930 ’ s.
The surrounding convention of the African Americans then took the right to property to the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken by a convention under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycot against sellers from 125th Street (the main trading street in Harlem), opposing the employment or promotion of the Africans.
The 1939 fire has severely damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson's parishes made plans for rebuilding the temple and ordered the construction of a bell team.
Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's church, was proud to call the new carilion “poor calls. ”
The expert who blew the bells in July described them in a different way as “cultural scarves ” and“ unreplaced historical instrument. ”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first carrilion in the world supported by a black musician, which was the artist of Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the Church of Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was waiting for a larger team.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
In the past months, the church of St. Martin had a series of complicated events with the architects and executors, and part of them were brought to place by the clergy leaders of the church, and part — the diecesion of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parafial council (organ governing the parish composed of world leaders) addressed its concerns to diecesion, claiming that “she wants to transfer the costs to the council”, although the Council did not participate in the employment of architects and executors sent to place.
Part of the parafian also complains of the lack of transparency on the diecesion side.
The shark wounded a 13-year-old diving in looking for lobsters in California
The authorities reported that last Saturday the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old diving in looking for lobsters in California. It happened on the first day of the season on the lobsters.
Attack took place just about 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he dived around half an hour with his friends when he heard the call for help.
As Hammel said, at first he felt excited by catching a lobster, but soon he realized that the child shouted: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
After reaching the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a totally broken skin in the area of the bowl.
"I began to yell to everyone to flee from the water: 'There is a shark!'," Hammel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego. Its condition was defined as critical.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During the press conference, Captain Larry Giles said that fish had been noticed a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries from the upper part of the tuberculosis.
In order to conduct the investigation and for safety, the authorities closed the entry to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad until after Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles observed that the area is more than 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's Sainsbury's network plans to expand activities in the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's network throws gloves to stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing in its supermarkets cosmetic workshops with a style of trade houses, as well as specially trained sellers.
In the context of the significant investment in the British cosmetic market – worth 2.8 billion pounds and continuously develops despite the declines in the fashion industry and the articles of the household – in 11 stores of the network, more cosmetic products will appear. If the initiative is successful in the next year of action will be extended to further points.
Return to the cosmetic industry results in searching for ways of manufacturing the area covered earlier by television, microwave and household articles.
According to Sainsbury's network, it doubles the number of cosmetic products and offers even 3,000 articles. The product such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw will appear for the first time.
Currently sold articles of L'Oreal, Mordalline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas close to those known even from Boots shops.
Furthermore, the supermarket network plans to refresh its offer of products for Boutique's makeup. From now on most articles will be friendly for vegetables, which is increasingly demanding younger clients.
Furthermore, the parfum of Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and the second in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, later the year.
The widespread internet sale and daily shopping of small food quantities in local shops makes supermarkets need to encourage more customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, President Sainsbury's, said that sales points would be increasingly similar to trade houses, because the network is trying to fight disconts such as Aldi or Lidl, offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's placed the Argos network points in hundreds of shops and introduced a series of Habitat network points since the two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing sales of food and investment profitability.
The previous attempt to reorganize sections with cosmetic products and pharmaceutical products has failed.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots. However, the collaboration was completed by the conflict on the division of revenues from supermarkets.
Sainsbury's introduces a new strategy following the sale of 281 appointments to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to Lloyds, it will contribute to the implementation of the plan, introducing a widespread offer of luxury marks to skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four network shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's Commercial Affairs, said: “We have transformed the appearance and nature of cosmetic departments to improve client sensations.
We have invested in special training for collaborators so that they can help consumers during shopping.
Our marks are able to satisfy all the needs, and friendly environment and appropriate locations allow us to draw attention to customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the ways to buy."
Peter Jones "anger" after the Holly Willoughby retreat from a contract worth 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Day TV, was "anger" when he found out that Holly Willoughby was going to retire from 11 million pounds of lifestyle brand to focus on the newly connected cooperation with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Holly Willoughby has no time for their mark offering accessories and articles of the household called Truly.
The activity was often compared to the Goop mark belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure through the Instagram Service.
The sudden decision to leave a well-prospering lifestyle mark and focus on the newly concentrated cooperation with Marks & Spencer and ITV, taken by Holly Willoughby, angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was “anger” when the popular TV presenter announced during the Tuesday Nervous meeting at his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts of value to 1,5 million pounds, it would not have time to devote their marge of the offering accessories and articles of Truly's household.
The company was previously compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Marke Goop. It was also to double the property of Holly Willoughby estimated by 11 million pounds.
After announced the decision to leave Truly's mark by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby in the Instagram Peter Jones left Britain, traveling to one of his airport houses.
The source says: “Marka Truly was the priority for Holly Willoughby.
She was bound to her future, and she wanted to take care of it for the next decades.
The decision to withdraw from the activities was totally surprised by all involved persons.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday.
In the Magazine in Marlow, goods are ready to sell."
Experts believe that the resignation of this Morning and one of the most successful stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products, including articles from pillows to clothing and household articles, as well as further delays in entry into the market.
It may also mean the end of a long - term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (the mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin for ten years had a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp established the Truly mark in 2016, and Peter Jones joined them in March at the President's position.
The couples spent their vacations together, and Jones included 40% of his shares in the TV production company belonging to Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is to be an Ambassador of the M&S Mark and replaces Ant McPartlin as a host of the I'm A Celebrety in ITV station.
The source close to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business matters. ”
A difficult conversation, “and then we fell in love ”
The president was joking about the criticism of the media caused by a note that some considered to be “a disagreeable husband of the state, ” as well as a positive relationship with the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump surrender so much?
Trump said in a ridiculous voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
"I didn't give up anything."
The President noted that Kim Jong Un was interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was cried by Trump a great step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations are delayed.
After more than three months since the June Summit in Singapore, the head of the North Korean Diplomacy Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday that he did not see “analogous response” from the United States to early North Korean disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the United States supports sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“ We are doing great with North Korea, ” he said.
"We planned a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have great relations."
The president said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un have brought positive effects: it has led to the end of the missile trials, helped release hostages and return to the other American soldiers home.
Furthermore, he defended his unusual approach during the discussion of the relationship with Kim Jong Un.
“It's easy to behave after the president. However, instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to a crushed stadium, we'd have 200 people here”, said Trump, showing a finger on the crowd gathered directly in front of us.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations have been told that their assistance is not needed.
Despite the loss of roof over the head by more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok, the authorities have not announced natural disasters, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid activities.
“Regretably, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so the situation is difficult” said Selina Sumbung.
Although the Children's Organization is preparing for the journey to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not sure that international staff will be able to operate at the scene of the event.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a national agency for natural disasters, said that the Indonesian authorities evaluate the situation in Palu in order to see whether assistance should be granted by international organizations.
The country remains completely unprepared to deal with nature’s forces in the face of the shakes constantly experienced in Indonesia.
Although the province Aceh has built shelters in case of tsunami, they are rare for the rest of the coastal line.
No syrene warning from tsunami in Palu, despite the issue of warning, had likely an impact on the number of death victims.
Even in the most favourable conditions, traveling between the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship that was stationed on the island of Lombok is going to help the victims of the earthquake to the city of Palu. However, reaching the target will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesian infrastructure as a main point of his campaign and has designated many funds for roads and railways.
However, in the face of the future elections, the president's administration is fighting the lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo was under stress to maintained in the country of religious stress, and the members of the majority of the Muslim community accepted a more conservative form of faith.
Over a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of inhabitants lost the roof over their head as a result of the fight between Christian gangs and Muslims using machetes, luxuries, shots and other simple weapons on the streets.

Cromwell's monument before the British parliament, the last victim in the fight about "writing history again"
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the remarkable actions of the Talibans to destroy many English cultural and religious enthusiasms by its radical, puritanian advocates.
However, the Association of Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as “a madness ” and“ an attempt to write history again. ”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Association of Cromwell Society, said: “Because of the ongoing debate on the remembrance of monuments, the argument of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
In the course of English domestic wars, the actions were not either ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps for his ancestor Thomas's actions, the wrong Cromwell was decided to be punished before.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell on the monument indicates how much this politics enjoyed in the 19th century and that for many it is the character that is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in the interview for the Sunday Telegraph: “In many people Cromwell was perceived – perhaps more often in the 19th century than in the present, for the parliament defender against external pressures.
Assessment of the validity of this statement is subject to a continuous historical debate.
However, it is clear that the half of the 17th century conflict has formed a further development of our people, and Cromwell is a recognized figure that identifies one of the parts of the division.
His achievements as the Lord of Protector also deserve honor and remembrance."

Ten years ago, nearly 300-kilogram pigs in Wales drove a farmer to the tractor.
Once a farmer from Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba said CBC News that these animals were not usually aggressive, but the blood taste could release violent behaviour.

They're as curious as kids... they don't want to hurt anyone.
It's just to show them due respect," he said.

More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogations
More than 20 million people were watching in six TV stations on the Thursday hearing of the candidate at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accusing the lawyer of sexual abuse that happened during the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, the commentators had to interrupt regularly delivered programmes to inform the sudden return: the agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI would conduct a weekly investigation on the charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the senate judicial committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was shaking her in a state of immunity and tried to remove her clothes during a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was convinced that this was not the case.
Possibly, the Friday number of TVs was even bigger than it was given by Nelsen's company 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC television stations.
However, other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
Furthermore, Nelsen usually has difficulty measuring publicity among people in jobs.
The number is closer to the visuality of the American Football Cup games or the division of the American Film Academy Awards.
According to Nelsen, the Fox News Channel Station, whose presenters firmly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest visibility. It was average of 5,69 million viewers during a full-day hearing.
The second place was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.2 million.
The interest on the subject remained high after the interrogation was completed.
Jeff Flake became a key figure of Friday events.
In the morning, the CNN and CBS cameras were captured after the office of this moderate Republican announced that he decided to support the nomination of Kavanaugh. On the video, he screamed at demonstrators who hampered him to enter the elevator on the way to hear the judicial committee.
Flake with his head down for a few minutes listening to unlikely opinions. The whole event was transmitted by the CNN station.
"I stand here before you and I ask.
Do you think he's telling the nation the truth?
You have strength in the face of the illness of so many women," you heard from a demonstrating woman.
Before the elevator elevator closed, Jeff Flake said that his office had made an appropriate statement and that he would appear during the interrogation of the committee.
Later, television stations continued to transmit events in the expectation of a vote on the transfer of the Kavanaugh nomination before the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination when he knew that the FBI would explore the charges next week, and the minority of the Democrats insisted.
Flake was convinced by part of the conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons from the Democratic Party.
Flake made a decision after meeting with Chris Coons and a few other senators.
The choice of Flake was important because the Republicans wouldn't have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without investigation.
President Trump filed the FBI on the charges issued at Brett Kavanaugh.

According to the local press, fourteen people received medical assistance in connection with small injuries suffered during protests.
After a year from the 1 October referendum, the tension is not weakened. Although the authorities in Madrid considered it illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for the desired catalonic secessions.
The voting in the most majority has spoken for the independence, but the frequency was low because of the widely incorporated boycott of the opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost a thousand people have suffered injuries last year in brutal launchers with police trying to prevent vote in the electoral sites.
On Friday night, groups supporting the independence of the region decided to prevent the demonstration of supporting policemen.
The demonstration took place despite this, but it was forced to change the route.
Narciss Termes, 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest, said that there was no hope for Catalonia's independence.
“In last year, we survived one of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents cried for their joy to vote, but now we are stuck in a point without exit," he said.
Despite the important, but small victory in local elections last December, the Catalonia parties supporting the secession have difficulties with continuation of action. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or expect to be arrested in connection with the role played in the referendum and later declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old mechanist who recorded a telephone protest supporting the police, said that politicians on both sides of the dispute are encouraging conflict.
“ The situation becomes increasingly tense, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalonic leaders held in custody since the end of last year, announced his willingness to launch the future elections to the European Parliament.
"The candidation in the elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of the democratic value of the Spanish government," he said.

Mengi Gateway provides Livingstone victory over Rangers 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston has won the team.
Playing this season in the Extraclase Club Livingston has made the Rangers in a freak, causing Steven Gerrard the second failure in his 18 games at the Ibrox Park coach position.
Dolly Mengi's gateway turned out to be victory, and Gary Holt's team moved to the second place in the hibernyan table.
The Gerard's team will remain in this season without victory on the trip to Premiership, and next Sunday the team will face the leader of Hearts, where he loses eight points.
Earlier, since on Thursday, the Rapid Vienna team will be hosted as part of the EUFA League.
Livingston has extended a series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt has not been defeated since his replacement last month, Kenny Miller.
Livingston missed a few occasions against unavailable opponents
The Holt team was supposed to take care of the lead much earlier, because the team's game has contributed to a lot of problems to the Rangers.
At first, Scott Robinson ran through the defense and put a shot in the gatelight, but he failed to shoot a naked, and then Alan Lithgow didn't hit the head of Craig Halkett.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer gates, knowing that they could threaten the rivals during the constant parts of the game.
And that's how the settlement gate fell.
After the Rangers released the Livingston team found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the situation of Menga, who gained naked from the middle of the criminal field.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they couldn't force the housekeeper's defense and have not caused bigger problems to Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos put one shot on Kelly's gate.
The test of Scott Pittman was defenced by the Rangers Chamber Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to get into the light of the gate from another permanent piece of convicted to Livingstone.
The Rangers continued the attacks in Livingstone's criminal field, but they couldn't use the situation. They demanded two penalties after Halkett's intervention against Glenn Middleton and one hand-playing. In both cases, the claims of the rivals were rejected.
“Fenomenal” performance of Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Excellent show and result for Livingstone.
He thinks they played great, again, beyond expectations.
Their style and composition almost changed from return to extraclass. However, you should appreciate Holt for motivating the team to the game.
This game had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role, leading a greatly organized defense, and Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall have to be very careful over the whole game.
The Rangers weren't willing to fight.
Although Gerard's leadership has a great moment, they did not support their standards in the game.
In their game, something seemed missing: only once it was able to slip through the defense of the household. It should be a serious warning for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to visiting Erdogan in Colonia
During the Saturday breakfast in Berlin (29 September) the leaders of Turkey and Germany accompanied smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of a controversy in the visit of President Erdogan in Germany, which was aimed at improving the relationship between NATO allies.
Disputes have led to differences in issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
After his meeting, Erdogan went to Colonia, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
In this city, the largest number of Turks live outside their country.
According to the police, for security reasons, a 25-third crowd gathered before the temple was blocked, but the president's envoys gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, including many Kurds, have also decided to express their opinion by condemning Turkey's leader's policy and the German government's decision to adopt politics in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the divisions that the visit of a hero politician shouted by a part of Turks living in Germany and who was considered autocrate by others.

Sudden floods caused by the hurricane of Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (may beneficial impact on drought areas)
It is rare that the tropical depression reaches the state of Arizona. It is likely to occur at the beginning of the next week. The remains after the hurricane of Rosa are moving in the desert areas of the Southwest, creating the threat of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of a sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecasts on Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix, and the rainfall will begin on Monday afternoon.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed the Twitter service that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Huragan Katrina (in 1967) approached 65 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict declines from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas Mogollon Rome in Arizona can reach a height of up to 15 cm.
In the other desert regions of the Southwest, including in the middle mountains of the Rocky and the Great Catlin, the height of declines will probably be from 2,5 to 5 cm and in some areas up to 10 cm.
For persons outside the areas threatened by sudden floods, the declines accompanied by the hurricane of Rosa can make it easier because the region has been fighting drought for a while.
Although the floods are a serious threat, a part of the falls will improve the situation in the Southwest, where the drought state is prevailing.
According to the weather.com portal, U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of the Arizona area combat touching droughts belonging to the second of the highest categories.
Huragan Rosa will first be at the California Half Island in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa was still moving with the hurricane force, reaching speed to 137 km/h. It is currently located at 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and headed north with 19 km/h.
Hurricane encounters colder waters of the Pacific of Peace, which causes his weakness.
According to the prognosis, he will hit Mexico with a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Intense rainfall in some parts of Mexico may create a major flood threat.
Weatherweather.com reported that “on the area from California to the north-west part of the state of Sonora, declines are expected from a height of 7 to 15 cm, although they can reach 25 cm. ”
Rosa's hurricane will then pass through Mexico in the northern form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, early in the morning, he will reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression. By Tuesday night, he will wander to the south part of Utah state.
“The most serious threat created by the hurricane of Rosa or its residues is a very large rainfall in the California Sealand, in the north-western part of the Sonora state and in the south-western desert areas of the United States,” states National Hurricane Center.
According to the forecasts, rains will lead to sudden floods and displacement of pollution in the desert and mud lawns in the mountains.

Trump concluded that Brett Kavanaugh “failed in anger and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The voice dedicated to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the absolute and disturbing proceedings of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at the Wheeling branch in the West Virginia.
Trump concluded that Kavanaugh “failed in anger and anger” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before the convention, and he stated and emotionally denyed the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford. The woman claims that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, a man had committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the interrogation on the charges she charged.
On Saturday, the president said that that day “the Americans could find out of the brightness, class and courage ” of Kavanaugh.
“The voice dedicated to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of support of one of the most famous lawyers of our times, the expert of the law on great benefits for the community,” he said to the crowds of beneficiaries in the West Virginia.
The President did not directly refer to Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, discussing the importance of the frequency of the Republicans in the half presidential elections.
“From the most important choices in our life, we are divided for five weeks.
I don't start in these elections, but I remain very active," he said.
"I'm still fighting for our great candidates."
Trump argues that the Democrats are taking up the policy of "representation and disturbance of activities".
As said to the CNN, one of the assistants of the important Republican Party policy, the first key vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected on Friday at the latest.
Thousands of victims of earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
As stated by the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people have died — of which many have been abducted by high waves breaking about the beaches — as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that have visited the Indonezian island of Sulawes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to participate in the festival city. At the darkness of the shore, waves reached even 6 meters high, abducting many people and destroying everything on their way.
Tsunami was the result of the earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the threat occurred yesterday, people staying on the beach did not escape immediately and they fell by the victim of tsunami," said at the conference at the Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, advocate of the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disasters of the BNPD.
“The tsunami attacked everything on its way, grabbing cars, clubs and houses,” Nugroho reported. He added that before reaching the coastal line, the nature was moving to the sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some were saving themselves climbing the trees and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
In the airport photos published by the Agency for Natural Disasters, there are many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was induced by secondary shakes.
A number of earthquakes had occurred in the territory of 2,4 million people.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT), energy released by a large fifteen earthquake was approximately twice as large as the energy of the atomic bomb thrown on Hirosimi during World War II.
The statement stated that the geographical position of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have increased the effects of tsunami.
Sutopo Purvo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said that the crash was over hundreds of houses, hospitals, trade centres and hotels.
Then he added that the bodies of the victims were found under the invaded buildings, 540 were injured, and 29 people were considered missing.
Nugroho said that death victims and damages could be bigger along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicentrum of earthquake.
According to Nugroho, the communication was “completely paralysed, ” thus no reports from the province of Donggal.
“There are more than 300 thousand people” — can be read in the Red Cross statement, and it has also been added that the workers and volunteers of the organizations are going to places affected by disaster.
“We can now talk about tragedy, even though the situation may make a significant deterioration,” states the statement.
On Saturday, the agency met with the general criticism of the lack of information about the blow of tsunami in Palu. However, the authorities stated that the waves arrived immediately after the warning.
On the amateur video available in social media, you can see a man who screams from the building, trying to warn about the coming tsunami of the people on the street.
In a few minutes, the wall of water crashed on the coast, abducing buildings and cars.
Reuters' agency was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant shortages in electricity delivery, preventing communication in the area of the Palu.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending transport planes through Jacarda and other cities, but the evacuated persons still need food and other basic articles of the first need.
The airport opened in the city is only for transportation with humanitarian assistance. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will visit the centres for evacuated people in Palu.
Over 800 victims of tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As told by Doseba T. Sinay, director of the World Vision, the staff of this organization came safely from the province of Donggala to the city of Palu and found a shelter in the tents placed in the office.
“They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses, ” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although a part of the groups slowly begins to provide assistance, the criticism appears that foreign humanitarian organisations with rich experience have been prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian law, the adoption of funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only be started after the disaster scene is announced as a area of national disaster.
It's not done yet.
"We are still officially dealing with a regional disaster," said the Indonesian Red Cross spokesman.
"When the government considers that there was a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international assistance, but it has not yet happened."
After two days since the Friday earthquake and tsunami in the Palo, friends and families of missing persons continue to hope that their close ones will be miraculously found among the destructions.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the channels.
On Sunday, the rescuemen released a woman who spent two days under the grudges next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian parallel team, trained two missing parallel parallels who participated in the end of this month in Asia games in Indonesia.
As Peter Mandagi said, other people captured in Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
“ As an experienced parallel, I am struggling with my own emotional burden, ” he said.
Gendon Subandono told him that during a few hours since the communities accompanied by parallels of information about the crash of the Roa Roa Roa desperately sent messages by the communicator WhatsApp to the sportsmen participating in the beach festival.
His messages were only marked with one gray hook instead of a couple of hooks in the blue color.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.

United States should double funding research on artificial intelligence
As Kai-Fu Lee says, the investor and artificial intelligence expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple concerns, together with the increase in China's activities in this area, the United States should double the costs of the SIS research.
The comments made are related to the announcements of artificial intelligence published by various government agencies of the United States, although the United States does not have an official SI strategy.
However, last year China presented its plan, according to which by 2030 they wanted to become the most innovative state in the artificial intelligence area.
“In the beginning, the budget for research on SI should be doubled: all other countries are far beyond the United States, and we are trying to make another breakdown in this area”, said Kai-Fu Lee.
In the interview given this week, the CNBC also said that doubled funds could double the chances of a further breakdown in the artificial intelligence area in the United States.
Lee, whose book “AI Super powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (Supermocy of artificial Intelligence: China, Krzemova Valley and the new World Order) published this month Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, chairman of Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of the most important companies involved in artificial intelligence in China, known as Face+++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University on the creation of the SI system that conquered the best American player in the Othelo game. Then he took the lead in Microsoft Research and was the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the success of the previous technological initiatives of the American government, e.g. organized by the Agency for advanced research projects in the Defence Area (DARPA) of the most interesting robot projects. He also asked for the next time of the fighting edition, as he believed it would help find future visioners.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to make a lot of effort to receive government grants.
"This is not China that takes us the best academic representatives, but corporations," Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired excellent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, change in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
“I believe that those who are engaged in artificial intelligence that have obtained a doctor's scientific degree should automatically acknowledge the green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published an artificial intelligence plan for the next generation.
As noted Lee, the Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences (National Natural Science Fundation of China) provides funding for members of the academic institutions in a way close to the American National Science Fund and other government organisations granting funds to American scientists. However, the quality of academic activities in China is lower.
During the previous period of this year, the Department of Defence of the United States established a united centre for artificial Intelligence Center, which will be involved in the work of partners from the world of industry and science. The White House announced the establishment of a special committee for artificial intelligence (Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
This month, the DARPA agency also informed the destination of 2 billion USD for an AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than 100 billion USDs per year in the SI study.
At the same time, an American initiative aimed at creating a National Intelligence Safety Commission for months has not made a step forward.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change of the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum on the change of the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow for several decades of arguing with Greece, which blocks the efforts of the country to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which the historic country of Macedonia is located, claims that the name of the northern neighbour is a prosecution for its territory.
In June, both Governments reached an agreement on name, but nationalists claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonia.
The president Öorge Ivanov said that he would not take part in voting. The boycott encouragement campaign raised doubts about whether the frequency would achieve the minimum level of 50% required to recognise the referendum as binding.
The referendum asks: “Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of the agreement with Greece.”
The members of the change of the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, argue that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of joining Macedonia, one of the countries created after the fall of Yugoslavia, to organisations such as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted in favour of the future of my country to allow young people in Macedonia to live free under the swimming of the European Union. Membership in the EU will provide us with greater security," said 79-year-old Georgievska Olivera from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, the sufficient number of parliamentists declared that it respects the results of the vote.
The change of name requires support for two third members of the Parliament.
The electoral committee has informed that no untipable events have been recorded until 13:00.
However, the frequency at that hour was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016.There was 66% of the authorized persons.
"I voted for my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, the Prime Minister of the country Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum on the change of country's name in order to open the way to membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliamentary building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and set the chairs before the tents placed by the boycotts of the referendum.
"We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join those organisations with a head-down, not with the back doors," Kauardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can contact other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaew claims that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that a huge majority will appear to change the name of the referendum, because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaew said after the vote.
He stated that voting for “yes” is “the confirmation of our future”.
In the prosecution published last Monday by the Macedonian Public Research Institute from 30 to 43% of the voters declared the desire to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required frequency.
According to another report conducted by the Macedonian Television Telma TV in the Sunday referendum, 57% of respondents will vote.
70% of the surveys found that they would support a change of name.
In order to succeed the voting, the frequency must be 50% + 1 vote.
The failure in the referendum would be the first serious strike in the policy of the Western government since the power was taken in May last year.

Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of Rockies' victory.
After losing the chance to participate in the playoff phase by Washington Nationals Scherzer did not have to appear in the first composition.
However, the admirer of Scherzer is hoping to attend a Sunday meeting against Colorado Rockies, if only Rockies keep the chances of play-off performance. Currently, the team has one victory more than Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Division.

Trump in Western Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination, Brett Kavanaugh, to the Judge of the Supreme Court, discussing the importance of the frequency of the Republicans in the half presidential elections.
"In November, we have all the achievements that we have achieved so far.
From one of the most important choices in our life, we are divided for five weeks.
Although I don't start, I remain very active. I keep defending our great candidates," he said.
He continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical democrats, and we see their actions in our own eyes.
They are determined to take power with all the means possible.
They do not care whom they will injure and whom they must be injured in order to obtain power and control; the coverage of the power and control is their purpose; but we will not give it to them."
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission “to resist and obstacle activities”.
“It was very good to see in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats“ evil, evil, unpleasant and unfair. ”
The President referred to the Senate Court Commission, calling on the name and name of the American Senator from the Democratic Party, Dianne Feinstein, which happened with a loud voice by the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the exit of the document?
"Oh, listen?
It was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The Work Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
Party is not tolerant to individuals expressing their own opinions
When actors of the Momentum organization in my party voted to give me an invoice, I was not surprised.
Finally, I am a member of a group of Members of the Party of Work, which has recently been told that they are not welcomed, and all of this because of expressing their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan met with a similar treatment because she opposed antisemitism.
In my case, the motion for incitement was due to the difference between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences related to the importance of responsible economic, national security and European policies, which, for irony of fate, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders in these matters.
The Friday announcement on the meeting of parliamentists of the Nottingham East Party of the Party of Work was read: “We want meetings to be open and productive.”
During eight years of my work, most of the Friday Friday meetings of the General Committee have looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now taking place differently. It has long been forgotten of the promise of a “hearter and mild ” policy, as far as ever mentioned.
It is increasingly clear that the Working Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is assessed under the angle of conformity with the leadership of the party.
It all began soon after the President's position by Jeremy Corbyn. The colleagues who seemed to have similar views, have expected to change my direction and take positions that I would not agree with before. They have dealt with issues such as national security or the EU's single market.
After every public statement, regardless of content, I meet in the social media with attacks calling for nomination, condemnation of centerism or leaving the Party of Work.
It's not just my experience.
I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the observations on my address are rather political.
I admire professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy is the transition to the daily order with insulting others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn concluded that the Working Party should support the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a group of people with different views, but with every proposal for "auth of uncertainty" and any change in the rule of choice of the world's view of the party is narrow.
In the last two years, I have been repeatedly suggested that I should not turn back and keep quiet, and then everything would be fine.
But that's not why I took care of politics.
Since joining the Party of Work 32 years ago as a student, as a result of the neglects of the government Margaret Thatcher, which led to the breakdown of my school class, I am trying to take care of the better quality of public services for those who need – both the local council and the minister.
I never covered my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in the Nottingham East knew my position and knew about the differences with the parties' authorities.
To those who supported the Friday proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the President of the Labourists in the face of the approaching Brexit, which would harm households, businesses and public services.
However, the most important transmission is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters (both members of the Party of Work and others): I am proud of being able to serve you. I promise that no threats to the withdrawal of nomination or clear political goals will disturb me in accordance with my beliefs and in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17 – Invincible Ayr again upstairs
Two late examples could somehow mismatch the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved a victory in this extremely interesting Scotland extralligence game.
The team was first in the table and remains the only unbearable team.
In the end, the excellent defense and better use of chances led the team to win. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his supporters.
"The so far matches were a challenge for us, but we are still invincible, so I am pleased," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose’s team, said: “We need to give respect to the Ayr players, and they have better benefited from us. ”
Ayr went to the lead at 14 minutes after Granta Andersona and raised Frazier Clim. However, the yellow card for the Scot Rory Hughes, who came to the team from Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to align the result when Jason Baggott caught the ball after the unusual chance of elevation.
Climo increased the leadership of Ayr after the collapse from the punishment right before the first half finished. He first gained an appliance, and then used the chance to raise, gaining the result of 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half well, and the application of Patrick Anderson increased by Baggota decreased the loss to five points.
Thereafter there was a longer suspension of the game due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott. The player was removed from the field on the noses. Once Ayr renewed, he increased the leadership of Stafford McDowall and Clim's elevation.
Ayr Blair Macferson received a yellow card, and Melrose reused its number: the application with an unused attempt to increase Bruce Colvin.
The households took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for the slaughter of Clim without a ball.
Climo took the chance to raise, and then he re-increased the result right after the game was resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from the punishment and allowed Gregor Henry to gain the fifth appendix for the household.
The Still Game Star starts a career in the gastronomy industry
Ford Kieran, a serial star Still Game, seems to be starting activities in the gastronomy industry. Recently discovered that he was the manager of the restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor is involved in the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular sitcom of the BBC station. He plays and constructs a series together with his multi-year comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duet announced that the coming ninth season will be the last one in the history of the series. It all indicates that Ford Kiernan is already planning the future after leaving the Craiglang.
According to official data, he was the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, even though the Scottish Sun informant suggested that Kiernan is trying to engage in “developing gastronomy” in Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us," the deprived access to the sea of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
Navy patrols around the Navy base in La Paz.
Blue flags are flying from public buildings.
In the ports of the military marine from Lake Titicac to Amazona, the following motto is shown: “The sea is ours under law.
His return is our duty."
In the absence of access to the sea of Bolivia, the memorial of the coastal line lost for Chile in a bloody conflict of resources from the 19th century is still alive.
These hopes may be largest for a few decades. Bolivia is expecting the verdict of the International Court of Justice. It is to be issued on October 1, after five years of process.
“Bolivia's activities are accompanied by promotion. The residents are unanimous, optimistic and count on a favourable verdict”, said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many of the Bolivians throughout the country will be together watching the meeting of the International Court of Justice. They hope that the organization with Hague will recognize the prosecution of Bolivia and after the decades of ineffective talks of Chile will have to proceed to negotiate on the provision of independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia, who is in the state of the next year to arise the fight against reelection, also hopes on Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts claim that the possibilities for the benefits of Bolivia are small and that even a favourable decision would not change much.
The United Nations Office of the Hague has no power to award Bolivia the territory of Chile. It also noted that it would not affect possible discussions.
As said by Paz Zarate, Chilian specialist for international law, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the final arguments were presented.
Unfortunately, the last four years in Bolivia could have removed the country from the target.
"The issue of access to the sea has been covered by the current Bolivian administration," Paz Zarat said.
An inconsistent retory of Morales has deprived the Chilians of any remnant of goodwill, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume their conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to face the situation.
For both of these countries, there has not been an exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, former President and representative of Bolivia in Hague, disagreed with the opinion that the decision process of the court was extremely fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring “extraordinary opportunity to start a new age in relation to Chile” and the possibility to end the 139-year period of disputes with respect to mutual benefits”, he said.
Calzadilla also denyed that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used access to the sea as a part of the political game.
"The pain will never quit the right to access the Peace Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an excellent opportunity to be convinced that we have to deal with the past."
The Lords of North Korea claim that nuclear disarmament will not occur until they can trust the United States.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho states that his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons until he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made during the Summit in Singapore between the leaders of both countries.
His comments appeared when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to be at the edge of the renewal of suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims that the "frozen" is as if there were no sanctions and opposition to the United States to the declaration of the ending Korean war has ever been thrown into the North Korea's knees.
Washington does not wish to agree to sign the declaration without prior adoption by Pjongjang of specific disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and President of the United States Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is a widespread scepticism that Pjongjang seriously approaches the elimination of arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only safeguarding measure.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month in preparations for the second summit of Kim-Trump.
The Paris Fashion Shows the latest line of large head covers in clothing shops.
If you want to increase your collection of hat or completely cover up from the sun, we have good information for you.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a series of crazy, over-dimensional head covers in their summer collection for 2019, which enlightened the style during the Paris Fashion Week week.
The incredibly unpractical hats were in the Instagram this summer. The designers decided to present their incredible creatives on the race.
The valentino’s excellent work was a huge bee hat decorated by a wide, peanut ring of model heads.
Other overdimensional accessories included arbuses decorated by jewelry, wizard hat, and even ananas — they were not designed to warm their head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of special masks — at the very time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had sewed mouths and were more like Hannibal Lecter's style than haute couture.
One creation was like a diving equipment with pipes and glasses, and another looked like melted ice creams.
And if you don't want to break up with a big fashion, you're lucky.
Style observators predict that huge hats can come into clothing shops.
Incredible hats follow right after the “La Bomba, ” a broad hat of 61 cm of the row that everyone was wearing — from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural mark behind this incredibly unpractical hat, which was passed through the social media, represented another great creation in the race — a broken beach bag nearly as large as it was wearing a bathing model.
The burned orange bag from the rafia, finished with rafia frogles and wrapped with a white skin hand, was marked in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection during the summer season 2019 during the week of Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a star stylest, said F.EMAIL: “I hope that large hats and beach bags will appear in the next year’s shops — because the designer has succeeded in such a great impact, it would be hard to avoid the demand for excessive accessories. ”
John Edward: Language skills necessary for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have continued to enjoy their scientific achievements — in 2018 they could commend themselves with other remarkable results of the examinations, supported by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other social enterprises.
The schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) attended by more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland are seeking to ensure the best level of services provided to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, which they have chosen in their career paths and to indicate their role as world citizens.
As an educational sector that has the opportunity to develop and implement a school-based training program, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects for selection in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: “If you speak to another man in a tongue that understands, then it gets to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it gets to his heart."
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages are first placed in the League Ratings, with highest performance rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of the students learning foreign languages have received a higher assessment of A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students received a higher assessment of A in Mandarin and 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received A evaluation.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as necessary skills that children and youth will certainly need in the future.
At present, language learning, as electoral subjects, is conducted in the same scope as the SSTEM (strict science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in programmes of teaching in independent schools and in other places.
The 2014 study carried out by the British Commission on Employment and Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) showed that the lack of language candidates was in 17 per cent due to the difficulty in the employment of employers.
Therefore, linguistic skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people to start a professional career.
These skills are necessary in a globalized world with a growing number of jobs that require knowledge of languages,
The skill that remains for life, such as learning a second language, will provide a great advantage in the future — regardless of the choice of professional development.
The possibility of direct communication with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person against competition.
According to YouGov 2013, which took part in more than 4,000 adult British, 75% of them were unable to speak in foreign language enough to talk, and the French was the only language whose percentage of people used was two-digit, i.e. 15%.
Therefore, investment in teaching foreign languages is so important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular economies in developing, will give children more chances to find adequate employment.
In Scotland, every school will differ in terms of the languages in which it teaches.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered the most important for Britain in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of the interest of the child, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose which will be taught by specialized personnel in this area.
Scotland schools are independently involved in creating a education environment that will prepare children and arm them in skills necessary to refer to success — regardless of the future for them.
At present, it cannot be denyed that in the international business environment, languages are still crucial to the future of the country, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer a large choice, diversity and level to Scotland youths.
It's just supposed to be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Debiut LeBrona at Lakers team on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans who wanted to see LeBron James's debit in Los Angeles Lakers finally waited.
Luke Walton, Coach of Lakers, announced that LeBron James would play a Sunday pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he'll play.
“More than one but less than 48,” said Walton on the official website of Lakers' team.
The Lakers team reporter, Mike Trudell, on Twitter, announced that James would probably play an incomplete number of minutes.
After the training that took place at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need to take part in pre-season games to prepare myself," he said.
So Trump election in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, Western Virginia, a series of elections.
This is the first of the five electoral cities planned by Trump, which will take place next week, along with his positions in his friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In addition to the voting confirming the suspension of his election to accommodate a free position in the Supreme Court, the Trump seeks to build support for the coming elections in the semi-meter of governments, as the Republicans may be threatened by loss of control over the Congress when the votes will be passed in November.
What time will it take tonight, so the Trump election in Western Virginia, and where will you see it on the Internet?
Trump's voter in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place today at 19:00, i.e. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
So Trump's voter in Western Virginia will be able to track live through the Internet in the YouTube service.
Trump is likely to be aware of this week's interrogations by the candidate nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, which took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with the charges of the inadequate sexual behaviour and the predicted voting in the Senate on the suspendation of the election for a period of at least one week, during the investigation by the FBI.
However, the main objective of this series of elections is to support the Republicans facing difficult November elections.
Thus, the President Trump campaign with five majorities next week aims at “mobilizing volunteers and favourants to assist the Republicans in the protection and enlargement of the majority in the Senate and Representation Chamber” — Reuters.
"Control of the Congress is such an important point in the president's schedule that, as the worst season of the campaign is approaching, he will visit as many states as possible," Trump campaign proclaimer, who did not agree on his name, Reuters.
Today's voter at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling may attract members from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the attention of the media from Pittsburgh” — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit the West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016, for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginia candidate to the Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in the surveillance.
"This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president is coming to support him in the surveillance," said Simon Haeder, politician from West Virginia University – Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: United States team shows a spirit of battle, retaining hope for winning in Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the four-some format held on Saturday afternoon could have been what Ryder Cup needed.
The collision of the spread is a totally invented sports concept, but the one in which the players really believe, and the most in such competitions.
So what's their spread at this point?
"They were leading six points, and now only four leads, so I think we have a small spin," Jordan Spieth said.
Europe, of course, leads four points, while there are still twelve points to acquisition.
However, the Americans, as Spieth says, feel wind in the sails and have good examples to imitate, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them could be commended by acquiring three points of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
The screaming on the whole throat, which was a sign of excitement, became increasingly loud during the duration of his round, drowning the key patch and wining the game when he and Thomas gained two holes in two hits.
His reflection on the earth that gave them the win with the result of 15, came to a similar scream — that makes it clear that the American team is still in the game.
"It'll be enough to focus and worry about your own match," said Spieth.
That's all that's left to each of these rivals.
18 pipes to win.
The only players who in the last two days won a larger number of points than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unfair story of Ryder Cup.
A strange, but a beautiful couple of the European team won four out of four and wasn't wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple that didn't count Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also escaped the godeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The way of the game and how their energy seems to flow to both and from a noiseful crowd proves that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari that can seal the potential victory of the European team on Le Golf National.
It would be best like they played on different holes at the same time.
However, talking about the winning of the European team is too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of fourball, when he and Alex Norren were spared.
Bogey and two-fold double on the front of nine dig the Spanish and Sweden into a hole that they would never get out of.
There's no one who can help get out of the hole on Sunday.
The fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not provide, and how a change of the strategy may occur at one point.
Europe has played better so far as a team and has taken a significant advantage of the last day, but the four-some session also showed that the US team has an incidence to fight, in which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe with the results of 10-6 includes the conduct of Ryder Cup on the final day.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after winning with the results of 10-6 Saturday 4balls and four-some with the United States.
The inspired duet — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — made a serge, taking two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods, increasing its current results on Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to maintain the trophy that he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the inadequate American team in the morning fourball, wining a series of 3-1.
The United States put a larger resistance in foursome format, wining two matches, but they couldn't lose.
In order to keep the trophy, the team of Jim Furyk has to get eight points from 12 singles that will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debitant who won four points from a row, while with Molinar (the team was called Molliwood after the sensible weekend) are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history, which won four points in four opening games.
After Woods and Patrick Reed broke up in fourball format, they defeated the pomped Woods and the American debiutant of Bryson Dechambeau, gaining even more empathy from 5&4.
Woods, who was tired over two Saturday matches, occasionally showed a genius flash, but lost 19 out of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats, and that was seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was not participating in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in foursome format to overcome the result of 2&1 Dustina Johnson and Broox Peepka — taking place in the world ranking, accordingly, items 1 and 3.
The European team, however, did not all go on the thoughts of this pleasant, cold day in the southwest of Paris.
The three-third major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set up a reference point for the Americans, gaining two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory with a result of 2&1 over Spain John Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball format and returned later to conquer Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in four-some format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history, the team was able to make a four-point loss, starting alone, although the Furyk team would only be remise to keep the trophy.
However, taking the second place two days ago, the Sunday contrast seems rather unlikely.
North Korea says "no" to unilateral disarmament without confidence.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday during the UN talk that the lack of sanctions only increases the lack of confidence in North Korea in the United States and there is no way that this country unilaterally quit nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that the North Korea adopted last year “significant measures of goodwill” such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, demonstrating nuclear trial sites and the commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see any specific response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, our national security will not be guaranteed and there is no case for unilateral disarmament of North Korea in such circumstances."
While Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington's disagreement to the “step” approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual action, its statement seemed to be significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as it had happened in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first of its history between the official President of the United States and the leader of North Korea, who took place on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un committed to work for the “denuclearisation of the Korean Self of Korea” and Trump promised the security guarantees of North Korea.
North Korea expected the formal end of the Korean war ( 1950-1953), but the United States representative announced that Pjongjang had to quit nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resisted calls to mitigate raw international sanctions against North Korea.
"United States insist on "denuclearization in the first order" and increase the pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a force, even opposing the signing of "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The claim that sanctions can put us on our knees is the punishment of people who behave against us in a ignorant manner.
However, the problem is that the lack of sanctions increases our uncertainty."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, mentioned at the beginning of the week of the United States leader at the United Nations Forum.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-ine in the past five months, and added: “If the part of the denuclearisation was South Korea and not the United States, there was no such a denuclearization impasse in the Korean Self-Denuclearization.”
However, the tone of the Ri speech was completely different in comparison with the previous year, when he said during the General Assembly of the United Nations that the targeting of the Northern Korea rockets in the United States was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump (Mr. Bad President Trump) called Kim Jong Una "rocket man" (the man of the rocket) on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN Trump Forum, who threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea last year, commended Kim Jong Una for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but also said that there was still a need to put a lot of work and also found that until North Korea was deprived of nuclear weapons, sanctions would not be removed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not designate the time range, saying: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps taken.
However, the US Secretary Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council Forum: "The execution of the Security Council sanctions must continue and be constant until we find full, final and verified denuclearization."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously emphasized sanctions against North Korea, trying to suppress the financing of the Pjongjang nuclear and balistic missile.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly Forum and later said that next month he will visit Pjongjang again as part of the preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called success.
He left Pjongjang in July, saying that progress has been made, and in a few hours North Korea condemned him for “gigantic demands”.
North Korea committed the meeting with Moon Jae-ine this month that it would dismount the testing site of rockets and nuclear complex if the United States had taken “suitable measures”.
He said that Kim Jong Un told him that “suitable measures” that he cared for were security guarantees for which Trump committed in Singapore, and taking steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard attend the course for adequate long rest
The new course at the Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all students with more sleep, which aimed at combating the growing macho culture, which was to be trained by “personal students driven by caffeine. ”
Academic students from the world's best university often have no idea of the grounds for caring for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes to be the first of that type in the United States.
He was inspired to make a course by saying a speech about the impact of deprivation of sleep on science.
“At the end of the speech, a girl came to me and said, ‘ Why do I not know that until I'm in the last year of college? ’
She found that no one ever told her about the meaning of the dream, which surprised me," said The Telegraph.
During the first time in this year, students explain how good dream habits help to achieve good results in science and sport, and improve the general sense of students.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatric professor at Harvard Medical School and a director of the University Health Service, said that this course was decided to be introduced after it was found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep within a week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of room at the academy where students click the cupcakes for coffee, curtains, exercises and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light and how sleep shortages affect sports results and how important it is to maintain the regularity of sleep.
In another section, participants find out how long-term absence of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, brain attack, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routine.
“We know that this does not lead to an immediate change in the conduct of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know -- just as everyone has the right to know what health effects we have with smoking cigarettes," said Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride from “a whole-science” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students means a growing problem of lack of sleep.
Ensuring enough sleep with good quality should be a “secret weapon ” of students to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even to avoid weighting, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to go into hunger mode, which makes the student constantly hungry,” he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the whole campus course.
The following step is to ask all students to complete a similar study program before going to a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students set a reminder when you need to go to sleep and when you need to get up, and that they are aware of the harmful impact of the “Blue Light” emitted by electronic devices and lighting LED, which can disturb the day rhythm and lead to problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga carries Gerard's team
The Rangers have suffered again during the Livingston struggle, when Dolly Menga with his arrow led to the failure of Steven Gerrard's dismounted team, gaining the 1-0 score.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to note its first victory from February 4-1 triumph over St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team twice defeated Gerard in 18 matches, causing the difference of eight points for his team with the leader Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga shot a naked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the rangers that showed a lack of engagement didn't seem to make it better.
While the Rangers noted the decline to the sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third — right behind the Hibernian with one naked loss.
The Rangers team may have another problem with the need to preserve the head injury of Calum Spence, after he was hit by an object thrown from the guest tribune.
Gerrard introduced eight changes in the team, which allowed Ayr to precede and go to the Betfred Cup Peninsula.
Holt, in turn, passed with the same eleven Livingston, who took the point to the Hearts team last week, being excited the way his well-trained team tormented at every step of his opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated the ownership of the ball, but the Livingston team did more with the ball when they got it.
They were supposed to get a naked in only two minutes when this first ball exhibition through Menga let Scott Pittman face the gateway of Allan McGregor, but the assistant didn't use his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed a deep free drop to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow who played at the defense position could only stay on the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third square, but it seemed like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos definitely recognized that he had a penalty for 15 minutes before the end of the game, when he and Steven Lawless arrived, but Judge Steven Thomson developed a colombian.
The Rangers were able to give only two customs shots in the first half, but there was an Ibrox locker, Liam Kelly, barely worried about the head of Lassana Coulibaly and the weak shot of this Ejaria's.
While the naked by Livingston in 34 minutes opening the game could be contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their own efforts to gain it.
Again, the Rangers did not deal with the deeply permanent part of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept peace, bringing it to Menga to a simple end.
Gerrard did not embarrass Culibaly for Ryan Kent — the replacement almost immediately affected the wing ball that threw the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it from his position.
The Livingston team continued to drag guests into the game exactly what they like when Lithgow and Halkett performed long applications each other.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last minutes, but McGregor was well standing in front of Jacobs, and Lithgow removed the game from the corner.
The Reserve Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again hoped for a punishment when he connected with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes back.
Almanac: inventor of Geiger
And now the page of our Sunday Morning Almanac: 30 September 1882 - 136 years ago... the day he was born in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactiveness, which eventually led to a device known as Geiger.
From then on, Geigera has become both elements of science and poculturality, such as the "Bells of Coronado" of 1950, in which they appeared to be unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: “This is Geiger's number, used to locate radioactive minerals such as uran.
When you put these listeners on, you will hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals."
Evans: “Now hear something! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that wears his name survived until today.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see ” enemy cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and destroy the enemy cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify enemy cells in treatment.
This method is to separate immune cells from the patient and change them into the lab.
Then they can "see" protein common for many cancers, and then they are injected again into the body.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a teaching immune system to identify the enemy cells, an egg cancer has been lost for over 18 months.
The method is to separate immune cells from the patient, to change them into the laboratory so that they can "see" protein common for many cancers called HER2 and then reinject to the patient of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that this vaccine is very well floating. ”
HER2 “produces the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and thick intestines, explained Professor Berzofsky.
Similar approach based on taking immune cells from patients and “training” their location of cancer cells has worked in treating a type of protein.
Kanye West is heading for a pro-trump diatrice in the Saturday Night Live program — with the MAGA hat on his head.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was “explored” in the studio during the Saturday Night Live programme after commending the President of the United States Donald Trump and said he would seek the office in 2020.
After performing that night his third song entitled Ghost Town, while he had a hat with the "Make America Great", he conducted an exhibition against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"When I talk to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump? He's racist!"
If I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from America for a long time," he said.
The SNL program began with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood Star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court Committee on the assault of sexual assaults brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't transmitted, West's recording was sent to social media by comic Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock wanted to laugh at West by posting.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had problems with his hat behind the towers.
“They've taken over me behind the clubs.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They're getting on me!
And then they say I have no choice," said Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you say that I have no choice?", and added: “I will put on a “pellery of superman, so you will not be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Let's accept."
His words have caused the “speaking ” of the public, and the members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, reports Varieta.
West was invited to the program in exchange for Ariana Grande's songmaker, whose former boyfriend, Rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many of the performing of the song I Love it in the dress of the bottle of water Perrier.
West received support from the TPUS Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who placed the following tweet: “To one of the most brave: I thank you for setting up the MAFIA. ”
The directing talk show Karen Hunter on her Twitter said that West was just “he was himself and it's absolutely great. ”
“HEWES I will not reward a person (by buying its music or clothing or supporting its “art”), which, I think, accepts and spreads the harmful ideology to my community.
He's free.
So are we free," she added.
Before the raper program, he announced on Twitter that he changed his name and that he was now “formally called Kanye West”.
However, he is not the first artist who changed his name — follows the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
A friendly raper, Snoop Dogg, accepted the name Snoop Lion, and the music legend, Prince, changed the name into a symbol, and then the artist known earlier as Prince.

Kit Harrington's throne star triggers the issue of toxic manhood
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jona Snow in the medium-century series of HBO “Game on throne”.
31-year-old actor hit the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing these roles on the screen makes young boys often think they have to play hard to be respected.
By interviewing Sunday Times Culture, Kit found that “something went wrong ” and wondered how to deal with the toxic manhood problem in the #MeToo age.
The whale, who recently married his partner from the throne game, 31-year-old actor Rose Leslie, admitted that he feels "it's pretty sure" by moving this issue.
“I feel pretty sure at the moment — where we made a mistake in the subject of manhood? ” he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, seeing from the perspective of the problem we are dealing with now?"
Kit believes that the development of toxic maleness can be partially responsible for television because of the presentation of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are born, and what are they taught?
What does he learn on television and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they must stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our times — what can you do to change it?
Clearly, it's not all right with young men."
In his interview, he also admitted that he will no longer play in any prequel or sequel of the throne game after the end of the series next year, saying that he has “continued with battlefields and horses”.
Since November, Kit will play the "True West" art of Sam Shepard, which is a story of film production and his brother, a thief.
The actress recently stated that he considers the best thing that happened to him in the throne game.
“I met my wife on the plan, which provided me with my future family and my new life,” he said.
In this many times rewarded Emma series of fantasy Rose played Ygritte — an object of loving interest in the character of Kita, Jona Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 in the area of the Leslie family property in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China notes 14% increase in new cases
China announced an increase of 14 per cent of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are affected by this problem, as reported by the health workers of the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40 000 new cases were reported.
The definite majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which means a change in the past.
Traditional HIV virus is rapidly spread in some parts of China as a result of transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected by HIV was almost totally reduced, as Chinese health officials said at the Yunnan Province Conference.
However, in comparison with year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
Transfer of HIV sexually is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism has been decriminated in China in 1997, but the discrimination of people from the LGBT community is common.
Given the conservative values of the country, research estimates that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of disease result in insufficient security during having sex in these bonds.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided common access to HIV medicinal products as part of efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one member of her team has revealed the data of the Senators of the Republican Party — “dangerous lies” and “the conspiracy theory”.
The member of the United States Representation Chamber, Maxine Waters, rejected the charges on Saturday, as if a member of its team had placed the personal data of three Republican Senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Legislatives.
Member of the Los Angeles Party of Democrats has ensured that these charges have been issued by experts and websites related to “ultra-related wings”.
"Lies, lies and even more vulnerable lies," Waters commended in the Twitter statement...
Public information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Caroline and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, and it was placed on the Capital during the interrogation of the panel in the Senate on sexual offences against the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The excursion took place some time after Kavanaugh's candidature was questioned by three senators.
Conservative parties, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP identification address of the post source was linked to the Waters office and published information on the member of the Waters team — as the Hill reports.
"This unfounded charge is completely false and it is a 100% lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security have been violated by these fraud and false charges — was not in any way responsible for the expiry of this information.
This unfounded charge is completely false and it is a 100% lie."
The Waters statement quickly criticized the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, the former newsman of the White House.
"The way of denying is bad," Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests that it does not have the right temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be bad.
He can't provoke.
He can't question the motives of the defendant.
He has to remain calm for that."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrats at the address of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive anger during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a republic candidate in the Mediterranean elections to replace the Waters position, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a gross matter," he wrote on Tweet.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed her “the competent authorities and the prosecutors of these fraudulent accusations. ”
“The actors will be demasked and drawn to legal responsibility for all their actions that are a threat to any of my team”, she announced.
Review of Johnny English: Nokaut — a spy parody with a weakened Rowan Atkinson
Looking for references to Brexit in every new film with the British thread has already become a normal one. It seems to apply to a new part of the series of films from the kind of action and the John English comedy, which started in 2003 from the film “Johnny English” and which returned to movies in 2011 with the film “Johnny English: Reactiveation”.
Will the satyr of self-reasoning about how hopeless we are, become a new export product of the country?
In any case, an incompetent Johnny English, who has been amazed, has received a license for partying — his name and name more than anything else signals that it is a promoted, comic artist designed for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, a foolish secret agent who despite his weird pleasures in the smoothie glamour, has a little of the inspector Clouseau, a scratch of Jasia Fasoli, and a drop from this guy adding one foot to the melody of the chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world secret — Atkinson played in the forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard, in which he left chaos after himself.
In the latest series of Johnny English, there are one or two moments of attention.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in a medium - century armor, while his helmet was rhythmically hit by his shoes.
On the screen, you clearly see the gift of Atkinson to physical comedy play, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low and unnecessary, especially that at present, “great” filmmarks, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humor elements seem rather to be directed to children rather than adults — I think the crazy adventures of Johnny English are not as convenient and coherent as the gags in the German Atkinson films on Jasia Fasoli.
Forever the current assumption is that the Great Britain has serious problems.
Cyberhaker interferes with the British supersecret network of spys, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field — to the fear of a agent at the service, Kevin Eldon, who, unfortunately, played a small role.
This is the last drop in the charm of a bitter premier, which is a pompatical, wasted figure already and so suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by the lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in its power, involving Teresy May, but the scenario does not give her the possibility of developing wings.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that, in order to identify all active spy, she will have to restore one of the retired agents.
And that means the unsuccessful Johnny English in his own person, currently employed as a teacher in some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons about how to become a secret agent -- a few fine gags in the class of spying by English.
English is called to Whitehall for an escort, reconnecting to his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the underwater commander — a cheerful, but a little tired character that Vicki Pepperdine plays.
So Batman and Robin participants in her Royal Majesty's secret service return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatals of Ophelia Bullet, the form played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously controlled by a charismatic billionaire of technology, who claims that he can solve the computer problems of Great Britain, which is the fabulous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their cruciation from absurd situations: dressed as waiters burn the French restaurant; they introduce chaos, swimming into the luxury jacht of Volta; and English is desolation when using a visual reality set to meet the inside of Volta's house.
In this last sequence, all restrictions are missing, but despite a nice and sound performance, the whole film is very similar to television for children.
Typical diameter.
Like in other films in Johnny English, I couldn't resist my thoughts: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson the role that would really suit his talent?
The work party denies as if it was designing a plan for the British for the four-month week of work for which they would receive a remuneration in five days
The Jeremy Corbyn Work Party will consider the introduction of a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week, receiving a remuneration in five days.
Accordingly, the Party wishes that business chiefs provide savings to workers through a revolution related to artificial intelligence (AI), giving them an additional day off.
As a result, the employees could enjoy the three-day weekend, gaining the same amount of remuneration.
The sources indicate that this idea will be "incorporated" into the economic programme of the party and the country's exit plans against workers.
The transition to the four-day working week was supported by the Congress of the Professional Unions as a way to use workers to change the economy.
The Sunday Times, a senior member of the Working Party, said: “The policy change is expected to be announced before the end of this year. ”
“It will not happen from day to day, but the four-day working week is something that is included in the approach of the Party to restore economic balance for the benefit of the employee, as well as the general industrial strategy of the Party.
The Work Party is not the first party to support this idea — the Green Party committed to introducing a four-month week of work during the election campaign in 2017.
However, these plans are not currently supported by all members of the Working Party.
The rapporteur of the Work Party said: “The week of work is not a party policy, and it is not considered by it. ”
John McDonnell, Chancellor from the Shadow Office, used the last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision of socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to restore power from "free directors" and "speculants" in public benefit companies.
The Chancellor's plans from the shadows office also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire participation, as the Government of the Labour Party could make "decision" based on detected abuse.
He also reaffirmed the plans for employees to be placed in the companies' offices and for the establishment of integration funds in order to transfer 10 per cent of their own capital from the private sector to workers who receive annual dividends of maximum 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answer the "60 minutes" program to question whether the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh can make them change their attitude
The FBI investigation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and caused the question of whether the findings of the investigation office could induce the Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
On Sunday's interview, Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that could change their attitude.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Caroline.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“When I went to the interrogation, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened when the charge came up, and I asked him, "You did it?"
He was firm, determined and clear."
Graham's opinion, however, seems to be exposed in a stone.
"I made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and a strong accusation is needed to change it," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denyed it firmly," Graham added, turning to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the persons he has given it could verify.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the event of the Global Citizen Festival, and has it at any rate contributed to reducing poverty?
On the next Saturday in New York, a Global Citizen Festival will be held, an annual musical event that can be honored by an incredibly impressive composition of stars and an equally imminent mission — the elimination of poverty in the world.
The seventh Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the show of stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the realization of the most important goal of this event, which is elimination by 2030 of extreme poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is the extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of actors to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (if it was decided to buy VIP ticket), the concert party had to perform a series of tasks or activities, such as volunteer, sending emails to the world's leader, carrying out the phone or other significant actions to help increase awareness of the goal of the elimination of poverty.
But what success can the Global Citizen commend in the vision of 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert a good way to convince them to require action, or another case of so - called “clictivism ” when people feel that they do something important by signing an Internet petition or by putting an entry on Tweet?
The Global Citizen organization claims that since 2011 it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of people supporting the action in order to achieve many different objectives.
It also states that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to declare commitments and rules of value over $37 billion, which will affect more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group introduced 390 obligations and declarations resulting from its activities, which already paid or financed for at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that secured measures have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key obligations include the Power of Nutrition, the British partnership of investors and implementers involved in “help the children in reaching their full potential ” which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate non-food in this country, after members of the Global Citizen sent over 4700 tweets.
“Thanking the support of the British government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizen, such as you, we can make social injustice, such as non-food, go into history” — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after the implementation of more than 5000 activities calling for Britain to improve the quality of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach up to 5 million women and children with food problems.
On one of the most frequently asked questions on your website, which was “How can you be sure that it will be possible to eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen answered: “It will be a long and difficult way — sometimes we will fail and fail.
But as in the case of the former major movements for civil rights and fighting apartheid, we will be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the stars that occur during this year's New York event, whose hosts will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use a military marine to the “bloc” of Russian energy exports — the Internal Affairs Secretary
Washington may “as necessary” flee to its military marine to prevent the flow of Russian energy on the markets, including those in the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of Interior of the United States, Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that the involvement of Russia in Syria, especially where it works for the invitation of a legal government, was a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to intermediate energy trade, as it is in Eastern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"United States in the case of their military marine are able to ensure that the seaways remain open and, if necessary, create blockade to ensure that their energy does not fall into the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group of non-profits, which describes itself as the “voice of energy consumer” in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more than the use and replacement of fuels," he said, comparing Russia to "the single trick" with the economy depending on mine fuels.
These statements appeared when the Trump administration continues a mission aimed at increasing the export of crop gas to Europe — which is a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to the Russian gas.
To this end, the officials of Trump's administration, including the President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project of Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that Nord Stream 2 gas gas at $111 billion, which is to double the existing transmission to 110 billion cubic metres, is an economic project.
Kreml argues that the enthusiastic opposition of Washington to the implementation of this project is based only on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States has caused a violent response from Germany, which confirmed its involvement in the implementation of the project.
The leading industrial organisation of Germany, the German Industry Federation (BDI) called upon the United States to integrate the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I believe that this is a big problem when the third country interferes with our energy deliveries," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industries Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting, the Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said she would consider running for the President in 2020
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, said on Saturday that after the medium-term elections she would consider running for the president.
During the meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidature.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and fix a corrupt government, also for women who are in the highest position," she said, "The Hill.
"I will consider my candidacy to the President after 6 November."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying that “the country leads in the wrong direction. ”
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren, without gardens, criticized Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, on Twitter Warren, she wrote: “Of course we need a FBI investigation before vote. ”
However, published on Thursday, the prosecution showed that most Warren voters do not believe that they should be running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voters from Massachusetts choosing the option "probably" said that the senator should not be running, as indicated by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidature.
The survey showed greater support to the former Governor Deval Patrick’s candidate — 38 percent of the people supported his potential candidature, and 48 percent were opposed to it.
Other famous names from the democratic camp are taken into account for the potential candidature in 2020 were Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision until January, as Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress team (PTSD) Track Gorina during the electoral set of Donald Trump
Track Palin (26 years) spent a year in Iraq after dragging into the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, which has to go back, I understand other families that feel the effects of PTSD and wounds with which our soldiers return," said the public at the electoral company Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son “the subject of tabu, ” and then she said about her son and other war veterans:“ They return a little different, they return harvested, they return, wondering if their colleagues, flights and all other members of the army will show respect for what they have given to their country. ”

18 states and Columbia District support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Columbia District support legal challenges for the new United States policy, which refuses to grant asylum to the victims fleeing from gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 states and district submitted a letter of amicus in Washington on Friday, to support the asylum-seeking person, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the reason in the lawsuit of Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union has submitted in August against federal politics, was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his brutal sons from gang" were harassing her, but American officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors of the other states who support Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States, as countries fighting the common problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy has removed the Board of Immigration Appeals of 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the General Prosecutor of the Columbia District, said in a Friday statement that the new policy "is ignoring State law, federal and international law since decades".
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered based on specific facts and circumstances, and that prohibition violates this principle”, as stated in the list of amicus leaks.
The prosecutors continued to argue in the letter that the policy deniing immigrants harms the United States economy, arguing that they can become entrepreneurs and “make the necessary workforce”.
The Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to stop giving asylum to the victims who flee from domestic violence and the gangs.
“The asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on the basis of racial, religious, national, or because of the belonging to a certain social group or who have such and not other political beliefs”, said the Sessions in its statement of 11 June on asylum policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all problems — even those serious — with whom people around the world fight every day.
Desperate rescue trials in Palu when the number of death victims has doubled in the race, which aims at finding survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more tragic.
"It's a very intense feeling," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma's mother, reassuring her upset son in the evacuation center in the destructed town of Palu.
"Each minute, the ambulance brings the body.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to the destroyed houses, searching through the water of things and trying to save everything they could find.
There were hundreds of people injured, and the hospitals damaged by earthquakes of 7.5 degrees were rapidly filled.
Some wounded, including two Harris, who had experienced spine and shoulder breaking, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of severe secondary shocks.
The tears filled his eyes, as he was telling about the violent earthquake that shake the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save yourself.
I think I've been pushed into the rumovisco of the wall," Harris said the Associated Press, adding that his family arrived in the city for the wedding.
“ I heard my wife calling for help, and her voice silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The Ambassador of the United States accuses China of the “nausea” of propaganda advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper placed a four-strong advertisement in the American journal, approving mutual benefits from the trade in America and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of the use of the US press to spread propaganda.
The President of the United States of the United States of Donald Trump addressed last Wednesday the payable supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in Iowa, accusing China of attempting to interfere with the United States Congress, which will take place on 6 November, to deny that charge.
Trump's accusation that Peking tried to interfere with the United States elections confirmed what the US officials said to the Reuters Agency that this is a new stage in the escalation of the Washington campaign aimed at provoking pressure on China.
While it is normal that foreign governments include advertising promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating trade war, which has led to the increase in customs tariffs for mutual imports.
The Chinese revenge tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to touch exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Trump Party, as the Chinese and American experts found.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States in China, and was a multiannual governor of the state of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Peking had injured American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register that China “beginning with double force, putting advertising in our own free press. ”
“With its propaganda, the government of China uses the respected American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, putting a payable advertisement in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
For this, there will be no objection votes in a kiosk on the street in Beijing and there will be no real reflection of the distinct opinions that the Chinese may have on the disturbing economic direction defenced by China, taking into account that the media are under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party”, he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish ” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans are facing inter-term elections by the Kavanaugh affair, the analysts warn them.
While many leaders of the Republicans support and weapons nominated to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual assault charges, analyst warns that these members will meet during the coming media elections with a violent response, especially by women.
The emotions accompanied by this event are extremely large, and most Republicans already wish to vote.
“This cannot be reverted”, stated in the article Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts about whether the efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) to conduct the last moment of investigation by the FBI were enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget this tomorrow and will not forget it until November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national speaker of the MoveOn Progress Group, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters scandalized the password “Arrives November” by demonstrating in the Senate Hall for the decision of the Republicans to control the Court of Justice of the Nomination of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
"The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the scale," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say he's already been tall, and it's true.
But it may be higher, especially among undecisive women from pre-grads and younger voters aged 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often do not vote."
Before the public statement of Ford, in which she detailedly described her sexual assault charges addressed to the candidate to the Supreme Court, the analysts suggested that if the Republicans decided to approve the candidature, this could be a violent response.
"The Republican Party must deal with a small mess," Michael Steele said at the beginning of last week, the former President of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it is also the way the Republicans managed and how Ford treated," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities of the United States, said on one of the information channels.
However, the Americans seem to be a little divided about whom to believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little greater support for the last one.
The new YouGov review shows that 41 percent of the respondents were decisive or rather believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claimed that they were decisive or rather believed in Kavanaugh's testimony.
Furthermore, 38% of the respondents found that Kavanaugh was likely or surely lying during the testimony, while only 30% claimed the same to the Ford.
Following the pressure by Flake, the FBI started an investigation on the charges issued by Ford, as well as at least one of the other prosecutor Deborah Ramirez, according to the The Guardian.
The Ford testified last week under oath before the Senatka Court Commission that Kavanaugh was attacked by alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the nominated to the Supreme Court showed her his genitalia during the course of the Yale University studies in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Creator plans to run a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, World Wide Web Creator, launchs launchup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google platforms.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a firm based on the open source platform, Solid, belonging to Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which persons have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company Berners-Lee, he was joking that the purpose of the creation of the Intrust was "domination over the world".
"We must do it now," he said, referring to the startup.
"There's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid Platform Technology to enable people to create their own "internet with personal data" or otherwise.
It may contain lists of contacts, lists of things to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in the same browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the Internet store with personal data is that it is entirely dependent on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls it “personal power through data. ”
According to the chairman of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and skills to help the Solid platform to all people.
Currently, Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed for the project and the community of volunteers.
Since this week, technology creators around the world could create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a total change that will bring up all their business models from day to day.
"I do not ask them for permission."
On Saturday on the Medium Poste Berners-Lee, he wrote that “the Inrupt mission is to provide trade and ecosystem energy to help protect integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform”.
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when it was founded by the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee had a lot of talks about the net neutrality of the network.
By calling for life the Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely excited to think of the next time in the development of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest's celebration by Victoria Cross during World War I
The memorial of the only priest of the Church of England, who during the first World War as a combatant was marked by Victoria’s Cross, was celebrated 100 years later in his family city.
Reverend Bernard Vann was marked on 29 September 1918 for the invasion of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never found out that he was marked by the ultimate British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone during the Rashden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the discovery of the stone at the 100th anniversary of grandfather’s celebration had “exclusively symbolic nature. ”
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the pulp Vann led his batalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel “in a very dense fog and under a strong fire from fields and machine weapons. ”
Then he hurried to the fire line, and with “the greatest courage ” he led her forward, and he made a single attack on the position of the field divisions, destroying three of them.
The Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the war ends.
Michael Vann (72 years) said that his grandfather’s actions were “something why I could never compromise but at the same time something humble. ”
With his brother, Dr. James Vanne, he put a vein on the end of the parade by Brentwood the Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was “happy to participate in the parade ” and added that“ the courage of a real hero is shown in support from many people. ”
The MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, instead, they got Peppa.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to look at Bellator 206 gala and finally not to see the main fight.
The gali program in San Jose consisted of 13 fights, including six on the main map, and was shown live at night in Britain on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the observers in Great Britain were shocked by the change in the program for Peppa.
Some were disappointed after they were not sleeping until early mornings, especially to see this fight.
One of Twitter fans described the replacement for children as a “sick joke. ”
"In accordance with the government's regulation, the content of this type is inappropriate to be released at 6 a.m., and it was necessary to change the programme for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communications of the Bellator organization when he was asked for transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes."
The President of the Bellator, Scott Coker, said they'd work a schedule to take into account the observers of Britain in the future.
"When I think about the relapse of the situation, I think we can fix this," said Coker.
"But it's Sunday sixth morning, which is why we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, there was a mass of comments that none of us sounded friendly.
We tried to fix this... we thought it was a technical disturbance.
But it wasn't a mess, it was a legal matter.
I can promise that this situation will never happen again.
We're going to limit the program to five fights instead of six -- that's the standard quantity; we've too much wanted to satisfy the fans and, unfortunately, we've predicted.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worst" because of sexuality
Tom Daley, the olympics jumping to water, says he was growing up, feeling worse than anyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to successful.
24-year-old said he didn't realize that they weren't all like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs station Radio 4 led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give the hope to others.
He also said he would be a parent, which made him less interested in winning the Olympiade.
The custom of this programme, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months free because of the disease.
When Daley showed up in the first program by Laverne, he said that growing up, he felt “willing less ” than others because “the contemporary love of boys and girls was not socially acceptable. ”
He said: “To this day, this feeling of less value and being another is something that gives me strength to successfully. ”
He said that he wanted to prove that he was “a worth of something ” so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally learned of his sexuality.
The two brown olympic medalists became a loud actor of the LGBT community and took advantage of their performance in this year's games of the United Nations in Australia to invite more countries to decriminate homosexualism.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy to live openly, without any implications, and he wanted to give the hope to others in this way.
A triple world master said that falling in love with a man, the American filmman of Dustina Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “was surprised. ”
Daley married Oscar’s winner (as 20 years older) last year, noting that the difference in his age was never a problem for him.
“ When you go through so much in your young age, ” he meant his first Olympiada at 14 years and his father’s death was three years later, ” he said, “it was difficult to find someone at the same age who experienced similar flights and falls.
The couple remained in June with the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his perception of certain things has changed completely.
"In last year, the most important thing was to me was acquiring a gold medal," he said.
There are more important things than gold olympic medals.
My gold olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died at his age of 40 years after diagnosed his brain cancer in 2011.
Daley said that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 — he wanted to take place in the first row.
“I couldn't tell him, ‘You won't be with us to be in the first row, Dad,’ he said.
“I held him for my hand when he stopped breathing; only when he stopped breathing and died, I realized that he was not unbeaten," he said.
In the next year, Daley participated in the Olympic Games 2012 and gained brown.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed all my life -- jumping into water before the crowd of people in the Olympic Games -- was the best feeling of the possibilities," he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — the Proud in Heather Small — who was accompanied by the preparations for the Olympic Games, and which still gives him a goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is issued at the BBC Radio 4 station every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing the lack of Mickelson form on the club during the Saturday Ryder Cup part
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when it's going to play its 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he'll have to work on his shape so she can't pull off her fifth.
Mickelson, playing for the 12th time in a two-year event, was sent back to the club by Captain Jim Furyk during the Saturday Fourball and Foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of action, as often happened in his case in the United States team, the five-way main winner had to spend the day on the doping of the team and working on improving his game in the hope of repairing the cause of his reference to the clue.
48-year-old who never gave the simplest hits, even at the top moment of his career, is not very well checked in the close field of Le Golf National, where the wrong hits are punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not sufficiently disgusting for Mickelson, on the ninth game on Sunday, he must face the precision of the British Open -- Francesco Molinari, who connected forces with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans (with the loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) start the game with the vervage, the Mickelson game may be extremely key.
Furyk expressed confidence in his competitor — he probably couldn’t do anything else.
“ He fully understood his role today, whispered on my back, hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
"He is very sure of himself.
He's in the famous gallery and has brought many to play his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two matches.
I thought there'd be more, but that's how it went, and we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record about Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career in Ryder Cup, which never compared to his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories on his account, 20 failures and seven remissions.
"He's funny, sarcastic, ridiculous, ridiculous and it's good to have him in the team's room," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun with him this week, which was nice to see.
It brings its person a lot more than a game."
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that a great point advantage may soon be disturbed.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before starting the single on the last day Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Dutch debited in 1997 at the Valderrama field, where he and his vice-capetant Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but the target line passed the shortest of the possible hair, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We can't forget that we had a great advantage in the Valderrama field; we also had a great advantage in the Brookline field where we lost, and in the case of Valderrama, we won only hair," said Bjorn, on the picture, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018, both Friday and yesterday, which led 10-6 in Le Golf National field.
Time will show me and all the members of the team that it's not over yet.
You're giving everything out of your mind tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
It'll only be over until the table shows the points.
We have a goal to get the trophy, and we have to focus on it.
From the beginning, I said I've focused on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know well who people are on the opposite side, the best players in the world."
Bjorn, delighted in how his rivals managed in a difficult field, added: “I wouldn’t do that better.
But tomorrow, it's different.
They start alone tomorrow, and this is another matter.
It's good to play with a partner when everything goes by thought, but when you play alone, your skills to play golf are tested to the limits of the possibility.
This is the message that you need to send to the players, it's to give everything out of you tomorrow.
The partner also has to give everything to himself."
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect from his competitors to achieve better results in single than during the game with a partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points from four.
Sam Furyk experienced great returns to the last day, as a victory team in the Brooklyn field, and then failed after the European team had done the "magical in Medinah field".
"I remember every word," said Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, in response to the question of how he was warming up to fight his rivals on the last day.
"Tomorrow we play 12 important games – you would like to start a game in a fast pace, as it happened in the Brooklyn and Medinah fields.
If this move goes in one direction, it'll make a big pressure on the middle games.
We have set up our composition properly and set up boys in a way that would allow us to charm tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to fight, facing Rory McIlroy, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European team players in the leading half of the program.
"I've decided to take this group of guys in this order, because I think he'll be able to handle all the games," Bjorn said on his own elections on a single basis.
The new German warship has been delayed again
The latest fregat of the German military marynaire should be deployed in 2014 to replace older warships from the time of the cold war, but it will not occur at least until the next year because of invalid arrangements and growing in a scary rate of costs, as local media reported.
The use of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the main ship of the new fregate of Baden-Wuerttemberg, was transferred to the first half of 2019, as reported by Die Zeit, calling on the words of the military spokesman.
The ship should be incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but as a result of the problems that occurred after the delivery, it was necessary to make changes in this ambitious project.
Four units of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Marine Marine in 2007 will replace Bremen's ageing fregates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful workshop, a series of anti-Aviation and anti-boats, as well as technological solutions to prevent detection, including reducing radar, incorporated and acustical tracks.
Other important qualities include longer periods between maintenances — the operation of new fregats should be possible even for two years away from maternal ports.
The continuous delays, however, mean that these modern warships to enable Germany to respond to foreign situations, will be overlayed at the time of the start of service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fregat appeared on the first pages of the newspaper last year, when the German marynaire officially refused to devote the ship to operation and returned him to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
It was the first time the navy returned the ship to the ship after the ship was delivered.
Not much was known about the causes behind return, but German media informed the series of key “software and equipment” that made the ship useless in the battle mission.
The software failures were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class should be supported by a crew counting about 120 sailors, or half less than in the case of the older Bremen class fregats.
It also turned out that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its achievements and reduces the possibility of carrying out the war navy of future modernisation.
It is believed that the weighting 7000 tonnes of the “Rheinland-Pfalz” ship is twice as heavy as ships of similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the failing equipment, the cost of the entire project is also the problem, including the training of the crew.
It is said that it has reached an incredible EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the use of new fregats are particularly important in the light of the recent warnings that the German force of the marine fleet is crushed.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defence Commission, admitted that the marines are “closing the ships capable of use”.
He also said that this problem has risen over time because of the withdrawal of old units without providing replacement ships.
Furthermore, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the fregat of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the Navy fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of the nerds
New research carried out in the area of property in the Highlands scotlands aims to show how the netoppers use the landscape when they acquire food.
Research results are expected to put a new light on the preservation of these unique flying mammals and help us guide future action to protect them.
Studies conducted by scientists from National Trust for Scotland will be related to populous and tiny and brown ear-ear cocktails and nerds from the family of red nights in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key places around the property, special registrators will be placed in order to monitor non-topers' activity in full-season.
The NHS workers and volunteers will also conduct research in the field using portable detectors.
The expert audio analysis of all videos aims to determine the frequency of signals sent by the netopers and the way to behave individual species.
The map and report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their behaviour in the scale of the landscape.
Rob Devar, Nature Protection Adviser in NTS, hopes that the results will disclose which are the most important areas of the seats and how they are used by each species.
These information will help to identify the benefits of the management of sites, such as the creation of architects, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for non-topers and other related species.
In Scotland and all the United States, the population of netopers has significantly decreased during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect the hills and loss of accommodation.
The wind turbines and lighting installations can also be a threat, like fly sticks and some chemicals used in construction materials, and even home cats.
The nippers aren't really blind.
However, because of the night - to - night hunting customs, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching the gain.
They use a complex echolocalisation technique to search for worms and obstacles on their way.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 foreign buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the netopers very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, control of funds and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organization even founded the first and only dedicated reservation of non-products in the territory of Threave in Dumfries and Gallowey, which is a home for eight of the ten scotch species of netopes.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says she's for a perfect territories.
"Threave has an excellent area for netopers," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and great seats.
There are, however, many other unknowns in the case of a net. The work we do here and in other property will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It emphasizes the significance of control in terms of the occurrence of netopers before accessing the maintenance work in the property, since unintended destruction of one grocery can kill to 400 males and young men, which may lead to the disappearance of the entire local population.
Netopers are protected — killing, harassment, or disturbing them, and destruction of their funds is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Officer Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public opinion to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our netoppers, and in many species we don’t even know how their populations are dealing with. ”
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape, while his lawyers intend to sue the German warehouse
Cristiano Ronaldo stated that he was charged with rape as “fake news”, saying that people“ want to promote themselves ” using his names.
His lawyers intend to sue the German information warehouse Der Spiegel, who published these charges.
The Portuguese attacker Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the Friday reports, Der Spiegel, a football player would pay a woman $355,000 for silence.
Ronaldo (33 years), a few hours after the announcement of the charges, in the instagram message on live to his 142 million followers, described these reports as “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's reports are fake news," said the five-blooded winner of the gold ball.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of my work.
I'm happy and everything's fine," a smileballer added.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing for the suit of Der Spiegel in connection with the charges they called “inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy”, as stated by Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the football player would demand compensation for “moral damage in the amount of the weight of infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
It was supposed to be held in June 2009 in Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly went to the football room, where he apparently raped a woman by analyzing, as indicated in the circuit court of Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after his apparent knees and told her that “99 percent is a good man, ” who was beaten by this“ one percent. ”
According to Ronaldo's documentation, the couple had sex, but it was a double consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she was “frightened of revenge ” and“ public humiliation. ”
34-year-old says he wants to cancel the deal now, because he still can't forget the apparent event.
During the suspected attack, Ronaldo went from the United Manchester to Real Madrid, and this year he moved to Juventus after paying for it 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain would regret the departure of car manufacturers at all times
Great Britain "will regret this for all times" if the European Union lost its world leader status in the production of cars, said the Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was "busied" when the representative of Toyota of the United States said in an interview for BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, the production in the Burnaston factory near Derby will be suspended temporaryly.
"We need agreements," said Clark.
The representative of the Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of the border delays in the absence of Brexit could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain exits at the end of March without agreement with the European Union, there will be a suspension of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of the Toyota company in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers fear to leave the EU without an agreement on how to operate cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW intends to close its car factory Mini in Oxford month after Brexit.
The main concerns, as the car manufacturers argue, are the threats related to the supply chain in the case of leaving the European Union by the Great Britain without agreement.
The Toyote production line works as a "just-in-time" in which parts reach every 37 minutes from the suppliers both in the UK and in the EU in the case of cars produced on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be difficulties at the border, which, according to the representatives of the industry, may lead to delays and deficiencies of parts.
As the company's representative said, Toyota would not be able to endure more than one day without delivery to its factory in Derbyshire, which would sustain the production.
Clark said that the Chequers Theresy May plan on future relations with the EU is "constructed precisely to avoid border controls".
“We need agreements. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy our current success but also allow us to use this situation properly," said BBC Radio 4.
“The statements not only of Toyots but also other producers indicate that we must be able to continue what was made up to a very effective supply chain.”
The representative of Toyota was unable to determine how long the production would be suspended, but warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the establishment, which would lead to reducing employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and has been a member of the Union Union's headquarters, said that the members of the union are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if there are jobs to be eliminated, they will never be restored.
The government spokesman said: “We have provided a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union.”
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, as the White House says
The important meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be “accumulated for another week” due to the continuing fight for the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, as he reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of a special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is examining the possibility of the Russians' involvement in elections, the links between the close workers of Trump and Russia and the potential impairment of the acts of justice by the President.
It's whether Trump releases the Deputy General Prosecutor, threatening Mueller's independence for months, it's a hot subject in Washington.
At the beginning of that month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about hearing in order to record the talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from the position on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
On Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports, as if he was to resign.
The date of a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was appointed on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, and there was a meeting to avoid collaboration with the senatic judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation of the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the voting in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday at Fox News Station.
When she was asked to meet with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this meeting has not yet been established, it may take place this week and may be moved for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'm sure I'll inform the press."
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held the press conference of the White House since September 10th.
The leading program, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences is not caused by an inconvenience to the "ential" television journalists, and then she added: "I will not hide that they are "steentacy".
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The current President is having more "questions and answers" sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding without giving evidence: "We have met the numbers."
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists are able to directly ask the President of the United States of Questions, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We're trying to do this regularly, and in the last few weeks we've done this very often, and press conferences will depart the seats of such sessions, in which you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions during leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with guest dignitars.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why it is, acting too free and sometimes weirdly before the gathered journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to workers from the European Union employed in NHS Scotland in the face of concerns related to Brexit
The Minister of Health has filed a letter to workers from the European Union employed in the Scotland health service in order to give them thanks from the country and to ask them not to leave in Brexita.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scotland Parliament, sent a letter for less than six months until the exit of Great Britain from the European Union.
The Scotland Government has already committed to covering the costs of considering applications for awarding "settled status" for EU citizens working in decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “In the summer, negotiations on the exit of Great Britain from the European Union continued, and appropriate decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The British Government also intensified preparations for a possible exit scenario without agreement.
I know it's a very troubled time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each personnel, regardless of its nationality.
Colleagues from all the EU and outside of it have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."

The tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie, went through an operation on the result of the injury of the head in the Saturday game with Vanderbilt Commodores, who ended the defeat of the Tennessee team with the result of 31-27, informed Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, Chief Teennessee State Coach, told journalists that a competitor had suffered an injury shortly before the end of the first half.
"He went to the side line, and then he slipped on the ground," said Reed.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line, then put it on their noses and carried out to carry out further studies.
The representative of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee), that Abercrombie was operating in Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details of the type/ size of injury” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (the second year student released from college representation for a year to train his skills) plays its first season in the Tennessee State team after transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the game's finished, he had five series, which gives him 18 series throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher treasure fee when buying real estate in Great Britain
According to the new plans of toris buying from abroad, higher treasury fees will be calculated for the purchase of real estate in Great Britain.
This move is to reduce the success of Jeremy Corbyn's actions to attract a young election.
The increase in treasure fees will cover those who do not pay taxes in Great Britain.
The Ministry of Treasure provides that it will gain even 120 million pounds per year for the help of the homeless.
Theresa May will inform today that foreigners buying real estate in Great Britain will be charged with a higher treasure fee, and the additional resources obtained will be provided for homeless help.
This move is taken as an attempt to reduce Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract the young electorate to the promises of cheaper apartments and to increase the burden of more earnings.
The higher treasure fees will be bound by individuals and non-payable companies in Great Britain. Additional measures are to help the government fight homelessness.
The additional fee, calculated in addition to the current treasury fee, including the two years ago higher rates for the second houses and the apartments purchased on rent, may be even three per cent.
The country's treasure expects that this move will make it available even 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price growth and impeding the purchase of the first house or apartment.
Since many foreigners buy property and spend most of their time outside the country, many wealthy regions — especially the capital — have become “the cities of spirits. ”
The new rules are only a few weeks after the call of Boris Johnson to reduce treasure fees that would help young people buy the first house.
He accused large developers of maintaining high real estate prices by occupying the territory but not using it. He also called for the Prime Minister May to remove cheap housing limits to eliminate the “housing scandal” in Great Britain.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulations and the end of the exemption "without reason".
It also wishes to give local authorities greater powers to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “In last year, I said that as a prime minister, I am involved in the rebuilding of the British dream that every next generation would be better than the previous generation.
This also means the repair of our inflammated housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it is not right that people who don't live here and foreign companies can easily buy real estate here as hard as British residents work.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become very distant, for this humiliation related to the need for nighting on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: “My greatest ambition is to become Scotland's selector.”
The Sunderland Team Coach, Jack Ross, says that his "the greatest ambition" is to remain in a certain moment a Scottish selector.
This 40-year-old Scott is working on the healing of the North-East Club, which currently takes the third place in League One with a three-point loss against the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after the last season he introduced St. Mirren Club back to Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to represent my country as a fighter,
But I've only managed to get to the B personnel," said Ross in an intelligence for BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“ As a child, I often watched the Scotland game with my father in Hampden, and it always attracted me.
However, such a possibility will come only if I have a success as a coach of the club."
Among Ross' previouss, the Coach of Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Coach Alloa Athletic claims that he does not feel discouraged, taking the role of such famous personalities in such a big club, rejecting previously the Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals.
"The success will now be measured to me by being able to bring this club back to the Prime Minister of League.
Given its structure and satisfactions that it has, there is no doubt its place," he adds.
"It's not gonna be easy to do, but I'm probably going to feel that I have been successful here only if I can do it."
Ross' coach's career lasted only three years before he was a coach assistant in Dumbarton, and for 15 months he belonged to the Hearts Coach Team.
Then he helped Alloa to reinstate after degrading to the third League, and in the next season, he led the St. Mirren team from the edge of the succession to the championship.
Jack Ross claims that he now feels much more comfortable than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real reverse point”, this is what Coach Alloa recalls.
"I really believed that the leadership of the team was much better suitable than playing.
It'll sound weird, because I was a fighter, making good money, and I've made a few measurable successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
You have to go through different situations every week.
They still meet me with the stress and pressure associated with the coach's work, but I feel well in this role.
I've always wanted to train others, and now I do it, and I can say that at this point I feel the most place in my adult life."
The whole intelligence in Sportsound can be listened on Sunday, 30 September in Scotland radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
Studies show that the best beer time is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday
The summer wave of heat caused a violent inflow of customers to British pubs, but it turned on in the restaurant networks.
Studies have shown that the sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but in restaurants it fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a CGA consulting company, who has developed data, says: “The continuous heat and longer than envisaged the participation of England in World Championships caused the results of July similar to the June, when the turnovers in the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the cost of the restaurants fell even more.
In June, 1,8% of the sales drop in restaurants in July has increased even more.
The offering beverages and bars have made the best — their sales growth exceeded the fall recorded in restaurants.
Food service pubs also suffered during burning, although not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just desirable.
The sale of drinks in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent in this month, and the food fell by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, a RSM company analyzing the entertainment and tourism industry, says: “They are incorporated in the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the amount of consumption 'except home' remain weather and major sports events or social events.
The fact that the restaurant networks experience difficult times, it is not surprising, although the sales decline by 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year will have particularly relevant consequences, if taking into account continuous pressures on cost reduction.
The long and warm summer came at the least useful moment for the owners of the dishes to serve food and time will show whether some more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring such needed rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, taking into account these newly open, amounted to 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowness in the development of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the pubs, bars and restaurants in Great Britain, accumulates and analyses the efficiency of 47 operational groups with a total traffic of over 9 billion pounds.
One in five children has secret accounts in social media that he hides from parents
Studies showed that one in five children — some of them aged only 11 — has a secret social account that hides from parents and teachers
A survey carried out among 20,000 over-based students showed an increase in the number of fake Insta pages
Those news have increased the fear that the sexual contents are published on them
Twenty percent of the students argued that they had the main account that they showed to their parents
One in five children — some of them aged only 11 years old — puts an account in social networks that he does not disclose to adults.
The survey carried out among 20,000 students of over-based schools showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts — the name refers to the Instagram service where you can share photos.
Those news have increased the fear that these accounts serve to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students admitted that he has a decent “master account ” that shows to his parents and also has private accounts.
One of the mothers, who ran into the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter, met a teenager who persuaded others to ‘ rape them. ’
The study conducted in independent schools by the Agency Digital Awareness of the UK and the Association of Headmasters" and Headmistres" Conference (HMC) showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 years have two profiles, and half of them are allocated to maintain private accounts.
The President of the Association of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: “It is anxious that so many teenagers make their seats on the Internet where parents or teachers can’t find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of sports" in the Scottish Athletics board
During the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics Eilidh Doyle, she was elected to the CEO.
Eilidh Doyle is the most popular scotch athlete. President Ian Beattie described this as an excellent opportunity for those who run sports to benefit from its rich international experience she gained in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys a great respect in the Scotland, British and World Lightweights community and we are sure that introduction of it to the Board will bring a great benefit to the Scotland lightlyathletics”, said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the Council of sportsmen, and I hope that I can really help to manage sports in Scotland. ”
The American, who is among his four gold olympic medals, wins 200 and 400 meters at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and now regularly performs the BBC as an expert, cannot go through a cross-blooded attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “In the last month, I had a blow.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said time would show if I'd be able to regain my performance and how much.
It was a caternity work, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again, and I returned to training!
Thank you for all the words of support!"
The advertising of lactators comparing mothers to cows raises extreme emotions on the Internet
The company that produces lactators caused a storm on the Internet, publishing a advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows.
In order to announce the market’s introduction of “first quiet lactator in the world to wear underwear, ” his manufacturer, Elvie, published an exciting advertisement in the form of a telediscope, which highlights the freedom that he provides to mothers.
It presents four real mothers dancing in a sea-filled fabric to the song in which the words "Yeah, I do, but you can't see the tail" and "If you don't notice, it's not only my tits."
And Refren goes: “Pump them, pump them, feed them, feed them, pump them, pump them, I have my lords. ”
The advertising, which was published on the Facebook site of the company, has caused great controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them claim that it is inappropriate to joke with the "horror" that happens in the milk industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like humans to give milk, they must become pregnant and be borne by a flesh, with their children taken away after a few days of their birth, ” wrote one of the users.
Elvie's lactator can be noted under biustonosis for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “It is of course traumatic for both mother and child.
Of course, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers that can keep their children."
Someone added: “This advertisement is completely distracted from reality. ”
Others with a clip weapon — one of the women found that the song was “funny. ”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I were still feeding my chest, I'd buy one.
I felt like a cow when I dragged the food away.
The advertisement's a little crazy, but I don't find it on the other day.
It's a brilliant invention," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It is a fun ad for mothers who distract food (often at work or toilet) and feel like “cows. ”
It does not aim to praise or criticize the milk industry."
At the end of the movie, women were dancing with lactators attached discreetly to their chest.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many feeding women feel like cows.
Elvie, however, is completely quiet, there are no cables or tubes and you can wear it unnoticed under biustonosis to feed, which gives women freedom to move, keep children on your hands, and even exit from the house while dragging food.
Anne Balarin, a creative partner and director in Mother, said: “Elvie’s lactator is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a brave and provocative prime minister.
By compiling women and milk cows together, we wanted to show all the challenges they're dealing with distractions of food, presenting at the same time in a funny and consistent way the incredible sense of freedom that he provides.
It's not the first time Elvie's lactator hit the main papers.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children with this product was presented during the show of Marty Jacobowski.
Thousands of immigrants have been secretly transferred to the tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of immigrant immigrants detained rapidly grows, although the number of people crossing the border every month does not actually change. It is partly caused by the raw rhetoric and principles introduced by the administration of President Trump to make children more difficult to place children in sponsors.
Most of the sponsors are usually undocumented immigrants who fear the exposition of deportation if they apply for a child.
This risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsorships and other adults living in the common farm would be collected by fingerprints that will then be transmitted to immigration offices.
Last week, the senior official in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified before the Congress that his agency has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors for children left without care.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested had not been recorded before.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are sponsors or live with them in one household are illegally in the country, and most of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That's why we are constantly pursuing them," he said to Albence.
The shelter employees say that, in the framework of efforts to accelerate the situation of children, the officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, as it had been done according to previous standards.
Many will stand through the video conference, not personally to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to the shelter workers and reports published in the past months, the longer the children are in custody, the easier they can become anxious or depressed, which may lead to explosions of aggression or escape attempts.
The defenders found that these problems are even more serious in the case of larger centres, such as Tornillo, where, because of its size, it is easier to overlook the signals that something wrong with the child is happening.
They also added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them an appropriate time to prepare emotional preparations or to say goodbye to friends may increase the trauma that many of them have already been dealing with.
Syria calls for American, French and Turkish occupational forces to immediate withdrawal
During the presentation before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Syria Walid al-Moul also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in this country has been eight years.
The Moul, who also plays the role of the Vice - Premier, said that foreign forces are in the Syrian land illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “we will judge with them. ”
“They must withdraw immediately and inconditionally”, said the Assembly.
Moulem claims that “the war against terrorism has almost ended ” in Syria, where more than 360 thousand people have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says that Damascus will continue to “keep his holy battle until the territory of Syria ” is cleansed by both terrorist groups and“ all foreigners living illegally on it. ”
At present, about 2,000 American soldiers are stationed in Syria, who are mainly training Kurdish and Syrian forces opposing President Bassar al-Asad and advising them.
Furthermore, more than 1,000 French soldiers are located in a ruined country.
With regard to refugees, Moul concluded that the conditions are good enough for them to come back, and accused “some Western countries ” of“ inhabiting irrational fear, ” which disturbs them to return.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist in these returns," he said.
"They politicize matters that should have a clear human dimension."
The United States and the European Union warned that until President Assad concludes the opposition to the political agreement to end the war, Syria won't receive any rebuilding aid.
The United Nations diplomats say that the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large bastion of rebels in Idlib has created a possibility of continuing political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has helped to prevent the great attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia from a province in which three million people live.
Moul, however, emphasized that the treaty had a “explicit time frame” and expressed the hope that the military action would be targeted in the gyhadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda Front of the Defence of the Lewant People, who would be“ eliminated”.
The UN Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee submitted by the members of the Governing and Opposition to develop a sketch of the Syrian War Constitution and to prepare for elections.
Moulem stressed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to verify the records of the current Constitution" and warned against intervention.
Why Trump won the elections again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected in 2020 for a second mandate, unless, as he hopes, many liberal observers, his president will sooner end with the removal of the office and scandal.
It would, of course, be “the most dramatic final of the president. ”
So far, there are no signs of tiring of the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN's results have doubled and reached 1.05 million viewers, and the MSNBC channel has almost tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nelsen Fox News, the average of 2.4 million perspectives in the highest watching hours is an increase of 1.7 million from four years ago, and the MSNBC program “The Rachel Maddow Show” has reached the highest results among cable TVs, attracting up to 3.5 million visitors of evening information programmes.
“People fly like blade to fire — this is something we don't understand” said Neal Bear, the chief producer of the ABC series “Designed Survivor” on the Secretary of the office, who becomes president after the attack on Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a experienced comedian creator and author of the book “Just the funny parts: and a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking In the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He recalls her taxi ride in Boston before 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
“ Why? ” she asked.
“ Because he makes me laugh, ” he answered.
"Chaos has a fun value."
Of course, reports from Washington could as well be seen on the TV to judge the future of Roe v. Wade, the acclusion of immigrants' families or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Furthermore, it is not only to be a well-informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward from secret informants during the writing of the book “Fear” on Paul Manafort's jacket of the Struss skin for $15,000 (the dress of overloaded pride), as described in the Washington Post) or on the shocking descriptions of the anatomy of President Trump's anatomy revealed by Storm Daniels.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario like before.
"What he does is partly like reality show in this regard that every evening provides new content," said Brent Montgomery, Director-General Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator "Pawn Stars", changing the site and daily returns of the Trump show (as an attack on the NFL League players or the praise of Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to miss the episode because you're going to have a lot of leverage.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of the Kauai Island, where he had his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle, watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from this, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Court Commission and the future of the Supreme Court was evaluated.
"I remember how we used to do all these crazy programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right."

Money flow from outside to election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that after the reorganization of the electoral circuits, which resulted in the race for one position now two congressmen now officials, to the 17th electoral district in Pennsylvania, a river of cash flows.
This recently created suburb district represents the representative of the Democratic, Conor Lamb, who gained his place in another district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, the Republican Keith Rothfus, presently representing district 12 in Pennsylvania, which is largely covered by the new circle 17.
The circuit maps were corrected after the January judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which decided that the old circles were imposed inappropriately, which was the advantage of the Republicans and was incompatible with the Constitution.
The race in the new district 17 began with the fight for the funding of the campaign between the main funding bodies of the Party — the Commissions of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamba's name was popular in Pennsylvania after the winning of hair in the widely commented elections to the 18th electoral circuit that took place in March.
The Republican has been sitting in this position for over a decade, and Donald Trump won 20 points in this circle.
Political experts gave the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered Salvador's punishment for supporting China, but they dropped out of this idea.
The diplomats noticed that Dominican and Panama have already recognized Beijing, despite the slight opposition of Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a heartfelt meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varella, and until the expulsion by the partners of the control team, Trump Organization had a hotel in Panamia.
The officials of the State Department decided to cancel the heads of the American diplomatic missions from Salvador, Dominican and Panama due to “new decision to stop recognition of Taiwan”, said heather Nauert in its statement of that month.
However, the reasoned sanctions were to be imposed only on Salvador, which, according to estimates in 2017, received $140 million of aid from the United States, inter alia, to combat drugs and to support development and economy.
The proposed sanctions that would cover restrictions on financial assistance and granting visas to certain persons would be very affective for this Central American country that fights great unemployment and high murder rate.
As the international meetings progressed, the officials of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference to address the security and economic welfare in order to address the requests of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
In the mid-September, the high-level administration officials clearly announced that they wanted the conference to take place, thus putting all considerations on sanctions against Salvador.
The diplomats say that now at the conference, which is currently scheduled for half October, Vice-President Mike Pence is to be an invitation to the meeting of the representatives of the administration.
Three American ambassadors returned quietly to Salvador, Panama, and Dominican. There were no new raw communications or punishment from Washington.
John Bolton's spokesman from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal contacts, provided anonymity.
Their relations were confirmed by an external analyst from the administration environment, who also expressed anonymously.
Learn History
Another element can be the report of the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible impediment of justice action by President Trump, which is now specific evidence available publicly.
According to the investigation, Robert Mueller was also investigated whether the Donald Trump campaign had something to do with the Russian attack on American elections.
If the composition of the Congress is changed, the President Trump will be responsible for preparing for the reconstitution of the voters and may even be convicted before the jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I don't want to suggest that the decline of Trump, or those in the equal positions of Europe, is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will decide how long it can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to strike against Hitler if only the West would resist him and support the Czechoslovakia in Monach.
It failed, and we lost the possibility of avoiding the years of cutting that happened after that.
History wheels turn around such reverse points, acceleration or slowing the inevitable democracy course.
There are a few such points in front of the Americans now.
What do we do if Donald Trump releases the prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, a man who depends on the future of the investigation of Robert Mueller?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since we discovered in our newspaper that last year he proposed a secret president's recording and speculated that it was not suitable for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the relationship presented by the Times is incompetent.
"How will we react if the new FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh turns out incomplete or unfair or if it is appointed to the Judge of the Supreme Court, despite his reliable charges of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we, in the mid-Presidential mandate, choose those who will bring Donald Trump to responsibility?
If we don't get through these trials, democracy will be difficult times.
But I believe that we can do it because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took my ambassador's residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the sabass candles on that table designed by a swastik.
With such heritage, how could I not look at the future optimisticly?"

Rangers Club Rangers, Graham Dorrans, with optimism awaits a game with Rapid Vienna team
Rangers take the Rapid Vienna on Thursday with awareness that the victory with the Austrians, won after the imminent remission of Villareal that this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying from the G League of Europe.
Until remiss 2:2 from Villareal the knee injury prevented the assistant Graham Dorrans from playing the game in this season, but he believes that the result will work on the Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
"It's good for us because Villarreal is in good shape," said a 31-year-old.
“We went to this game with faith that we could achieve something, and we fought the point.
Maybe at the end, we could still press them, but generally the remission is probably a fair result.
The Spanish were probably better in the first half, but in the second, we were better.
As for Thursday, this is another important evening for Europe.
We hope we can get three points, but this game will be difficult, because our opponent has got a good result in his last game, but I'm sure that by supporting the kibbies we'll go through and that and we'll fight a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard because of all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good in our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and make success."
Fear for pension savings spends night dreams to women
Although people who participated in the survey knew exactly how they wanted to take care of them, few talked about it with their family.
In a study conducted by the Nationwide, about half of the participants found that she spoke with her husband about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide selling life insurance.
Where do you start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to care for yourself if you do not express your will before.
Together with your advisor and family, discuss where and how you want you to be cared for, because this choice will be an important factor in the determination of costs.
Ask for help from the financial advisor: He may help find a way to pay for these expenditure.
Long-term care funds may come from a traditional policy for such care, hybrid policy, which allows cash to cover such expenditure or from your own property — if you have it.
Prepare legal documents: You will prevent judicial disruptions.
Determine a trusted healthcare officer who will supervise and ensure that appropriate persons act in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Consider also the employment of a supervisor who will deal with finances.
Choose a trusted person because it will make financial decisions for you and ensure that all the accounts are paid if you can't do this alone.
Do not forget details: Imagine that your parents at an elderly age suddenly need medical assistance and are just going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
You can write all your information to make it ready.
“ It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are, ” says Martin.
"What kind of medication are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's worth having a plan like that."
Man shot multiple times from the windfire in Ilfracombe

earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Because of the broken communication, the rescueers failed to get any information from the Donggala Capulet, which is north of Palu, nearer the earthquake epicentre of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the Pale disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and the Donggala coat on the Celebes Island:
The Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes, the province located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of the island. According to estimates in 2017, it was 379 800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the 40th anniversary of the establishment was held in the city.
Donggala is a cabupaten (administrative unit below the province) stretching along the north-west coast of the island for over 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 he was resident of 299 200 people.
The main branches of the Central Celebes economy are fisheries and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coast of Donghal's coast.
Another source of provincial income is the nicle mines, but they are mainly in Morvali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of Disasters in the past 100 years of earthquake and tsunami visited Palu and Donggala several times.
In 1938, tsunami that hit Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, nine people died as a result of tsunami in the West Donggali.
Indonesia is on the active Pacific fire ring, which makes earthquakes very regular.
The largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake, which visited the western coast of the Aceh province in the north of Sumatra, caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226 000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, from which over half in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, the west coast of Sumatra saw a series of strong earthquakes.

2009: Near the town of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatry, was a earthquake of 7.6 degrees.
More than 1100 people died as a result of it.
2010: The earthquake of 7.5 degrees hit one of the Mentawai islands near the coast of Sumatra. It caused a tsunami wave of even 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A filthy earthquake hit the Kabupaten Pidi Jaya in the province of Aceh, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the destructions that had resulted in the earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, the tsunami wave didn't rise, but more than 100 people killed bullshit buildings.
2018: Many earthquakes have visited the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its north side.
They caused thousands of homes to be destroyed and brought temporary problems to thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested under the charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and the candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested under charge of attack.
According to the report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from Vasilla's 29-year-old Alaska, he was arrested with the charges of domestic violence, the obstacle to file statements and resistance before arrest.
According to the police report, when a suspect's friend tried to call the police in order to file a notice of crime, he took her phone.
The KTUU station states that Palin is in custody for Matt-Su and has a $500 bail.
According to her information last Saturday, he was in court, where in his defence language he stated that he was “probably innocent. ”
There are three pregnancies of class A in Gorina, which means that he can be punished for even a year of prison and $250,000 fines.
He was also accused of the offence of class B, for which the penalty of the day of prison and the penalty of $2000 was threatened.
It's not the first time the Gorin's charges are charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother Sarah Palin called the police to report the attack.
The case is now in front of the Alaska court for veterans' claims.
In January 2016, domestic violence was accused, disrupting the application and possession of weapons in a state of immediateness in connection with this incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, the veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin, who linked the aggressive behavior of her son with the post-traumatic stress team that he acquired during his service in Iraq.
Thousands of people died as a result of tsunami after the earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed as a result of a Friday earthquake that violated the Indonesian island Celebes.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication are not working and the number of victims is expected to grow in the coming days.
The earthquake appeared near the centre of Celebes Island, which is located north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jacarda.
In social media, there are films that show the moment of disaster.
When tsunami hit the coast, on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held, there were hundreds of people.
Federal Prosecutors demand death penalty for a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York demand a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, resulting from eight deaths. It is a rare punishment — not committed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
For the attack that took place in October on the bikeway runing along West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan, the 30-year Saipov apparently used the rental truck Home Depot, which he drove on his way.
According to the Southern District of New York, the notification of the intention of demanding death punishment to justify it, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious injuries.
According to the judicial document, both of these charges are threatened with death.
Several weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Justice presented to Saipov a law of charges containing 22 positions, including eight charges of murder under illegal activities, which is usually the procedure used by federal prosecutors in the cases of organised crime, and the charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, the organization of the attack required “a solid plan and thought, ” the way Saipov carried it, was described as“ monster, cruel and immoral. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has brought injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drakea, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damian Pagnucca” is aware of the intention.
Five of the victims were the citizens of Argentina who were tourist in New York.
The last time the death penalty in the southern district of New York was delivered ten years ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was considered guilty of killing two drug dealers, but finally in September 2009 he heard the sentence of life.
The death penalty was last executed in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after two years earlier they were considered guilty of conspiracy and spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war.
Both Rosenbergs were lost on the electric chair on June 1953.
According to the court documents of Saipov, which came from Uzbekistan, in months after the attack, he did not show out of conscience.
The police say he told the investigator he was feeling good about what he did.
According to the law of the charge, Saipov confessed to the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS films he watched on the phone.
According to the police, the ISIS flag was also required in his hospital room.
A charge of 22 charges says he's innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “because of obvious reasons disappointed ” by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to require death penalty and to reject life without the possibility of early release after confession will only extend the suffering that these events have brought to all interested persons” he said.
The Saipov defense team asked the prosecutors earlier not to demand death penalty.
Toris parliamentary said that NIGEL FRAGE should be responsible for negotiations on Brexit
During today’s protest, which took place during the Toris conference, Nigel Farage promised “to mobilize the army of the people. ”
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians must feel "heat" beating from Eurosceptics when one of the parliamentists of Theresy May suggested that he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
The Deputy of Conservatives Peter Bone told the protestants in Birmingham that if Farage was a secretary for Brexit, “United Kingdom would have already been outside the Union. ”
However, the integration of the torises that are opposed to remain in the community to a separate protest against Brexit, which was held in the city, further emphasized the burden of the task of achieving their deeply divided series before Theresa May.
The Prime Minister has hardly tried to implement its plan of compromise from Chequers among the attacks of Brexit, its opponents and the European Union itself.
Her allies argue that, despite objections, she will seek to conclude a deal with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and labourists to make a choice between its proposal and the chaos.
Peter Bone told Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to “flick the plan out of Chequers. ”
He suggested that Nigel Farage should be a commissioner, who is responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had taken care of this, we'd be out of the Union now,” he said.
The Deputy of Wellingborough added: “I support Brexit, but we must throw the plan out of Chequers. ”
When he introduced his objection to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subjected to anyone now.
We want to establish our rights in our own country."
Peter Bone rejected the suggestions that citizens had changed their mind since the vote in 2016: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain in the Union is completely false.”
The demonstration was also supported by Brexit Andrea Jenkins from the Toris party, who told the reporters: “I'm just saying, Madam Prime Minister, please listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not pleased to support generally, the opposition will not vote on it, our party or our activists who are inhabiting the streets and who chose us, also do not support it.
Please quit the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a statement addressed to the Prime Minister May, she added: “The premises keep their positions when they keep their promises. ”
Nigel Farage concluded that politicians involved in the demonstration must feel hot if they were to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell 'we won't let you do that.'
Turning to the excited crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians at the edge of the betrayal of Brexit feel hot.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country who won us in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent, independent, proud of the United Kingdom."
At that time, Brexit opponents marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration was held.
The bunch of activists waved the "Toris versus Brexit" after the group was created this weekend.
The Laborist Activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, laughed at conservatives for the security of the party application at the beginning of the conference.
"There are people who claim that they can organize information systems and all technology to support the Canadian plan plus a liquid border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.

Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the command of the team allowed him to win with Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's command would have a great impact on the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, began very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two circles and forced Vettel to attack his colleague from the team.
Vettel went to the service point first and let Hamilton ride in the tail of the peleton, which should decide on the fate of the race.
The Mercedes rival went to box in the next circle and appeared behind the Vettel, but after the round round, the driver Ferrari unwillingly left the inside part of the track, risking the defense after a double rival to defense the position on the third turn, Hamilton took the lead.
Max Verstappen launched from the end of the rate and at his 21th birthday at the end of the first circle, he found himself in the seventh place.

Finally, he went to the 44th circle service point, but in the remaining eight circles, he couldn't accelerate.
"It was a tough day, because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and turned out to be a gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The whole team has done everything to take two first places," Hamilton said.
It was really a bad word of the body.
During the meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump screwed up with Senator Dianna Feinstein, who claimed that she did not disclose the contents of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which she accused the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony made by Christina Ford before the Commission of the Senate for Justice. Instead, he stated that what happened in the Senate showed that people were “loss, malicious and liar”.
"What could have happened is one, but this beautiful situation in the senate, which we have witnessed for a few days when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, malicious, malicious and liar," he said.
"We see what was published and revealed, and then they say to us, "Oh, I didn't."
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianno Feinstein, did you disclose that?
Remember her answer... did you disclose the contents of this document? -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose her."
Wait, wait, wait.
We have revealed... No, we have not revealed," he added, precreating the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christine Ford with a description of the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and his content came out at the beginning of September. Your senator denies, as if the source of the excursion was her office.
“I didn't hide Dr. Ford's insinuation, I didn't reveal her history, ” Feinstein told the committee, according to the newspaper The Hill.
"She asked me for discretion, and according to her request, I did not disclose these contents."
However, her statement was not convinced by the president who commented on them during the Saturday meeting: “I say to you, it was a really bad body speaking.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate against the Supreme Court of Justice, whom three women accused of sexual abuse, the President suggested that the Democrats are using insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take power by all means.
They seem to be a brutality, anger, no matter who they hurt, who they have to destroy in order to take power and control," the president said, according to the mediaite service.

The air traffic controller is dying, helping hundreds of people in the plane escape from earthquake
The air traffic controller from Indonesia was cried by a hero after he died, helping to launch a plane safely with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people died, and many were considered missing after a large earthquake, which hit the Indonezian island Celebes on Friday, causing tsunamis.
There are still strong secondary shakes in the area. Many people in the city of Palu were imprisoned.
Although his colleagues fled, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in a broken tower of flight control at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palo.
He remained there to make sure that the Batik Air Air Air Air Air Air Air (Flight 6321), which was just on the starting belt, has launched safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he seemed to have crashed.
He died in the hospital.
According to the Australian ABC News rapporteur of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the controller's decision probably saved lives to hundreds of people.
We organized a helicopter from the city of Balikpapan to Borneo to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthony left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palo.
“ This message broke our hearts, ” he added.
However, the authorities are afraid that the number of death victims can reach thousands. The National Agency for the Elimination of the Effects of Disasters informs that the possibility of accommodation to the towns of Donghal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"We believe that the harvest of death continues to increase, because many bodies are still under the burden and cannot be reached," said Suphopo Pruvo Nugroho's agency.
Six metres of waves of tsunami destroyed Palu, where the mass funeral of the victims will be held on Sunday.
Military and civil aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to the Sky News Station: “The ambulances constantly import body.
It's starting to lack drinking water.
Small shops are plundered."
John Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said CNN: “Indonezian Red Cross is rushing for survival, but we do not know what we will do.
It's a tragedy, and it might be worse."
On Sunday, the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palo, who turned to the army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to perform all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?", says CNN.
This year, Indonesia has already seen the earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the Lombok Island.

The airlines that have crashed on the lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific are informed that one person was missing and earlier claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a drowning plane.
Air Niugini reported that, according to the saturday afternoon, one man who traveled by a ferral plane could not be numbered.
They assured with local authorities, hospitals and investigators that they were trying to find him.
However, they did not give an immediate response to requests for additional details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the island of Chuuk, the other passengers and crew were helped by local ships.
The officials informed on Friday that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airlines said that on Saturday, six passengers were left in the hospital, all stable.
It's not clear what caused the disaster.
The airlines and the United States warline claim that the plane landed on the lagoon near the launch belt.
According to some witnesses, he fell out of the belt.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was very low.
“ This has helped us very much, ” he said.
Jaynes said he managed to get other people through the waterway to get out of an emergency plane that drowns.
He said that the members of the board staff panicked and screamed, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy war informed that the savior was also helped by mariners working nearby on the modernisation of the coast. They managed to transport people to the shore before the plane drowned at a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network database in the last two decades in aircraft disasters registered in Papua New Guinea, 111 people died. However, there are no air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed events from the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor ended the presentation of evidence in the re-process of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst from the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for many hours as a court officer in the field of information analysis.
He described the judges as using cell phone records he resumed the route of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
According to Clarion Ledger's newspaper, Rowlett said he had obtained data on location from various cell phones, which showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the ferral evening.
When the data confirmed that when Quinton was going to stay with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessice Chambers, the police decided to interrogate Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he wasn't in town that day.
On the question of the prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth, saying that he was in Sanford’s truck that night, he answered that “he lied because my truck was in Nashville. ”
Another incredibility is Tellis' claim that he knew Chambers for about two weeks.
Mobile phone records showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her contact data from the phone, as well as the texts and connections.
“ He removed her from his life, ” Hale said.
The final defense language is to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that probably the same day the case will be transferred to the jury.

Nanny from New York sues a couple for release after "racist" messages
The nanny from New York claims a couple for dismissaling her from racist work after receiving the wrongly addressed SMS, in which the mother of the child complains that she is a “neither black person”.
A couple denies as if they were racists, comparing the lawsuit to “shanting. ”
The mother of the two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly concentrated when the new guardian, Giselle Maurice, who was on the first day of work in 2016, was black.
“NEEE, THE WALKING BLACK OPERATION”, she wrote to her husband in her message.
But instead of sending him to him, she sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice by mistake.
According to the New York Post newspaper, when Plasco-Flaxman realized the doomed gaff, the “cracked ” released Gisella Maurice, claiming that the hearty nanny, who is Afro-American, had misconducted her responsibilities and was expected to be a nanny from Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice received the pay for the day of work, and then she was sent to the house of Uber.
Now it requires a couple of compensation for the release of $350 per day multiplied for six months, for which she was initially employed with residentiality, although she has not signed the contract.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," she said to the Post on Friday and added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple reiterates racism charges, claiming that the completion of cooperation with Ms. Maurice was justified because after she was insulted, they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent to her something she was not going to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Post's husband, Joel Plasco.
“Would you trust your children to the person you've regretted, even if this was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
In comparison with the lawsuit to “honour, ” Plasco said that his wife was born just two months earlier and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
"Do you intend to blow up something like that?
This is not too nice," added the investment banker.
Although the case in the court has not yet been completed, the public opinion quickly issued a few sentences in the social media, criticizing it for its behaviour and way of thinking.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington feared that the readers would not feel the relationship with the speaking mess
The author’s daughter, Michael Bonda, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after a warm book, says: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of a person who read it for the first time, before the book was published.
Now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success, it's funny."
She claims that her father, who, before a little blister inspired him to write a book for children, worked as a camera at the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected. She also adds that after his death last 60th anniversary of the book appears to be “sweet and bitter.”
The Paddington, described as “the very important member of our family, ” says that her father was secretly proud of his success.
“ He was a quiet man, he was not cheering, ” he adds.
"But because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who has achieved something -- you feel proud of him, even though it's not your credit.
I think Paddington's success has seen more than that.
Although he himself made it up and created it, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter landed, she was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nicea, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad called regularly and said it was really bad, that it probably won't work out," says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called to say that Natasha would die in two minutes, and I must say goodbye to her.
I did it anyway.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicinal products that the doctors gave her to maintain the heart attack slowly stopped and were expelled from the body.
She died a while earlier, and it was the end of all.
I could only sit and wait with awareness that all this is going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who was already grieving her daughter's loss, entered board with other passengers, unconscious of her torture.
“No one knew, ” she said.
I had a head down, and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but in the plane, I felt all kind of compassion for Nada.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women's mails in mourning are to help prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide are trying to distract others from their intention to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are placed on the Welsh bridge with inspiring news and phone numbers under which people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he was depressed.
“ I don’t want any parents to feel like I feel every day, ” he says.
A 45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, tells her son was a good cook with an infectious smile.
"All knew his smile.
They always said they could make every room clear."
But before he died, he quit his work because he was “in a really black place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old, and he found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the effect of the dominant."
Sharon Davis made cards to “be told people that there are people to whom you can contact and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit in silence, talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother died, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years.
“Nothing he said he feels sober, sad or anything, ” he says.
“A few days before God's Christmas, we noticed the change in his conduct.
On Christmas, he was already in a complete hole, and when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It is a hole in the family.
He's breaking us off.
But we must continue to live and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in Italian because the FBI is investigating
"I thought that if we were actually able to get what he asked -- the investigation limited timely and limited -- maybe we could achieve some unanimity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, and he added that he feared that the committee was "depleted" to the opposite camps leading to impass.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his republic advocates want to investigate the FBI?
They're all unwanted for a moment.
The elections to the Congress are within a few weeks - 6 November. If the Republicans lose them, the chances of choosing a person to the Supreme Court in the country are significantly reduced.
George W. Bush has already raised the phone to call the senators and encourage them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares a report?
A vote will be held in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently being held.
It's not sure if Brett Kavanaugh gets at least 50 votes of senators, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring it to the Supreme Court.
Under the Governments Kima, the number of refugees from North Korea is smaller.
According to the South Korean legislator since seven years ago, Kim Jong Un took power, the number of people fleeing from North Korea fell to South Korea.
Citing the data from the South Korean Ministry of the United Nations, Park Byeong-seug said that 1127 escapes were recorded last year and in 2011-2706.
According to it, the key factors that have affected this situation are more precise checks on the borders between North Korea and China and the higher rates taken by human traffickers.
Pjongjang has not issued a public statement in this regard.
The huge majority of refugees from North Korea is finally proposed by the citizenship of South Korea.
According to the authorities in Seulo since the end of the Korean war in 1953, the border has illegally exceeded more than 30,000 Koreans from the North.
Most people flee through China, which have the longest border with North Korea, which makes it easier to cross it than the closely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Koreans.
China considers refugees illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often sends them back to the country by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still in war, have improved in the past months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongjang, where talks were discussed on the denuclearisation negotiations that had previously stood in a dead point.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, which took place in June in Singapore, which is the result of a general agreement on the purification of the Korean Half of Nuclear Weapons.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of lack of progress in this matter.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security and there is no way that we unanimously disarma ourselves as the first," said Ri in the talk that he made before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugha "historic" and claims that he is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the Representation Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh “history” and said that it was not naturally suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these words during the interview she shared on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think that if a woman acted like this, she would be considered "historic," Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony that Kavanaugh made on Thursday before the Senate of Justice.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied charges of sexual abuse Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his preliminary speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — almost screaming and losing speech when he discussed family issues and high school years.
He also clearly chased the Democrats from the committee, determining the pregnancy charges “grotesk and coordinated attack on reputation” organized by the Liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi found that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was not suitable to work in the Supreme Court because he had revealed his prejudice to the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself by making these statements and by the way he attacked Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Asked if she would have tried to cancel Kavanaugh from the office if he had received a nomination and if the Democrats won most of the Representation Chamber, Pelosi had hesitated.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court but also serve in the court in which he is currently working," she said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the district of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as Democratic is afraid of Kavanaugh's possible judgments on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade process, because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the testimony of Kavanaugh, he skipped the question whether he would dismiss some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time to introduce a hysterical court, a predominant person who expects us to say "but it is wonderful," Pelosi added.
And women have to control her.
It's a good diatribe, months and years of anger, and she can't throw it out of her without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"It's pretty common, isn't it?"
She added: “A woman who was a manager in a company was a great help to me, and she said she was crying when she was angry, but she came up with a way that when she was nervous and crying, she said to the person with whom she was talking 'Surely you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad.
And he keeps doing his own.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are permitted as part of anger as they are incorrectly understood.
One of my apparent memories from one of the first jobs in the man’s office is how I began crying from an unreasonable anger.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think they're sad, and they're happy to have you baked."
Patricia Schroeder from the Democratic Party, then deputy to Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrawed from the race, frustrated to Patricia's borders, she realized that she could actually consider the idea of self-authorized candidation for the president.
“ It was not a thoughtful decision, ” she said, laughing at me, 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was the next.
Someone has described this situation as "King Snow and Seven Peanuts."
As the campaign lasted for a long time, Schroeder had a reluctance to collect funds, and she promised herself that she would not join the race if she didn't gather two million dollars.
It was a battle convicted to lose.
Then she discovered that some of her advocates, who gave men $1,000, had only 250 for her.
“ Do they think I have any discounts? ” she wondered.
During the talk in which she announced that she was not going to run a formal campaign, she was so full of emotions — appreciation for those who supported her, frustration because of the system that has so hardened the collection of money and turning to the voters, not the delegates, and the anger of sexism — that the voice bound her in her throat.
“I might think I've been through a nervous breakthrough, ” says the press's responses.
"You might think I'm sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they'll write on my grave.
'She cried?'
What benefits can be made to Beijing the economic war between the United States and China
The opening economic war between the United States and China were deaf and although the battle still lasts, the conflict between these countries may be useful for Beijing, the experts say.
The first warning was fired this year by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, putting customs on key export goods of China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new customs rates for goods of 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), which resulted in the taxation of the half of all the goods incurred to the United States from China.
Every time Beijing returned in nature, he recently raised customs to US goods worth $60 billion with five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every US strike, and it does not seem that the second economy in the world should soon fall back.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting demands, but public decline in front of the United States would be too disturbing for the President of China, Xi Jinping.
However, according to experts, if Beijing well plays its cards, the pressure resulting from the US trade war could in a long way strengthen China by reducing the dependence between both economies.
“The fact that the fast political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the disruption of economic chaos in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers have already been granted," said Abigail Grace, a researcher in Asia in the thinking tank Center for New American Security.
According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Syria is ready to return refugees
The government claims that Syria is ready for a voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding the country destroyed as a result of over seven-year war.
In his speech before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Syria Walid al-Moul concluded that the conditions in the country were improved.
"The situation in our territory is now stable and safer by progress in combating terrorism," he said.
In order to restore normality, the government is rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists all the time.
All the conditions already have been fulfilled that refugees who have to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic moves targeted in their daily life and maintenance measures can voluntarily return to it.
According to the UN estimates, more than 5.5 million citizens have left Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that Syrian regime would be happy to receive assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he emphasized that he would not accept the aid provided by the conditions or offered by the countries who sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals the Rider Cup victory in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the US team by 16,5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National field in Paris.
In the European country, the United States has lost sixth time in a row and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the trophy when under the leadership of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn gained 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who was not doing well through most of the tournament, hit the ball from the base right to the water of the 16th PAR3, giving Francesco Molinari the same game.
Italian golfist Molinari brightened through all rounds and became one of the four players, who since 1979, when this first time this tournament took place in the current format, it was successful to obtain the results of 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by 5&4 by the lowest classified player from Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the highest position in the world ranking, lost two holes before the last hole with the Englishman Ian Poulter, for whom it might have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The European with the largest wins in Ryder Cup was Spain Sergio Garcia, who took part in eight of these tournaments and gained 25.5 points of career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't stop myself today.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas that he believed in me and chose me.
I'm so pleased to get the bowl back.
This is the success of the entire team, and I am glad I could help," said the excited Garcia after the winning of the team from Europe.
He gives a stick to his nurse, John Rahm, who defeated a single American golf legend on Sunday, Tiger Woods, a result of 2&1.
"I feel amazing pride of winning with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all the games in France, and now he has the results of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
It's an unprecedented statistics, as for one of the biggest players of all times, who gained 14 of the most important titles and only declined to Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had all weekend problems with track finding, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing American composition, his captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point we pressed some Europeans this morning.
We're backing up.
The hats from the heads in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really good.
We will change the group, together with the PGA of America and our Commission on Ryder Cup, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud I can be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for the opponents.
They played a lot better than us."
