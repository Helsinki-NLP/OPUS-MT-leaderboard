The members of the Wales Assembly do not want to " go to the maps"
Among some members of the National Assembly, it is displeased by the proposal to accept the MWP abbreviation for their name (of the member of the Welsh Parliament, a member of Parliament of Wales).
The problem solution is about plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
The members of the Assembly of various political parties are concerned about the possible jokes with this accumulation.
One of the leuborists, expressing the view of his party, expressed concern about the rhythm of the new accumulation of Twp and Pwp.
For our readers, not from Wales: in Valley twp, it means "tooth" and pwp is "cacacka".
According to a member of the Assembly from the Wales Party, his organization was generally " dissatisfied" and proposed other options.
The Conservative Party “does not object” to the new abbreviation, but notes that the MWP is nearly written to the word Muppet (map).
In this context, letter w in the Valley language is referred to as an approximately as u in the Yorkshire English dialect.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently drafting a draft title change law, made the following statement: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly will be appointed will, of course, remain behind them.”
The Wales National Assembly of 2017 has been authorized to change its name by the Wales Law.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public review of the proposed options, according to which the option “Parlament of Wales” instead of the Assembly found wide support among the local population.
With regard to the appointment of the members of the Assembly, the Committee expressed its preference for the option “Members of Parliament of Wales” (Welsh Parliament Members, or WMP), while the MWP option received the greatest public support.
The members of the Assembly appear to offer other options, but to the Chairman, Elena Jones, it will not be easy to find a solution to all.
The reform laws will include other modifications of the Assembly ' s working process, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly will vote for the final option of their appointment during the draft debate.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the change in their country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians vote to rename the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The universal vote is called for to resolve a multiannual dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which its province of Macedonia exists.
The Government of Greece has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has been repeatedly objected to the entry of its northern neighbour in the European Union and NATO.
President of Macedonia, Georgi Ivanov, opponent of the referendum on the change of the name, said that he was not going to acknowledge his results.
However, referendum members, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, noted that the country's name was a total price for EU and NATO entry.
The Harlem Revenue Crisis: St. Martin's bell has shut up forever
“ The guards of the area I have communicated with said that there was a bar and a church earlier on each corner, ” Adams said.
“There is no one left.”
The extinction of bars can still be understood:
“Communications format has changed”.
“Bar ceased to be a kind of living room all over the area where they regularly visited.”
But as for the churches, it is concerned that the funds obtained from the sale of assets will be sufficient for a little while, whatever their leaders trusted. “ Early or later, they will stay with nothing.”
At the place of the church, he added, there will be a multi-party house whose residents are unlikely to support those stored in the area of arrival.
“The majority of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” says Adams. “ This will be near the day when such churches will close, because the new neighbours will never become their participants.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black area: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church 10 years later.
The first visitors of the Methodist Church abandoned the arrival of the 1930s.
Their building was redeemed by a black arrival located in the neighbourhood.
When the Church of St. Martina came into the hands of the black community, it was headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of stores on 125th Street, the main trading arteries of Harlem, where it was refused to be taken to work or to increase black people.
As a result of the fire, the building was significantly damaged, and during reconstruction work, Johnson's father's visitors ordered the installation of a carilon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, who replaced him at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the poor colonel.
However, the expert who tested the carilion in July otherwise called it “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical instrument”.
The expert from the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that the Karilion of St. Martin was the first tool in the world to play a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play a larger carilon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriguezer, the Church of St. Martin has not yet been replaced.
In the past few months, a complex situation with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by the world leaders of the Church, others by the episcopal Church.
The meeting, the arrival body of the world leaders, addressed the eparchy in July, expressing anxiety that the eryphia would “seek to translate the value of work” to the congregation, although the latter had nothing to do with the choice of architects and contractors directed by the Eparchio.
Some visitors expressed displeasure from the lack of transparency by the part of Eparhia.
In California, the shark wounded a 13-year-old diver who was inducing lobster grabs
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, a 13-year-old diver in California was attacked by the shark and suffered body damage.
The attack occurred about 7 a.m. near the Beacon Beach Beach Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told in the interview of the KSWB-TV station (San Diego), he dived with his friends on Saturday morning and heard about half an hour from the boy's screaming of help, and they flew the boat to the place of attack and pulled the teenager out of the water.
Hummel said that he first decided that the boy had a loud joy in the catch of a lobster, but quickly “whispered that he was screaming“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
Hammel observed that he had “a totally broken skin around the key.”
"I cried out that everyone would get out of the water, "There is the shark."
The boy was transferred to the Children's Hospital of Redi (San Diego); his condition was considered critical.
The type of shark attacked by a teenager is unknown.
Savior Captain Larry Gyles reported during the press briefing that a shark was seen in this place a few weeks ago, but it was not taken to dangerous species.
Heiles also added that the victim of the attack had been injured in the upper part of the tube.
The authorities have closed the beach area from Ponto in Casablade to the Swami beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Heiles noted that there were 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to conquer the cosmetic market of Great Britain
Seinsbury is going to establish cosmetic and perfume departments in Boots, Superdrags and Debenhams with cosmetic consultants, on the model of Luxury Universities.
The perfumerous cosmetic market of Great Britain is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings and continues to expand, while fashion and sales items are declined, and a significant share of this desired market as an experiment in 11 shops across the country will be presented by space cosmetics and parfumeries, and in the case of success in the next year will be expected in many other shops.
Supermarket owners are looking for a way to fill the boxes that have previously been placed under television, microwave caves, house-to-house goods, and investments in the parchum and cosmetic market are a good solution.
According to the representatives of Sainsbury, it is planned to double the assortion of cosmetic goods to 3,000 names, including the first time the marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be proposed.
The existing L'Oreal, Mordalline and Burt's Bees will be presented in a larger extent, in specially selected places, as the type of product organisation in Boots shops.
Furthermore, a company-based cosmetic linique will be reorganized with the transfer to vegan products to meet the requests of young buyers.
Two Sejnsbury stores will be presented by the parfly producer of Fragrance Shop: the first opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second opening is expected in Sally Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Internet trade and the trend of buying small amounts of food every day in small stores near home have led to the supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President of Sainsbury, said that the outlets would gradually become universages and the network of his supermarkets is struggling for buyers in competitive fighting cheap stores, such as Aldi and Lydle, offering more services and non-food goods.
In hundreds of Sainsbury supermarkets, Argos are located, and some of them are now able to find Habitats shops since the network acquired both brands two years ago.
The previous attempts of the supermarket to give a new life to their cosmetic and pharmaceutical offices were not successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint company of Seinsbury and Boots had been organized, but further disagreements had occurred in the issue of the segment of income from sales of medicinal products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury's sale of 281 shop, Selesio, owner of the Lloyds Farmaci network, for 125 million pounds of sterlings three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a broad line of luxury for care for the skin of La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
This is Paul Mills-Hix, commercial director Seinsbury: “We have fully transformed our appearance and atmosphere of perfume and cosmetic departments to create a more favourable environment for our buyers.
We also invited specially trained consultants who will always be willing to help the council.
Our marques assortment for any taste, a pleasant design and a comfortable place of shops will attract many visitors to search for cosmetic and parchment. This will be a completely new concept of the shop walk."
Peter Jones "anger" responded to Holly Willowby's exit from the 11 million pounds of sterling.
The Dragon Logo Star, Peter Jones, is "angered" by the exit of Holly Willowby's television from an agreement of 11 million pounds of sterlings, which she intended to conclude with Peter's lifestyle brand, but instead preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willowby doesn't have time for their joint brands of house clothes and axesurators Truly.
The business of this couple was compared to the Goop actress mark, Guinet Peltrou.
The 37-year leading programme, this morning, announced its decision in Instagram.
The decision of Holly Willowby to leave their profitable Leafstein Brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV, led Peter Jones, the Dragon Log Star.
According to our sources, Jones was “angered” when a television pet during a tense meeting held on Tuesday in his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, had admitted that after the conclusion of new contracts, it would not have enough time for their common mark of house clothing and accessors of Truly.
Their mark was compared to the child's actress, Guinet Peltrou, the Goop Mark, and its sales were expected to double increase the status of Willowby, evaluated by 11 million pounds of sterlings.
The 37-year-old chief announced her leave in Instagram, and Jones himself left Britain on a private plane towards one of his villas.
According to one source, “the Truly Mark was the main priority of Holly.
This was a long-term contribution that would provide her with care for the next few decades.
The decision led to the step of all parties to the transaction.
Everyone was amazed at what happened on Tuesday, since a number of weeks before the mark was launched.
The headquarters in Marlow remained a whole warehouse filled with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this “This morning”, one of the most popular stars of Britain, could cost the company millions of pounds of sterlings due to significant contributions to goods, from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as the potential delay in running the line.
It is also a matter of breaking up old friendly relations.
Three children who raised Willowby and her husband Dan Boldwin were friends with Jones and his wife Tara Cape for 10 years.
Willowby created a Truly mark with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, headed the company in March.
Both pairs have often been holidays together, and, in addition, Jones belongs to 40% of the company's TV production shares by Dan Boldwin.
Willowby will be the Ambassador of the M&S Mark and replace Anthony McPartlin as the leading ITV transmission.
The source of the closest environment of Jones said last night: “We cannot comment on his commercial affairs.”
Complicated negotiations, “Then we loved each other”
He joked about the criticism of the media ' s " inadequate president " due to the commentary and positive assessment of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Said Tramp by imitating the voice of the leading news.
"I did not renounce anything."
He noted that Kim Chen Yen was interested in a reunion, after Tramp called them the first summit held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards the reduction of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations of denuclearization have been impaired.
Three months after the June Summit in Singapore, the high-level North Korean diplomat Lee Yon Ho spoke to the world leaders at the UN General Assembly meeting on Saturday with a statement that North Korea is still waiting for “responsive action” from the United States after the initial disarmament measures of the CNDR.
Instead, the diplomat noted, that sanctions continue to be used as a pressure-cream.
During the meeting of his members, President Tramp expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“The case with North Korea is great,” he said. “
"We were on the edge of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have a great relationship."
Tramp said that his efforts to make relations with Kim Chen Yen had produced its fruit: the missile tests were ended, the hostages were released and the remaining in the CNDR are also returned to their homeland.
In view of his relationship with Kim Chen Yen, Tramp emphasized that there is nothing strange in his unusual approach to diplomacy.
“Leave yourself suitable to the president so easy, but then, instead of 10,000 people on the streets who strike into this entire hall, there would be only 200 people," Tramp said, pointing to the crowd gathered before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destructions, victims are calculated by hundreds of
In the first days after the earthquake in Lomboc, the foreign NGO said that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had lost a roof over its head, the Government did not find it necessary to announce the national natural disaster, which is an obligatory condition for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not need international support, and therefore it was difficult,” said Selina Sambung.
The Rescue of Children is preparing the team to be sent to Palo, but we still don't know if a foreign group can work at the place.
According to the statement by Mr. Sutopo, the official of the National Office for the Elimination of Natural Disaster, Indonesia ' s leadership conducted an assessment of the situation in Palo to determine the appropriateness of international organizations.
Given the persistent seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains very badly prepared for natural disasters.
Although there were hiding from tsunamis in Acheha, they were rarely encountered on other coast lines.
Despite the warning on the threat of tsunami, there was no siren in Palo to inform the population, which likely led to so many victims.
Transport message between many Indonesian islands is quite difficult even in good weather.
Scientific disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The swimming hospital, previously bound in Lomboc to assist victims of earthquake, is sent to Palo, but the road to the place of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joco Vidodo has strengthened Indonesia's large infrastructure as the main point of his pre-electoral campaign and has spent undecided funds to improve roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Jocco, who has been balloting for a new time next year, has disturbed financing problems.
The President was also criticised for the enmity of the inter-faithful hostility between the Conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands have lost blood as a result of conflicts between Christians and Muslims, armed machete, arrows and other self - shots.

The monument of Cromwell before the parliamentary building raised a strong discussion on the “Rewriting of History”
Cromwell ' s expulsion would be a retribution for the barbaric destruction of many cultural and religious artefacts of England by his followers, puritanian fanaticians.
However, Mr. Creek's memory community called Mr. Creek ' s proposal " madness " and " trying to overwrite history " .
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “In the ongoing debate on historical monuments, the statue of Oliver Cromwell before the Westminster Palace was inevitable.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the icon-borce movement during English civil wars.
Probably Oliver Cromwell suffered from his ancestor Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thornikroft reflects the view of his contemporary in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still consider to be respectable.
In the interview with the Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmith, “many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell a parliamentary protection against external pressure, in his case monarchy.
If this view is historically precise, it remains a debate for professionals.
But it can be confident that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has affected the future development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical person representing one side of that section.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve high assessment and respect."
The Chinese farmer has been sucked by a swine killer
In one of the South-West China markets, a farmer became a victim of pig, reports local media.
The victim's bleeding body (the media only refers to his name, Yuan), with a broken arteries, was discovered next to the market in the Lupańschou province of Guyjjou in South China, reported on Sunday.
The pig pig is preparing to introduce pigs in the pig farm, 30 May 2005, the Sinin of the Chinese Province of Cinhai.
Juan and his cousin arrived from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs to sale.
The next morning, the cousin discovered Juan’s breathless body, and the door to the neighbouring pig was opened.
There was a huge blood cream in the pig.
During the medical trials, a pig was found to be a crushed farmer with a weight of 250 kilograms.
“My brother's legs were bleeding and crushed, ” said Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the killer.
The video from the surveillance camera showed that Juan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The pig killer didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the pig was isolated in a separate crew during the investigation, to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that the Yuan family has negotiated with the market administration on compensation for the death of a farmer.
Incidence of pig attacks on humans is not frequent.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in the US state of Massachusetts, severely traumatizing a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogramm animal put a Valley farmer into the tractor and released it, just frightening the grown woman.
In 2012, a farmer from the state of Oregon in the United States was eaten by its own pigs. As a Canadian farmer told the CBC News channel, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the blood taste can act on their hidden aggression as a “launch mechanism”.
"The pigs of play,
They are biting and very curious, but they have no purpose to hurt you.
You should simply raise your animal's feeling of measure and respect," he explained.
Uragan Rosa will bring lives to a large part of the Southwest of the United States
According to the predictions, the hurricane of Rosa is losing power through a colder water zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, in the next few days, it will bring limbs and floods in the northern Mexico and south-west of the United States.
As at Saturday, 5 hours a.m. in New York, the cyclone reached the 1st category with winds to 135 km/h by 360 km south-west of Punta Euchenia (Mexico).
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure zone will be formed above the Pacific, which will move east to the west coast of the United States, and near the coast of the Low California state, the storm will bring tropical moisture to the north of Mexico, south-west of the United States.
More than 25 centimeters are expected in Mexico on Monday.
The tropical moisture in the low pressure zone is expected in the coming days in the Southwest.
The drops from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous floods, dirty streams and possible deserts in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, the high tropical moisture of air can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In individual areas of South-West, mostly in the Arizona Territory, up to 5-10 centimeters are expected.
There is no risk of sudden rapidly developed floods due to the unbalanced distribution of tropical rains.
With the existing risk of the tropical leaf, walking in the desert is serious.
The linings can turn canyons into rainfall rivers, and the thunderstorm can cause the seats of the winds and raise the clouds of dust.
The low pressure zone in the Southern California coast will disturb the lions.
It may fall up to 1,5 cm, which may cause small dirty streams and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
These are the first descendants from the beginning of the rain season in the region.
On Sunday evening and morning, on Monday and morning in Arizona, tropical rains will take place in other territories by Monday night and Tuesday morning.
On Tuesday, the leuvenes will pass in the area of Four corners and will be extended until Wednesday.
In October, there will be rapid temperature drops, due to low air temperature in the Arctic, with sufficiently high temperatures in tropical tropicals.
Sometimes such a combination leads to severe temperature drops in small territories.
Such sharp temperatures will be particularly observed in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
Between the temperature in Kansas City (Misuri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and DeMoines (Iowa) have a difference of almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the summer heat will be accumulated and distributed into other territories.
Most of the central and eastern territories of the United States are expected warm weather at the beginning of October, the temperature will reach 27 degrees in the area from the Southern plains to the North-East of the country.
In New York on Tuesday, air temperature may rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees higher than the average.

Senate hearings in the case of Judge Bretta Cavano have seen more than 20 million observers
Brett Cavano and Cristina Blazi Ford, who accused Cavano of the attempt of rape, completed in the 1980s, had drawn attention to more than 20 million viewers of six television channels on Thursday.
The political opposition to Cavano's candidate has received an unexpected renewal. On Friday, the media reported that the Republican Jeff Flake had provided the condition that the prosecution of a lawyer would be investigated by the FBI for a week.
As Ford stated at the hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she was “100 per cent” convinced that Cavano had attacked her in a state of drunkness and tried to separate her at the school party.
Cavano made emotional testimony, claiming that 100 per cent believed that it was not.
According to the research agency Nelsen, more than 20.4 million viewers were discussed on Friday.
The Agency took into account the average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of other channels such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network are not yet available.
Furthermore, the Nelsen rating does not always take into account the viewers watching the TV at work.
For comparison: this is a medium audience watching the American football match in playoff or the Oskar's pleyoffe ceremony.
The largest audience was in the Fox News Channel, whose leaders were hotly supported by Cavano's appointment: the senate hearings, which lasted all day, looked at the average of 5,69 million viewers, reported the Nelsen Agency.
Secondly, ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audition amounted to 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, the MSNBC viewed 2.89 million viewers, while the CNN had 2.2 million views, reports Nelsen.
After hearing, the interest in the case was not weakened.
There was a real drama on Friday with Jeff Flake.
After the Senator of Arizona, who was considered a moderate republican, reported his intention to support Cavano candidature, CNN and CBS television were able to seal the camera on Friday morning on the way to the Legal Committee, Flake met in an elevator with a group of activists who disagreed with the senator's criticism.
The whole world saw him falling off his eyes getting anger from angry women on CNN.
“I stand before you, ” said one of them.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?"
“The power behind you, while many women are inpowered,” they tried to explain their position of women.
Flake replied to the activists that his office had already made a statement, and he would speak at the meeting of the committee, and the elevator doors closed by hiding a senator from everywhere.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee prepared to approve Cavanaugh's candidature for the post of the judge and to send it to the Senate for a general vote, all television channels broadcasted the meeting directly.
Flake, however, provided one condition -- to investigate the FBI on the charges against the candidate by the next week, as a democratic minority was pursued.
Flake claims that he changed his views by the intervention of a friend, a senator from the democrats, Chris Kuns.
He made a final decision by talking to Kuns and several more senators.
Flake's decision had taken effect, as it was obvious that the Republicans lacked votes to approve Cavano without investigation.
By order of President Tramp, the FBI opened an investigation of charges to Cavano.

Police officers distracted the protesting individuals of independence, while the last, clothed in black masks, was throwing the guards with eggs and dust paint, raised the clouds of dark dust in the centre of Barcelona.
After the police released the dab to keep the crowd, the riots renewed with the new force.
During a few hours, the independence party scanded, "We will not forget, not forgive!", and their opponents answered them with a sloung: "Let Spain live!"
According to the local press, fourteen shareholders were injured in a hospital with light wounds.
On 1 October last year, a referendum on the exit of Catalonia from Spain was recognised by the Spanish Government, but became an important separatist, and a year later, in the sovereignty of the region, tension remains.
The catalonia voted for the exit of Spain, but the phenomenon was low because the exit opponents were mostly bojcotted by the referendum.
According to catalan official sources, in the past year, in attempts to block the country's electoral referendum in severe collisions, nearly 1,000 people were injured.
On Friday, separatists stayed on the outlined route of the demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from being conducted.
The demonstration was still happening, but it went the other way.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narciss Termes, who visited the separatists in his wife's company, finds that the hope of acquisition of the Catalonia of sovereignty is increasingly faint.
“Lately, one of the most important events in our life has happened.
My parents cried for happiness by having the opportunity to vote in a referendum, and today we are in a hungry state," he said.
At the recent December elections, the catalan parties in the local governance authorities, who have been separated from Spain, have received an important victory, even though with a small impact, but this year their movement is lost by the participants, since many known leaders of the movement are either running or detained, waiting for their role in the organization of a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Pouch, a 42-year-old mechanist who recorded a phone meeting in support of the police, said that the conflict was heated by both parties of the political spectrum.
“The tension is increasing,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junkeras, one of the nine leaders of the catalan separatists, since the end of the last year of the preliminary imprisonment, said that his intention was to ballot to the European Parliament next year.
“The participation in the European Parliament's regular elections as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government,” he said.

Livingstone victory over Rangers thanks to the bullet naked Mengi
The first goal of Dolly Mengi brought a guaranteed victory to the Levingston team
For the chief coach of the Scotland Club, Steven Gerard, it was only the second defeat for 18 games.
The exact impact of Dolly Mengi equipped Gary Holt's team with the Hybernian club in the recording table where they share the second place.
Gerard's Club has lost its victory in the season of Premier Liga, and they are meeting with the leaders of the group, Harts, from which the Rangers are eight points.
On Thursday, the Rangers will take the European League match with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vina).
The Livingstone Club continues its inadequate series in the Division, playing six matches and no defeat since Holt changed Kenny Miller as the chief coach of the team.
Missed moments for Livingstone in struggling guests
Coach Coach Holt was supposed to be accounting from the beginning, and “rendgers” clearly did not deal with their efforts.
Scott Robinson was able to break through the defense line, but the naked of his weak attempt, and then Alan Litgow's protector, swing too wide, couldn't interfere with Keig Halket's ball.
The host party allowed the Rangers to play before their protection line, counting on dangerous moments when the game was resumed.
That's exactly how they missed this important goal.
"Rangers" dropped a free strike, and Livingston used the possibility: Declan Gallagher and Robinson broadcasted Menga, who was in the central position.
At that time, the Rangers had a superior ball, but the administering team was inconvenient, so Liam Kelly's gateway was not concerned.
The second time continued on the same scheme, although Kelly still had to hit Alfredo Morelos.
The Rangers gateway Allan McGregor slipped the ball from Scott Pittman, and Litgow made a broad delivery from the standard position.
The balls were constantly ripped into the Livingstone Penalty, but all the attacks were reflected, and the two toolstones requirements were one for the provocation of Glenn Middlton Halkett and the other in the game of hand were not satisfied.
“The phenomenal” game Livingstone — Analysis
From BBC Scotland — Alasder Lamont, reporting with the Tony Macaroni Arena stadium
Fenomenal game and excellent outcome for Livingstone.
Absolutely all players were brilliant and again overcome all the expectations by continuing their rising on the football Olymp.
Their games and composition style have almost changed since they risen up to top lines of rating, and the greatest credit for Coach Holt was that he had mobilized the team from the beginning.
There were many real heroes in his team.
Captain Halkett led greatly organized protection, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall relax.
The Rangers could never get into the rhythm.
Although they had good game moments with Coach Gerard, this time they did not justify our expectations.
In the last minute of the game, they had no ball ownership, but only one time they were able to protect the host team. The Rangers, who had fallen in the middle of the table, have something to think about.
Erdogan's cold reception during the visit to Kelne
On Saturday, 29 September, when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast, there was a great weather, and both higher people were in a great mood.

In the same place, the opponents of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, also gathered to condemn, in full, both the Erdogan policy and the decision of the German Government to invite him to Germany with a visit.
The presence of radically contrary views at the meeting reflects the unequivocal substance of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots are exercising Erdogan, while others consider it a tyrant.

Uragan Rosa could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (to benefit from dry territories)
Arizona rarely falls into the intense tropical cycle zone, but this time she was “happy”: in the beginning of the next week, hurricane Rosa, with the last rig, should go over the desert part of the South-West and take the risk of floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned about the threat of liquor floods on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and South and Eastern Nevada, in the southeast of California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The hurricane of Rosa is expected to go straight over Phoenix on Tuesday and powder on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service Bureau in Phoenix reported in Twitter that “the only ten tropical cyclones had maintained the status of tropical storm or depression from the radius of 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
The hurricane of Katrina (1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border."
According to the recent projections of the National Meteorological Service, it will fall from 5 to 10 cm, reaching the places of 15 cm at the Arizona Plato of Mgollon-Rim.
In other desert regions of South-West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basein, a drop of up to 2,5 to 5 cm, the landings may reach 10 cm.
For zones that will be passed by the rain of the hurricane of Rosa may be a true blessing, since the region has long suffered from drought.
Although the floods may be dangerous, rich rains may facilitate the dry season not in the Southwest of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40 per cent of the Arizona Territory is observed by at least a strong drought (second by weight)," weather.com reports.
First, the hurricane of Rosa will fall into the State of the Lower California, Mexico.
As at Sunday morning, the hurricane, the maximum speed of 137 km/h, is 360 km south of Punta-Euchenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Uragan was found in a colder zone on the Pacific coast and thus lost its strength.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico as a “tropic storm”.
It is expected that there will be plenty of floods in Mexico.
“In the Territory of Lower California to Northwest, Sonora may fall up to 7-10 cm of landing, with areas up to 25 cm," said the weather.com website.
Furthermore, the hurricane of Rosa will go north across Mexico and will reach the border with Arizona on Tuesday in a tropical cycle, and from Arizona it will come to the south of the Utah state by Tuesday night.
“The basic potential risk associated with the hurricane of Rosa and its remains relates to strong limbs in the Lower California, in the north-western part of Sonora and in the desert regions of the Southwest of the United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
The landings are expected to cause dangerous floods, dirty stone streams in the desert and possible landscapes in mountains.

Donald Tramp: "All hatred, all evil" of democrats has struck in Cavanaugh"
“The voting for Judge Cavano is a voice against the ruthless and ruthless tactics applied by democrats” said Tramp at the meeting of his colleagues in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Tramp, the Cavano nomination of the candidate was “failing all the hatred, all evil” of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Cavano testified in the United States Congress, categorically rejecting Cristina Blazi Ford ' s prosecution that he had sexually harassmented her over 30 years ago when both were adolescents.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her accusation.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that that day “the American people saw a brilliant mind, class and courage”.
“The vote for the approval of Judge Cavano is a vote for the approval of one of the most excellent lawyers of our time, with an uninterrupted public service list,” the President announced the crowd of his associates in the Western Virginia state.
In his speech, the President indirectly touched the issue of Cavano nomination, referring to the importance of the phenomenon of the Republicans for elections in Congress and the House of Representatives.
“To the most important choices in our life, only five weeks remain.
I am not participating in them, but I participate in the race in a different way," he said.
"I am wearing like a worm and fighting for our excellent candidates."
Tramp believes that the democrats have given themselves the challenge "to give us all the strength to resist."
Under the Regulation, the first key vote in the Senate for the Adoption of Cavano candidate should take place not later than Friday, the Assistant of the High Representative of the Republican Party reported.
The earthquake in Indonesia has suffered hundreds of lives and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people died, many of the giant waves abducted by the beaches of the Indonésian island of Sulavezi, which had been destroyed by the incredible tsunami force and earthquake.
The first victims of the season were hundreds of visitors of the beach festival in Palo, and on Friday, at the sunset, the waves reached altitude of almost six meters, which dared all in their way and led to the immediate death of many of the present.
Tsunami followed the earthquake of 7.5 by Richter's scale.
“When the storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach rest instead of running into hiding immediately and lost their lives," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, official representative of the Indonesian National Office for the Elimination of Natural Disaster implications during the press conference held in Jacarda.
“The tsunami did not come through the water, cars, brews, whole houses, the nature destroyed everything on its way” Nougroho explained, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean with a speed of 497 km/h, and the coast has fallen all the way.
Some of the present ones came to the trees that saved their lives.
Approximately 16,700 locals were evacuated into 24 shelters in Palo.
The aircraft of the control of natural disaster impacts are seen by devastated homes, shops that have crashed bridges and flooded mosques.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still underground.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory with 2.4 million people.
The Statement of the Agency for Evaluation and Use of Technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the energy emission caused by the earthquake was approximately 200 times higher than the explosion of the atomic bomb destroyed by Hiroshim.
Tsunami may have been stronger than expected by the geographical situation of the city located at the end of the long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “maximum”, adding that thousands of houses, hospitals, trade centres and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found under the ruins of destructed buildings; total injuries were received by 540 people, and still 29 were missing.
Nugrocho added that the victims and destruction could be even more significant along the coast of 300 km from Palo, in a place of Dungala, which was closer to the earthquake.
Communications with Dungala were "destroyed fully, no information has been made."
The International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already been headed into the disaster zone, reports: “The region of Dungala is more than 300 thousand people,” the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers are already in the area of disaster.
“The tragedy has occurred, but it is not yet limited”, states the report.
On Saturday, the Office has been criticized because it has not reported the tsunami to Palo in time, but the authorities believe that the waves had reached the coast at the time when the initial warning was still in force.
Social networks found a lover video where a man on the top floor of the building screamed about the coming tsunami, desperately trying to draw attention to people on the street.
In a few minutes, the wall of water will be destroyed, carrying all the houses and cars.
The Reuters agency has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this film.
The earthquake and tsunami have led to a major degradation of electrical lines, which has led to the loss of communication in Palo, which has made the rescue operations very difficult.
From Jacarda and other cities, military transport planes were sent with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still lacks food and the objects of the first need, state government sources.
The city's airport was only opened for humanitarian assistance; it would be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, the evacuation centres will be visited by President Joco Vidodo.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision were safely arrived from Dungala to Palo, where the staff found a hiding in the beneficial tents broken in the court of their office building.
“They have seen a huge crowd of devastated houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
The charitable organizations began to engage in humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that international NCO experts were unable to reach Palo.
The Indonesian legislation authorizes funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign organizations to be financed only after an announcement of the location where the nature was hit by a national disaster area.
That's not what happened yet.
“It is considered to be a local disaster”, reports Aulia Ariani, press secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the Government declares the natural disaster to a national, we will be able to receive foreign assistance, but the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that hit Palo, the friends and relatives of people who are missing still hope for their wonderful salvation, which will restore their faith to the best.
On Saturday, a little boy fell into the sewer gateway.
On Sunday, the rescueers pulled out of a woman who spent two days there near her mother's breathless body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of national Indonesian paraplanerism, prepared two of the missing pilots for recent Asian games in Indonesia.
Among other people who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his disciples, including Mandagi.
“I am not the last person in this sport, and it is emotionally difficult to survive, ” he said.
Gendon recalls how when Roa Roa Roa was acquired from other paraplanetists, he desperately tried to contact whatsApp with his colleagues from Palo on the beach festival for the next hours.
However, his messages were displayed with one grey gallon, not two blue ones.
“This means that the communications were not delivered” he said.

Kanie West: the rapper has changed the name on Ye
Rapper Canye West has made a new name: Ye.
He announced this on Saturday in Twitter: “The personality known earlier as Kanie West.”
41-year-old West has been wearing this alias for a long time and even put it in the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The news of this appeared in the predecession of Canya in Saturday Night Live, where he plans to introduce his new album Yandhi.
Canye West will speak to the convicts instead of the singer of Ariana, who revoked her participation for " emotional experiences " , the transmission author reported.
West previously claimed that the alias was not only a short version of his name but also a religious sense.
“Ye is the most frequent word in the Bible, it means you, you, ” so West explained the name of his album in one of the recent interviews to the Big War Radio.
"It is me, it's you, it's us.
At first, it was Kaniea, which means “one, ” and now I am just Ye, which is the reflection of all good, bad, unacceptable in us, just at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are."
Canyo is not the first known rapper who decided to change the name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Daddy, P. Diddy, or just Deeddy, asked this year to call himself Love (Love) or Braza Love (Bracia Love) or Brother Love).
The West Rapper J.Z. also changed his name several times: with defis and without, in the letters or short.
President of Mexico solemnly pledges not to use military forces against civilians
Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore never to race against civilians at the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration ending with a blood-proliferation.
Speaking on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Square, President Lopez Obrador promised that “will never be able to help the army to suppress the Mexican people”.
At this point, on 2 October 1968, during the peaceful demonstration, the first shots in the crowd were launched and 300 people were killed, which was in the background of the strengthening of the left student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador also promised the support of Mexican youth as a monthly scholarship for education and opening a larger number of free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the absence of education lead young people directly into a criminal world.
USDs need to double the financing of II developments
China and its efforts in artificial intelligence (II) should not be underestimated — the United States should double investment in its scientific development, Lee Kaifu, investor and entrepreneur in the development of II with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
A number of American ministries have previously made statements on the II work, although in the entire United States there is no clear strategy for the development of I.I.
At the same time, China has presented its own plan last year: its goal is to become the first innovation by 2030.
“Increasing the II research budget would be a good start twice, taking into account that all other countries are far away from the United States and we expect the next breakthrough in the field of II”, said Lee.
Increased funding could double the chances that the next major achievement of the II would be made in the United States, said Li CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “The super-State of Art Intelligence: China, the Cream Valley and the new world order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the Director-General of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most excellent II companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence at the University of Carnegie Mellon, which exceeded the highest player in the American Hotel, and then he was head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned the previous US Government Technology Competitions, such as Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would take place to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have a lot of work to receive government grants.
“China does not absorb academic leaders but corporates,” convinced Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have been hiring lights from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to develop artificial intelligence.
"I think the Green Cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published an artificial intelligence plan for the next generation.
The Chinese National Natural Scientific Fund allocates funding to scientists similarly to how the National Scientific Fund and other governmental organizations allocate money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China below, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the United Nations Ministry of Defence established a United Nations Centre for Artificial Intelligence, in which partners from industry and scientific circles should participate, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
During this month, DARPA announced the investment of $2 billion in a programme called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it is currently investing more than 100 million dollars a year in the II study.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislation, which has endeavoured to establish the Commission for National Intelligence on Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any measures in this direction for several months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether the country ' s name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday at a referendum on whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would allow a multiannual dispute with Greece, which blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, consisting of the province of Macedonia, claims that its name of the northern neighbour is a claim in its territory, and put veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on the proposal for a new name, but the opponents-nationalists claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the phenomenon of the voters would correspond to the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The issue on the referendum was as follows: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU under the conditions of adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Participants of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries arrived after the breakdown of Yugoslavia, is worth paying that price for entering organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that she could live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska, Skopje, resident.
Insufficient numbers of members of the parliament have stated that they would comply with the outcome of the vote to make it decision-making, although it has no mandatory legal force.
Amendment of the title will require a majority of two thirds of the votes of the Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 1:00 p.m.
However, the phenomenon was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the recent parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters were voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško voted for a referendum in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country, which would open the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage, putting chairs in front of the tents established by those citizens who are going to bounce the referendum.
"We are for membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a highly raised head rather than robbing the thresholds of official offices," Kavadarkov said.
“Yes, we are citizens of the poor country, but we also have a sense of dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can address other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring investments to Macedonia, which were so necessary for that country, where unemployment was more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the over 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zeev said after the vote.
He believes that the positive response will become “the guarantee of our safe future”.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies showed that 30 to 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the referendum, but it was below the required phenomenon.
During the second survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV channel, 57 per cent of respondents were planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of that quantity claim to vote positively.
In order to make a referendum, the phenomenon should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious impact on the policy of the Western Government since it came to power in May last year.
See: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City is circuating the protection of Bryton to slap the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling argued with the protection of Bryton, bringing Manchester City to win on Saturday 2:0 at the Thesehad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero put a goal on the 65th minute, it seemed like it didn't make him work.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a passage in the center of the field.
He was walking between the three Briton Protectors before exploding into the open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green shirts.
He circled over one defender and circled a few more on the edge of the Briton fine zone.
Then he handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English attacker, in a fine zone, returned Aguero's ball to the right leg by the Bryton gateman, Matthew Ryan, to the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs”, said coach of Manchester City, Pep Guardiola, journalists.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he's stuck the naked at the moment."
But Sterling has given the Sky-Blue primary advantage in the fight of Prime Minister Liga.
That naked was 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero received the ball deeply in the territory of Bryton
He gave an excellent cut-off on the left flag to Leroy Sana.
Sune made a few touches before transferring Sterling to a further stamp.
The Sky-Blue attacker stuck the ball into the gate right before flying outside the field.
The Manchester City struggled with Hoffenheim at the League of Champions on Tuesday 12:55 at Rein Nekkar-Arenne, Zinzheim, Germany.
Shercer is going to take the Colorado Rokiz glasses.
After Washington Nashionals had emerged from the playoff battle, there was no special reason to force events.
But the intimidated Sherzer hopes to conquer Colorado Rokiz on Sunday, but only if Roxie has one game in Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division, there will be problems in playoff.
The victory of the Nashionals on Friday night, Rokiz, at least 7 or 8 seats, was already conquered, but they were still hoping to ensure the title in the first division.
“Although we play just so, at least we can keep the positions, knowing the great importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of the observers and the other team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss this?"
Naschionals have not yet announced a beecher on Sunday, but, according to the latter, they are inclined to put Sherzer on the role.
Sherzer, who was going to go out on the 34th game, thirty-fourth time throws a ball on the pitcher field, and on Sunday, on his weekend, he will be a pitcher.
Statistics of the "Washington" prosshi statistics – 18-7 with ERA 2,53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
Tramp runs a pre-electoral race in Western Virginia
Recalling the importance of the phenomenon of the Republicans at the interim elections, the President indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Cavano, a candidate made by the President to the Supreme Court.
"All we have done is placed on the map in November.
Five weeks remained to one of the most important choices in our life.
It's very, very important. I'm not running, though I'm really running, fighting for good candidates everywhere," he said.
Tramp continued: "You see this horrible, horrible, radical group of democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using any necessary means, and we see the violentness and disgustingness.
They don't care whom they will insult, whom they have to cross, to receive power and control; that is what they want to receive: power and control, but we are not going to give them."
Democrats, he claims, have aimed to “resist and obstacle”.
"And you have observed this in the last four days," he said, "the democrats are evil, malicious, ill, and liar."
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Finstein, which led to loud voices from the hall.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the contents of this document to elude?
Mmm... mmm... what document?
No, no, the tongue of the body has issued it, and I have never seen the language of the body to deny the words so much."
The Laborist Party is no longer an organization that follows different views.
It does not show tolerance to those who express their views
When the Momentum activists in my local party offered me a voice of mistrust, it was not unexpected.
Finally, I am the last member of a number of parliamentary members of the Laborist Party who has not yet been conveyed that we are not welcomed for expressing our views.
Similar attitude to my colleague in the parliament, Joan Ryan, because it was strongly expressed against antisemitism.
In my case, I've been criticized for disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe is ironic about fate is the issues Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Laborist Assembly notified on Friday that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the time from eight years of my residence at a local member of Parliament from the Laborist Party, the Friday meetings of the GC were the same.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not in conformity with many meetings, but the promise of “wilder human and soft” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that the Laborist Party does not distinguish in views becomes more and more obvious, and each opinion is assessed by whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; my colleagues, whose political perspective I had previously considered similar to my own, began to expect me to change my views and take positions that I would never agree, whether the issue of national security or the single EU market would be.
Each time after my public speech -- no matter what I'm saying -- the social networks call for annulment of the elections condemning the Centre's policy, or claiming that I should not be a member of the Laborist Party.
And that's not just what happens to me.
Indeed, I know that I have been more lucky than some of my colleagues, since the comments on my address still have a tendency to be political.
I admire the determination of my colleagues, who every day face sexual or racist attacks, but never retreat.
Most of all, this policy disappoints the number of insults that have become considered normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin stated that the Laborist Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the "wide church" and with every votuum of mistrust or change of the rules of choice of the party, it is now.
In the last two years, I received many recommendations that encourage me to sit quietly and cut out and then I will be fine.
But that's not why I came to politics.
Since I joined the Laborists 32 years ago, as a student of school, disregarded by the Government of Tatcher, which has literally dissolved my school class, I have endeavoured to stand up to the highest standard of public services for those who need them most, whether the work of the local deputy or the government minister.
I never hid my political views, I didn't do it in the past elections.
No one in Notting East could have interpreted my political positions and spheres in which I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who supported this vocuum on Friday, I would like to say this: our country is working hard to move to Brexit, which guarantees that it will cause an economic, industrial and public injury, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and strength on my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to speak to is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they are labs or not: I am proud of what I serve you, and I promise that no threat to canceling the results of the election or political use will prevent me from acting as I think necessary for your interests.

ER 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible E.R.
Two late attempts may have erected some of the final outcome, but the E.R. certainly deserved a triumph in this incredibly interesting contestation of the Premier Liga of Tenenta.
They are now heading the table, the only unbearable team of dozens.
Finally, thanks to their excellent protection and the ability to choose the right time, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merci the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested for strength all this time, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad," Peter Mercy commented.
Robin Christy, Melrose: “They are better than us.”
The 14-minute attempt of Grant Anderson, performed by Fraser Climo, led the ER forward, but the yellow card released for the game Voriors to the Scotch player Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to move forward, and Jason Baggott caught an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased the E.R. from the penalty before, directly in the middle of the game, earned a point, and then made a single attempt in the interruption by making 17-5 for the benefit of the E.R.
But Melrose started the second half well, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, which was done by Baggot, decreased to five points.
There was then a long break due to the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, who received a stretch, and after re-exit, the E.R. continued with the attempt of Stafford McDowell, acquired by Climo.
The current Captain Blair McFerson then received the yellow card, and Melrose again forced the rivals to pay the next player for the unreasonable attempt of Bruce Colvin at the end of the rage pressure period.
Nevertheless, the masters returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for Climo's capture without a ball from the fine line, McFerson made a tachdown behind the next E.R. moll.
Climo realized the advantage without stopping practically from the most re-exit, after Kyle Row got hit by David Armstrong and sent the extreme attacking Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the masters of the field.
The Still Game Star is going to start a new career in a restaurant business
The Still Game Ford Kyran aims to work in the hotel industry: it was known that he was appointed a director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, the scenario he writes to, and is taken off with a long comedian partner, Greg Hamphill.
Duett announced that the forthcoming ninth series would be the last in the show, and it seems Kirnan is planning life after Craiglang.
In official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan planned to participate in the “prosperous restaurant” in Glasgo.
Our Sea: There is no way to the Sea of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Navy patrols the headquarters in La Pass.
Blue flags are hanged in public buildings.
Military bases from Lake Titicac to Amazon are drawn by a slogan: “The sea is our right.
Return it is our debt."
In all Bolivia, without a sea, still alive memory of the coastal line lost for Chile as a result of the 19th century ' s bloodshed conflict; live and desired to swim again across the Pacific.
These hopes may have become the most brave in the past decades, since Bolivia is expecting the international court's decision, which will take place on 1 October during the five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, the spirit of unity and the mental balance and, of course, there is a positive result," said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many of the Bolivians will observe the decision-making process in the International Court on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will be able to support the statement of Bolivia that after decades of tense negotiations of Chile has been obliged to negotiate the provision of sovereign access to the Sea of Bolivia.
Evo Morales, charismatic President of the Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia, who is taking a difficult battle for re-electing next year, is also awaiting with anxiety the decision to be made on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court would hardly decide in favour of Bolivia, and if so, it would not change much.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to order the Chilean territory and has already stated that it would not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The decision of the International Court was made only six months after the latest arguments were heard, states that the case was not "complicated", said Pas Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
In the last four years, the case of Bolivia has not progressed but has been delayed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has been using the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes” says Zarate.
She said that the military rhetoric of Morales destroyed the last Chile's kindness.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
These two countries have no diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodrigues Welce, representative of Bolivia in Hague, disagreed that the court's decision was made too quickly.
The Monday will offer Bolivia “exclusive opportunity to start a new era of relationship with Chile” and the chance to “do the end of 139 disagreements with both benefits”, he said.
Calcadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, uses the maritime problem as a political cosier.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access to the Pacific,” he said.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to make sure that we need to cross our past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not be available until it can trust the United States
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yon Ho, stated that his country would never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons unless he could trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the UN Genassamble meeting.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made at the Singapore summit between its leaders.
His comments are made as the Secretary-General of the United States, Mike Pompeo, gradually returned to the path of renewal of the tummy nuclear diplomacy for more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Chen Yen.
Ri claims that the dream that the long sanctions and objections of the United States against the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever kneel the North is a drowning.
Washington fears to endorse this declaration if Pyenyan first takes substantial disarmament steps.
And Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Tramp, want to take the second summit.
However, the scepticism that Phenyan seriously refers to the denial of the arsenal, which is likely to be considered the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Tramp.
Paris Fashion Shows the latest line of massive main clothing that promises to appear in mass sales and will be carried right next to you.
If you want to add a hat to your collection or protect yourself from sunlights, there is no need to look for anything else.
Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a mass of unusual main clothing, part of their SS19 collection and blind fashion visitors in Paris.
This summer, extremely irregular hats conquered the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their creative works to the stage.
The valentino copie: the main beach suit, decorated by wide fields similar to feathers, was decorated on the heads of the models.
Other massive axes have included precious stones of archa, a wizard hat, and even an ananas, but all these main clothings are not intended to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also revealed the world a collection of creepy masks, which had to be very much before Halloween.
Many of these famous masks were sewed up, and they were more like Hannibal Lector's portrait than the drawer.
One of the copies looked like an ice cream swimming equipment with a pipe and protective glasses, and the other was a distanced ice cream.
If you're a high fashion fan, you're lucky.
Fashion criticians predict that these huge hats have all the chances of breaking into mass sales right to you.
The huge hats go on the La Bomba fifths, a slammed hat with the fields of width two feet, which were all wearing, from Rianna to Emily Ratakovski.
The Cultural Label, which produced this extremely irregular hat that conquered such widespread popularity in social networks, produced and sent to walk on the floor another huge axesuar, a sacred beach bag, almost the same large as the model dressed in the bathtute.
The orange bag from a burned raphia with a white skin handle and a raphia canvas became a bright copie of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris.
The selebrity-stylist Luke Armitaz tells the F. .: “I think the large hats and beach bags will appear in the mass sale in the summer. Since the designer has produced such a furor with its works, it would be very difficult to ignore the demand for huge axessoares.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance for citizens of the world
Independent schools of Scotland continue the tradition of brilliant education, which has been reaffirmed in 2018: the outstanding results of the examinations showed individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other public-significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scotland Board of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are trained throughout Scotland, and they are seeking to provide higher services for students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further acquisition of higher education selected by their career and for the status of the world citizens.
As part of the educational sector responsible for the development and implementation of the individual school programme, we see that modern languages continue to remain popular and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in the language he understands, you call to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own tongue, then you turn to his heart."
This is a convincing evidence that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relations with other citizens and can trust them.
According to the recent tests this year, we see that languages are taking leadership positions in the league tables and have the highest score in the results of the independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received a higher assessment of “A”.
The data received by 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students received “A” in mandarin (Chinese language), while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of Spanish and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received “A”.
This proves that in independent schools of Scotland foreign languages are definitely vital for children and young people in the future.
Language subjects are currently demanded as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and other educational institutions.
A study conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of linguistic skills had been lack of language skills among the causes that caused employers to difficulty in filling vacant jobs.
Thus, linguistic skills are increasingly a guarantee of a successful future career for young people.
Given that more prospective jobs require language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession a student will choose if he learns the second language, he will receive real advantage in the future by gaining another additional skills that he will be useful for his entire life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages competitive advantages.
According to the YouGov survey, in which more than 4,000 adult British participated in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak in a foreign language enough to support the conversation, and the French was the only language with a bidder per cent — 15 per cent of respondents were spoken.
That is why investing in language education is so important now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children more chances to find good work.
In Scotland’s schools, there is a sufficient disturbance in languages that are trained — each school has a set of languages.
A number of schools are focused on more classical modern languages, while others are teaching languages that are considered the most important to Britain in the light of the future development of the country before 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child are, independent schools will always be chosen from several languages with a teaching composition whose members are professionals in these languages.
Independent schools of Scotland strive to create an environment that will prepare children and arm them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of their future.
At present, it cannot be denyed that in the global business environment languages remain vital in the future development of the country, and that should therefore be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to propose that choice that will provide diversity and benefits for youths of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards, Director of the Board of Independent Schools of Scotland
Lebron debuts on Sunday in San Diego
The thorough expectation of fans to see Lebron James speak at Los Angeles Lakers for the first time was almost over.
Lekers Coach Luke Walton announced that James would play a pre-second Sunday match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But we still have to figure out how much time he has to play.
“More than one and less of the forty-eight,” said Walton at the official Lakers website.
The Lakers Reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play a limited time.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games in the Lakers graph.
“In this stage of my career, I do not need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” the player answers.
Trampo race in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting the emotional meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five Tramp meetings next week, including the friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on the candidature proposed for the Supreme Court of Justice was deferred, Tramp seeks to provide support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans risk to lose control of the Congress if the vote takes place in November.
What time will Tramp meet in West Virginia tonight, and how can you view it online?
The meeting with Tramp in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held at 7:00 p.m. today, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Tramp meeting with the Western Virginia electorals online on the direct broadcast on YouTube.
The Tramp will probably speak in the hearings that took place this week for the promotion of his candidate, Brett Cavano, to the Supreme Court of Justice. The proposal by Tramp of that candidate has caused a mass of negative responses, since Cavano was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote that had to take place in the Senate will be delayed until the week before the FBI was investigated.
However, the main goal of this share is to help the Republicans in November elections increase the pre-election rate.
Thus, the campaign of President Tramp aims to ensure that these five meetings, which should take place next week, help “activating volunteers and parties, since the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” says Reuters.
“Control of the Congress is so important for its agenda that the President should visit as many states as possible, as we enter a tense season of pre-electoral agitation,” said the Press Secretary of the Trampa Pre-electoral campaign, who refused to be called Reuters.
Wesbanco Arena today in Wiling can attract participants from "Ohajo and Pennsylvania" and attract the attention of the media of Pittsburgh," reports West Virginia Metro News.
The visit to the Tramp of West Virginia on Saturday is the second visit to this state in the last month, because this is where it has received the advantage of more than 40 per cent in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help a candidate at the Western Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisi, who is postponed by surveys.
“The fact that Morrisi should be here in order to initiate survey competitors is a bad sign for Morrisi itself,” said Simon Heather, politician from the West Virginia University (Reuters).
Rider's cup 2018: The United States Assembly demonstrates its readiness to combat and hopes on Sunday for couples
After three unilateral sessions, the Saturday game two to two may have been exactly what the Ryder Cube needed.
The transitional initiative is an extraordinary sports concept, but it is the one in which players believe, and in such competitions it is very strongly expressed.
So who has an initiative?
"They have had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I believe it is a small initiative for us," Jordan Spit said when he left.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and another twelve on the line.
The Americans say that Speath feels "the wind in sails" and they have reasons to keep the spirit high, not in the latest because of the form of Speath and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each can praise with three points of four.
Sleep was unprecedented from you to the grin, as he set a personal example.
The winning voices were increasingly loud as the round continued, putting the decisive ball into the hole by closing the match when Thomas and I retired two to two.
His strike, which gave them a victory in the 15th hole, was faced by a similar voice, one of those who said his faith in the opportunity for the American team.
“It is necessary to gather with all the powers and focus only on its game”, commented Speech.
That's all the players left now.
Go through 18 holes and become winners.
The only players who have earned more scores in the last two days than Speath and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who have certainly entered the history of the Rider Cube.
A strange, but charming couple in Europe exploded four of the four, and they seem to have no knowledge of errors.
Mollywood was the only couple who had not taken the godgy on Saturday day, but they also avoided the Godgy on Saturday morning, Friday day, and again, Friday morning.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and the uncertain guests, strengthens the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun hides behind the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous player that has strengthened the potential victory of Europe than Flitwood or Molinari.
It would be great if they were both on different holes at the same time.
However, to speak about the glory of Europe so far early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson argued with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four balls when he was in a couple with Alex Norren.
Boggi and two double godgs in the first nine holes dug the Spanish and screwed the hole that they could never get out of.
So on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your jam.
It is so interesting to observe the game in four balls and four players because of the interaction between couples, the advice they exchange and which intentionally silence and how the strategy can change into one moment.
Europe has played better as the team, and has a significant advance on the last day, but the fourth session has also shown that the United States Assembly has all forces to combat, in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day, the Rider Cube Europe leads with 10-6 accounts
Europe will receive the vigorous advantage of the final day of the Rider Cube after the end of the Saturday matches in four balls and four with the advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duet Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari fought two victories against the fighting Tyger Woods to bring the account in Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wished to return the trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the error of the American team in the morning games in four balls, defeating with account 3-1.
The United States has made more resistance in fours by wining two matches, but they have not been able to reduce the breakdown in the account.
Jim Ferrick's team takes eight points from the 12th Sunday matches to save the trophies.
Flitwood is the first European newman who won four points in a sequence, while he and Molinari, who received the name Mollywood after the sensible weekends, became only the second pair who won four points in the first four matches in the history of Cube Ryder.
By demolishing Woods and Patrick Reid in four balls, they then remarkably joined to win the desperate Woods and the American new Brison Dechebmo with even more decisive 5/4.
The two Saturday matches showed periodic flashes, but now he lost 19 out of 29 matches in four balls and seven balls.
Justin Rose, who rested before the morning game in four balls, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in four, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kapka with the account of 2/1, taking the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, however, the game has not been a easy and pleasant journey to the southwest of Paris.
The three-fold champion Jordan Speath and Justin Thomas made two points on Saturday.
They earned a decisive victory with the account of 2/1 of the Spanish, John Ram and Ian Polter, in the game in four balls, and returned later to win Paulter and Rory Macilroy with 4/3 in four, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Rider Cube, the team was pulled out in four points, leaving alone, taking into account that the Ferrick team, as the masters, had to play innocently to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of retention of the second seat, the contratact appears to be beyond their capabilities on Sunday.
North Korea said that “categorically” would not be disarmed unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions strengthened the lack of confidence in the United States and that his country would, under no circumstances, not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yon Ho stated at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “relevant measures of goodwill” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the demonstration of the nuclear polygon and the obligation to not build nuclear weapons and not develop nuclear technology.
“The same symmetrical response from the United States is not observed,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to take unilateral action on disarmament.”
While Ri reiterated the current North Korean complaints against Washington ' s " phased " approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for the steps graduated, its statement seemed important in the sense that it had not rejected unilateral denuclearization without control, as Phenyan had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Yen and Donald Tramp at the first summit in history between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader held in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start a movement towards the “Danuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and Tramp promised North Korea to guarantee security.
North Korea has attempted to officially complete the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States claims that Phenyan should first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes appeals to weaken severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“U.S. insists that “the denuclearization must be produced” and increase the pressure level through sanctions to compel their goal and even object to the “conclusion of war”,” said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can kneel us is a utopian dream of people who don't know us.
But the real problem is that the continuing sanctions strengthen our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Tramp, mentioned by the United Nations leader at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister focused on three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Mun Jee Yen, who had been held in the past five months, and added: “If the question of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a trauma.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was sharply different from last year when he said in the UN Genassample that the targeting of North Korea's missiles to the United States was inevitable after the “Mr.
This year, in the United Nations Tramp, who threatened the “destruction” of North Korea, commended Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that there is much more to do and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is disarmad.
On Wednesday, Tramp said that it did not mean any timetable for this process: “Whether it takes two years, three or five months, it doesn't matter.”
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should encourage Phenyan for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The introduction of the Security Council of sanctions must continue actively and in coercive order until we see a complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, endeavouring to terminate the financing of Phenjan programmes on nuclear and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN Genassambla Summit and reported after that meeting that he would visit Phenyan again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Phenyan, saying that progress has been made, but for a few hours after that, North Korea's visit convicted him for “bandit requirements”.
North Korea pledged to demolish the missile complex and nuclear complex, if the United States had taken appropriate measures on its part.
In his words, Kim told him that the “relevant measures” he said were the security guarantees that Tramp promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are learning to rest in special courses
The new course introduced at the Harvard University this year helped all students to learn more to sleep and to fight the Shovinist culture of continuous consumption of cafein in order to awake "nights in the spring".
One academy found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Clinic, developed a course that he believed to be the first in the United States.
After his opening was made, he was burnt with the idea of introducing such a course, prior to the report on the lack of sleep on the learning processes.
"And at the end of my report, a girl came to me and said, "I'm very sorry I've learned this only now that I'm almost finishing my training."
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — what surprised me,” said the Telegraph.
The course, first proposed to students this year, tells us how healthy sleep habits contributed to academic and sports performance and how it improves the overall self-esteem.
Paul Barrayra, a psychiatric professor of the Harvard Medical School and executive Director of the University Health Service, said that the university decided to introduce this course after it was discovered that students experienced a serious lack of sleep during the school week.
It lasts one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
One section offers a picture of a room in a room where students, pressing on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books, receive information about how each of these actions and substances — coffee, lights that also cause a lack of sleep — affect sports results, and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In the second section, participants will learn how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, infarction, depression and cancer.
The interactive map of the campus encourages participants to think about their daily life.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students at once.
But we believe that they have the right to know, like any other person has the right to know about, for example, how smoking affects his health," added Professor Chasler.
He said that the false feeling of pride for the person being able to “smell all night” remains sufficiently widespread, and modern technologies, as a growing pressure on students, means that the deprivation of sleep becomes a problem.
He said that sufficient sleep of good quality is a “secret weapon” of a student to combat stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to combat overweight, as the lack of sleep translates the brain into the hunger regime, making him feel hunger constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studyer of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaseler to develop a course last year, visiting one of his first years in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to disseminate this information throughout the campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all asspirants to take a similar training program before entering a competitive school.
Professor Chassler recommends that students set up a wake-up wake-up wake up and remember the harmful effects of the blue light, displayed by electronic screens and light lamps, which violates human biorrhythm and leads to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga is winning Gerard's team
The Rangers survived the next sad trip meeting, since the goal of Dolly Menga led the unselfish team of Steven Gerard to defeat with the account of 1:0 in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team was hoping to win its first victory after the 4.1 victory in February in St. Johnston, but the team of Gary Holt only defeated Gerard of 18 games, leaving his team at eight points behind, giving a light victory to the Harts team, the leaders of the Scotland Prime Minister Liga.
Menga screwed up seven minutes before the break, and the composition of the Rangers, who lost the power of the spirit, seemed to have not planned to equip the account.
While the Rangers now descended to the sixth place, Livingstone rose to the third place, and only the Hybernian resigned on the ratio of the heads slaughtered.
And the Rangers may have additional problems after the linear judge Calum Spence had to heal a head wound after a subject was abandoned from the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements in the team that passed through the E.R. in the half-final for the Scotland League Cube.
In turn, Holt went with the same Levi Strategy 11, which led to increasing the breakdown with Harts last week, and he would be pleased to see how his well-edged composition of opponents had been tightened at each step.
The Rangers may have been led by the sword, but Livingston has squeezed much more when the ball hit them.
They were only supposed to be stabbed in two minutes when the first transfer of Meng Scott Pittman was stopped by Alan McGregor, but the semi-protector took advantage of the possibility.
Kigan Jacobs had a fine attack on Craig Halkett's captain, but his defence partner, Alan Litgow, was only able to send a ball to the next stang.
Rangers took over control, but in the last third, there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he and Steven Loules had to be punished for forty-fifth minute, but Judge Steven Thompson disagreed with the Colombian statement.
The Rangers had only two hits in the first time, but the former Aibrox gateway, Liam Kelly, had barely been concerned about the blow of Lassan Kulibali's head, and the weak blow of Ajaria.
Although the first goal of Liby, which was at the 34th minute, may not match the game, no one can deny that they deserved it exclusively by their own work.
But again, the Rangers failed to manage Jacobs' game from the standard position.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who was trying to transfer the ball to Menga to complete.
Gerard began to act in a break when he switched Culibali to Ryan Kent, and that replacement was almost immediately resulting when the extreme semi-protector gave the passage to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly flew from his line to capture.
But Livingston continued to involve guests in the game they were designed with Litgow and Halkett, making long-term transfers.
The Holt team tried to increase the concluding phases, but McGregor was able to block Jacobs before Litgow gave the transfer from the corner of the field.
The reservation player Rangers, Glenn Middlton, repeatedly demanded a punishment after he struck Jacobs, but Thompson refused again.
Almanah: Inventor of Geiger Computer
And now the page of our almanah "The Sunday morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Gaiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactiveness — a design that eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger's calculator.
As one of the basics of science, Gaiger's computer also became one of the basics of popular culture, which was reflected in the 1950s Coloccola Coronado film, with cowboys like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, which would seem not like scientists in the main roles:
A man: “What is this thing?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s calculator, used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear these earrings, you can really hear the impact of atoms produced by radioactiveness in minerals."
Evans: "Here, I'm sure I'm hearing!"
Gaiger died in 1945, not only a few days before his 63-year-old.
But his invention, named by his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” anonymous cells
A new vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” anonymously growing cells and kill them.
Part of the vaccine treatment is to teach the immune system to identify anonymous cells
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and to change them in laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, cells are able to “see” the type of protein characterized by many types of cancer, and then cells must be reinstated.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One patient who has entered this vaccine and whose immune system has learned to identify anonymous cells, the cancer of eggs has been in remission for over 18 months.
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and to change them in laboratory conditions, after which modified cells can “see” HER2 proteins characterized by many types of cancer, and the modified cells are reinstated to the patient.
Professor J. Berzofski, United States Institute for Cancer Research, Vitez, Maryland, stated: “The results that we received are suggesting that we have a very prospective vaccine.”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “inspires the growth of several species of cancer”, including breast cancer, eggs, light and colorful cancer.
The similar method has been successfully used in the treatment of leukemia, and it was in the immune cells of patients and their “training”, as should be affected by cancer cells.
Canye West was defending Tramp in the MAGA hat after his appearance in SNL.
It's gone bad.
Canye West was whistled in the studio during the Saturday concert on which he expressed his view to the protection of the President of the United States, Donald Tramp, claiming that he would take that post again in 2020.
Following his third song called the City of Ghost, which he was carrying on the hat “Do America a great again”, the executor spoke with the speech against the democrats and supported Tramp.
"I talk to white people very often, and they ask me, "How can you support Tramp, is he racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America for a long time," the executor said.
The SNL channel made a parodial show with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood Star laughed at the testimony of Brett Cavano before the Senate for Statement of Cristina Blacey Ford.
On television, it has not been shown how the crowd was upset by West's statements, but this video was loaded into social networks by Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock tried to make West laugh.
West also complained to the public that he was laughing at his hat behind the towers.
“They were kidding me behind the scene.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They were really kidding me!
Washington Examiner quotes his words: “They also said that my position is not cool.”
West continues: "Do you want to know what is not cool? Wear a superman's coat so that no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to develop?
Then you need love."
His comments, at least twice, were drawn to the audience, the members of the SNL actors seemed distracted, and one person said to the publication: “The entire studio was swimming in silence.”
Westa was invited to replace Ariana Grande's singer, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller, died a few days before.
Many were confused by the West of the Love It song in the bottle costume.
West was supported by the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candis Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the most brave people: HAPPY for the support of many people.”
The leader of the show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was just "the one he is, and it's absolutely great".
"Surely, I don't want to support anyone (buying his music, clothing or somehow supporting its creativity) who, I think, shares and disseminates the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she said.
Before the show, the reper announced in Twitter that he changed his name, saying that he was now “formally known as Kanie West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Deedy's steps, also known as Paff Daddy, Paffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Doga, originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and as another example, could, of course, bring the performer who recently became a legend, the Prince, who changed his name into a symbol and then to the artist name, known earlier as Prince (Prince).

Kit Harrington's throne Game Star attacks toxic masculine
Keith Harrington is known as the sword of John Snow in the cruel medium-century fantasy series HBO The Game of thrones.
Nevertheless, a recent 31-year-old actor criticized the stereotype of macho hero, saying that such characters often indulge young people to think that you must be cruel in order to respect you.
In his interview with the Sunday Times Culture Keith, he said that he believed that something had gone wrong, and asked him how to solve the problem of toxic masculine in the age #MeToo.
Keith, who recently married his colleague on the Royal Games, Rose Leslie, his peers, admitted that he was “believable” to this problem.
“I personally take this question very seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of courage?” the actor asks.
“What do we teach adults that we have this problem today?”
Keith believes that television can be partly guilty of this toxic courage because of too much muscle characters.
The Actor continues: “What is born and what acquired?
What are such teachings on TV and streets that make young men feel that they should show only one side of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems in our day, and the question is, how can we change it?
Because today with young people, really, something's wrong.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be participating in any trails or sequels of the Games of thrones, after the series ended in the next summer, saying that he “finished the batalities and horses”.
Since November, Keith will play a major role in the re-reflectoring Real West, Sam Shepherd, who tells about the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The acter recently declared that he believed that the meeting with his wife Rose was the best final of the Games of thrones for him.
“I met my wife at this series, so he gave me my family and the further life,” says the actor.
Rose played Igrist, the object of the passion of the character of Keith John Snow in the fantastic series of Emma's rewards.
The couple noted the wedding in June 2018 in the family of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14 per cent increase in new cases
China announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its HIV and AIDS citizens.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people in the country have these diseases.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
In an overwhelming majority of new cases of disease, sexually transmitted, which indicates that the trends of the past have changed.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly spread in some areas of China as a result of transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections was almost zero, stated Chinese health representatives at the Yunnan Province Conference.
The number of people with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 per year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a sharp problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminated in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT was still widespread.
Studies confirm that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90 per cent of men who have sexual contact with men, they eventually marry women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is responsible for insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of the efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Watters objected to information on the leak of information on the guilt of the Senators of the Republican Party, complaining of “dangerous lies” and “theory of conspiracy”
Member of the United States Parliament, Maxin Waters, on Saturday rejected the charges that one of its staff had provided personal information to three United States Republican Senators on the Vikipedia legislative pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that lawsuits have been faked by experts and websites.
“ Lying, lie, and even more bad lies, ” says Waters in his Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes the home addresses and numbers of United States Senators' phones.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person in the Capitolian Hill during the hearing in the Senate Commission on Objections against Sexual harassment against the candidate to the Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano.
The escape took place a while after three senators were interrogated by Cavano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of messages, was linked to the Watters office and published information on Watters staff, reports Hill.
“This unfounded allegation is absolutely false,” warns Waters.
“My staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraud acts, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is a complete lie."
The Watters statement immediately criticized the Internet, including the former press secretary of the White House of Ari Flaysher.
“This is angerous denial,” says Flaisher.
"That means that the author has a temperament not suitable for work in the Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why are you angry?
And you don't have to be justified either.
And the motives of the prosecutors should not be digging.
We must remain calm and cold."
Flaysher seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of democrats against Judge Cavano, who was accused of being too angry during hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republicans who balloted for the Watters at the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts in Twitter.
“If this is true, it is very important,” he writes.
Watters stated that her office warned “the authorities and the law enforcement authorities of these frauds.
“We will make sure that the criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions that may be destructive and dangerous for all and every of my staff.”
Johnny Englez hits again — a weak parody on the spy of Rowen Atkinson
Today, it was a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which Britain is represented in some way; this also applies to the new parodious spies of the Agent Johnny Englez, which started in 2003 and continued with the "Agent Johnny English: Reload" film in 2011.
Will the self-ironic painting of the leitmotive "approximately we're all shit" become a new attempt to national export?
In any case, the profane of Johnny Englez with a rubber face has received its right to chaos for the second time — that is the most brightest name that it is a broad-screen comic art for the non-English film audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent, who, despite his impressive claims for the glamorous railway, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bean's characters, and the portion of the guy who brought one note to the Chariots of Fire in London 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympiada.
The character was originally created on the basis of the traveller and the mysterious “International” Atkinson, who once played in the forgotten now-forgotten Barclaycard advertisement, in which the hero was left full chaos after it.
There is one or two pleasant moments in this latest issue of JE.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in the medium - century garments, and the shoes crawled on his helmet.
Yes, it shows the gift of Atkins to the physical performance of the comedian scenes, but the humor itself seemed quite weak and strangely excessive, especially because such "serious" films, such as "Agent 007" and "Incomplete Mission", are now confidently proposing a comedy as a element.
It feels like humor is based on children, not on adults, and I feel like Johnny Inglisha's remarkable offences are not as inventive and suitable as Atkinson's jokes in Mr. Bine's movies.
The Permanent Ambassador is now the fact that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker broke into a secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horrors of the defence agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, had an episode role.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, an exhausted and hard figure that has already suffered of enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the quazi-Tereza-May character, but there is nothing to work with.
Her Intelligence Advisers informed her that since each active spy was compromised, she would have to get someone out of resignation.
And this is the scene of Johnny Englez who is currently working as a school teacher in a pont office, but also gives informal lessons of secret operational work: there are several good jokes, since Englez proposes a spy academy in the "roc" style.
Englez returns to Whitehall for an emergency instruction and reconnects with his former unavoidable friend Buff, who is also played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man who obeys the commander of the submarine boat is the role of "happy hockey sticks" in which Vicki Pepperdin is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game because her Majesty's secret service has made terrible mistakes.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is in danger of charming the charming of a charming technological billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems, the creepy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Baf start with a dissej of fars jokes: masked under the waitress, they burn the French restaurant; they create chaos, smuggling themselves on the luxury yacht of Volta; Englez produces a complete anarchy, trying to use the visual reality chamber to get to know the inside of the Volta house.
All these scenes, of course, are a sweet and awkward idea, but there's something really childish in all of this.
Completely moderate things.
And, as with Johnny Inglish's other films, I couldn't stop thinking: can the British movie industry not give Rowen Atkinson a really proportionate role to his talent?
Laborists deny that they are developing a British work week reduction plan to four days for five-day salary
The Laborist Party, Jeremy Corbina, will consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week, but the payment will be paid in five days.
The Party, reportedly, wishes that companies managers give savings to workers as a result of artificial intelligence revolution by providing them an additional weekend.
This would allow staff to enjoy the three-day weekends for the same salary.
The sources reported that the idea was “incorporated” into the economic agenda of the Party and helped the population to become on the side of workers.
The Professional Congress approved a four-day working week to allow workers to benefit from the benefits of the changing economy.
The high source of the Laborist Party said: The Sunday Times is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen at the same time, but the four-day working week is our goal that corresponds to the approach of the party to change the balance in the economy for workers and the common industrial strategy of the Party.”
The Laborist Party is not the first to support the idea, since the Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its pre-electoral campaign in 2017.
However, this aim is currently not approved by the majority of the Laborist Party.
The representative of the Laborist Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party's policy and is not considered by a party.”
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a conference of labourists last week to define his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take the power out of the " no-like directors " and " speculators " of communal companies.
The Shadow Officer's plans also mean that the current watercane shareholders may not return their entire share, as the Laborist Government can make “accounts” on the basis of alleged offences.
He also reaffirmed the workshops of the company directors and the establishment of funds for Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10 per cent of the private sector capital to workers who will be able to receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 minutes" whether the FBI investigation on Cavano can change their views
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Cavano has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court of Justice for at least a week and asks whether the findings of the Agency could encourage any of the Republican Senators to support Cawano.
In the interview shown on Sunday, the correspondent Scott Pelly, “60 minutes”, interviewed the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, whether the FBI could find anything that would make them change their views.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“ Of course, ” Kennedy replied.
“ When I went to the meeting, I said that I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after that, and the information came up, and I asked, ‘ Did you do it? ’
His response was decisive, definitive and unanimous."
But Graham's opinion remained unfair in the vote.
"I have determined firmly on Brett Cavano, and my opinion can be changed only by arguments, by the power of action comparable, except with the dynamite," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I know is that Brett denied all of this firmly," Graham added, turning to Christine Blacey Ford.
“None of the people she called as witnesses could also confirm these facts.
This story has been 36 years.
And I have not noticed anything new in it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be held in New York by the Global Citizen Festival (The Festival of Citizens of the World) — an annual musical event in which an impressive star composition with a not less impressive mission — the end of poverty throughout the world.
It is the seventh year under the World Citizens Festival as tens of thousands of people are gathering for a large meal of the Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performance of Janette Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, as well as to discuss the current goal of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which was opened in 2012, was the continuation of a global project to combat poverty, which was conducted by the international human rights group to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it actively.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you are not ready to pay VIP tickets), you had to participate in voluntary activities or send an email to the world's leader, make a phone call or perform any other or other significant action to help raise awareness of your goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the World Citizens Festival become for 12 years in order to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea of a free visit to the concert to convince the constituents to call for action, or is it just another case of so-calctivism when people believe that they make real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages on Twitter?
The Global Citizen organizers claim that more than 19 million “actions” have been registered on the festival since 2011 and have been pursued by its participants.
It is recalled that the world leaders had promised to allocate more than $37 billion, which should affect more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group made 390 commitments and announcements made by its action, at least $10 billion of which have already been paid or collected.
According to the group, the funds provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important obligations is the name of the Power of Nutrition: the British partnership of investors and Implementation Professionals committed to “help the children to fully reveal their capacities”, promised to provide Rwanda $35 million to help to put an end to minority in the district. This was done after more than 4700 Twitters received from the Global Citizens participants.
“With the support of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and Global Citizens such as you, we can make social injustice regarding the insufficient food of past history”, said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Panel also stated that, after more than 5000 actions have been taken to encourage the Britain to improve food for mothers and children, the Government announced the financing of the “Feed Force” project, which will cover 5 million women and children through activities designed to improve food.
In response to one of the often asked questions on the festival website: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen’s organizers answer: “This will be a long and difficult way where we will be stumbled and falling from time to time.
But as in the great movements of the fight for civil rights and against the apartheid, we will be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Vikend, Sean Mendez, Cardie B, Jeanel Mone, are some of the artists who will play this year in New York and his leaders will be Deborra Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
US can use the marine fleet to prevent the export of Russian energy: the Minister for Interior
U.S. Minister for Interior, Ryan Zinke, said that Washington could “as necessary” escape the assistance of its maritime fleet to prevent the impact of Russian energy operators on the market, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that the presence of Russia in Syria, especially where it acts on the invitation of a legitimate Government, is a suggestion for the study of new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy as they do in Eastern Europe, in the south of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to address this problem.
“United States together with our fleet are able to ensure the openness of the seaways and, if necessary, the blockade to prevent their energy from entering the market”, said the Minister.
Zinke addressed the Consumer Energy Alliance participants, a non-commercial group, who sees itself as a “loss of energy consumption” in the United States.
He further compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“Economic Strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less effective use and replacement of fuel”, said the Minister, calling Russia “pony with one trick”, whose economy depends on the fuel that was dignified.
The statements were made because the Tramp Administration had given its task to increase its burnt natural gas export to Europe by replaceing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this, Tramp administration officials, including US President Donald Tramp, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “inappropriate” project of the North Stream-2, which, according to Trampa, has made Berlin a “hunter” of Moscow.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly emphasized that the North Stream 2 project was worth 11 billion dollars, which should double the existing circuit skill capacity up to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kreml claims that Washington's irritation was due to economic reasons and is an example of inadequate competition.
“I emphasize that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to select suppliers”, said Russian Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with the US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has caused a negative response to Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the face of the Federation of Germany's Industry (BDI) called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes with our supply of energy, this creates a serious problem” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German industry Federation (BDI), after the recent meeting of the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel and Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Senator from the state of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine the possibilities of ballot for the President in 2020
Senator from the state of Massachusett Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that it would be careful to examine the possibilities of balloting for the president after the interim elections.
At the urban thought meeting in Hollioca, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider taking part in the pre-electoral race.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and "fix" our broken government, and for that "top" needs a woman," says Warren The Hill.
" After 6 November, I will carefully consider the possibility of presidential ballot."
Warren appreciated the activities of President Donald Tramp during the meeting: “The district will lead in the wrong direction.”
“I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open criticism for both Tramp and his candidate to the Supreme Judge Brett Cavano.
In his Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, we need to investigate the FBI before we vote.”
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most of the voters of Warren themselves do not think that it should be balloted in 2020.
According to the survey of the Centre for Political Studies of Saffolk University/Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of the "probably" voters of Massachusetts stated that the senator should not ballot.
Thirty-two per cent of the respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The survey showed that the population had more support for the former Governor of Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported its possible participation in elections and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known names of democrats discussed in the 2020 prospect include the former Vice-President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden claims that he will take an official decision to January, reports Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin told me about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Paylin at the meeting with the voters of Donald Tramp
Track Paylin, 26, joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
“My son, who has returned home, is now suffering the same thing as the other family who experiences the effects of PTSR and the injuries and our soldiers return with injuries," she said at the meeting with Donald Trump in Talsa, Oklahoma.
Paylene called him "the bulm in the eye" and said about her son and other war veterans: "They are already returning to other, scattered, asking, and whether the same respect is shown to their companions, soldiers, pilots and any other military that they have shown to their country."
Track Paylin was arrested on Monday in Vasille, Alaska, and was accused of family violence against a woman, interfering with the situation of violence and arms storage in the state of alcoholic alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the representative of the Vasilla police department.
18 States, Colombia County, support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian district support the legal contradiction of the new United States policy, which prohibits the asylum to victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and district submitted analytical note from the Court on the support of the asylum beneficiaries.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Court of Grace against Sessions, issued by the American Union of Civil Freedoms in August against Federal Policy, is not declared.
The woman claims that her civilian husband and his “sons in a criminal group” had been subjected to ill-treatment, but the US officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
Attorneys supporting Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have made a large number of asylum applications in the United States as countries facing widespread crime groups and domestic violence.
The new policy of the United States asylum provision has cancelled the decision adopted by the Appeals Board of Immigrants in 2014, which allowed immigrants without documents saving from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The General Prosecutor of the Colombia District, Carl Rasin, stated on Friday that the new policy “is ignoring the decades of the application of public, federal and international law”.
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and that prohibition violate this principle”, states the advisor ' s report.
Advocates also argue that immigrant policy is harmful to the United States economy, emphasizing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce”.
In June, the General Prosecutor Jeff Seshns ordered immigration judges not to provide asylum to victims saving from domestic or gang violence.
“The asylum will be provided to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or on political beliefs,” Sashns said in his statement dated 11 June.
This instrument has never been designed to address all the problems, even the most serious people faced every day in the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palo: the number of deaths is doubled in search for survivors
The situation has become increasingly difficult for survivors.
“Now it's very difficult,” says 35-year-old Reese Kusum, who comforted her sick child in the evacuation center of the destruction of the city of Palo.
“Each minute, an ambulance brings the wounded.
Pure water in a large deficit."
Inhabitants return to their destroyed homes, dig into wet things and try to save everything they can find.
Thousands of people were injured, and 0.5 were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Dvi Harris, who had a spine and shoulder break, were rested at the army hospital of Palo, where patients were treated openly because they had to leave the room because of the continuing strong pressures.
He cried, remembering how a strong earthquake destroyed the hotel room on the fifth floor that he took off with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I was stuck in the shape of the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had arrived to the city for the wedding.
“ I heard my wife screaming, asking for help, and then the silence came.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they have saved themselves and now they are all right."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of " attacks " by " advertising "
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a daily American publication of advertising on four pages declaring mutual benefits from trade in the United States and China, US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of the use of the American press for propaganda.
The President of the United States of Iowa, Donald Trump, in the past Wednesday, referred to the pay supplementary of Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper issue of the State of Iowa, to file charges against China in attempting to interfere with the United States Congress elections, which would take place on 6 November.
Tramp's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the elections in the United States is a confirmation of the fact that officials of the United States informed the Reuters agency: a new stage in the Washington's increasing pressure campaign is coming.
While foreign Governments are the rule to place commercial advertisements for trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a position to escalate trade war, which is the result of which they equipped tariffs to import their countries.
China's responsible tariffs at the beginning of the trade war had the task of impressing exporters in States like Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Tramp, stated Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador in China, and former long-term governor of Iowa, the large exporter of agricultural products to China, claims that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and business.
China, according to Branstad in the article published in the Sunday Journal of Des Moines Register, “consequently doubles this trauma by placing propaganda advertising in our own free press”.
“In disseminating its propaganda, the Government of China is using our dear American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying and placing advertising in Des Moines Register,” says Branstad.
“As in the newspaper kiosks here, in the streets of Beijing, you will hardly hear different votes and you will not see the real diversity of views that the Chinese could learn when they learned about the anxious economic policy of China, since the local media are under strict control of the communist party of China,” he wrote.
He also added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers had “crossed familiarly” from the proposal to publish its article, although it did not give a precise name of the publication.
Analysts warn: Cavano disposal by the Republicans disturb the elector women before the interim period
Many high-level republicans prefer to stay aside and protect the candidacy of Supreme Judge Brett Cavano despite several statements of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative response, especially by women, which may affect the forthcoming interim elections.
The emotions around this situation have ripped up to extreme, and most Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be returned later, ” says Grant Rier, a professor of politology at Maxwell's University of Syracuse, in his article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that the attempts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI in the last minute would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, and they will not forget it tomorrow or November”, said Karin Jean-Pierre, the senior advisor and the National Representative of the MoveOn Progressive Group to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestants scanded “November ahead!” against the Senate, when the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to invoke Cavano candidature despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blacey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be out of the framework”, stated on the news site, non-party politician Stu Rotenberg.
“People say that the situation has already struck enough, and it is true.
But everything may become worse, especially in the plan of women's elections in the predecessions and young voters, from 18 to 29 years, which, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate to the Supreme Court of Justice, accusing him of sexual harassment, the analysts assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the movement, this step could cause a response.
“This is already a mess for the Republican Party”, said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of the last week, reports NBC News.
“It is not only about the vote in the committee or the final vote, or whether Cavano is sitting on the camp of the accused, but also how the Republicans deal with it,” said Guy Cesil, director of Priorities of the United States, a group that helps select democrats, the news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seemed to have divided some on the question of whom to trust — Ford or Cavano — and are a little more inclined to the last.
The new YouGov survey showed that 41 percent of the respondents were accurately or probably trusted in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said that they believed in Cavano exactly or probably.
Furthermore, 38 per cent believe that Cavano had probably lied during his testimony, while 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
At the insist of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations raised by the Ford and, at least, another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, the Ford swore to testify at the Senate Legal Committee that Cavano, in a state of drunkness, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the post of the Supreme Judge showed her genitalia at the party during the Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Patience Designer plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Spider, launched a startup that pretends to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and how people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview, the Fast Company Berners-Lee jokes that the purpose of the Inrupt is to gain “the world sovereignty”.
"We must do this now," he says about his startup.
“This is a historical moment.”
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own online data storages.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools for data work.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify -- everything can be used in the same browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data storage is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal enlargement of rights and opportunities through data”.
According to the Director-General of John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company has provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of staff developers with whom the project contract was concluded and the volunteer programmers community.
Since this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee said that he and his team did not negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether his companies should make cardinal changes, which made all their business models altogether.
“We do not ask for permission.”
In his post on the Medium published on Saturday, Berners Lee wrote that “the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusett Technology Institute.
In recent months, Berners Lee's voice sounded quite influenced in the net neutrality debate.
Even by launching the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortion, the Internet Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet," says Berners Lee.
Bernard Van: A churchman rewarded by Victoria's cross during World War I
In the history of the English Church, only one soldier was rewarded by Victoria's cross during World War I, and this event was observed in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Reverend Bernard Wann was rewarded by this prize on 29 September 1918 for taking part in the Bellenglis and Leukur attack.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military prize.
The monument of this event was solemnly presented by two grandchildren on the parade in Rushden, Northgamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Wann, said that it was “very symbolic” that the monument was opened just 100 years after his grandfather received the reward.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Colonel Wann conducted his battalion through the St. Canten channel “in a very thick fog and under a strong fire of field weapons and guns.”
Later, he threw himself on the line of fire and led the group forward with “the greatest courage” and then dropped the field gun with one hand, beating three soldiers.
Colonel Wann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old hero grandson, Michael Wann, said that “he would hardly have been able to do the same heroic, but it is reassuring.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Wann, also put a vein on the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood.
Michael Wann said that it was “a great honour to participate in the parade” and added that “the goodness of a true hero was confirmed by support that would be provided by many people”.
MMA worshipers didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead showed them Peppo's pig.
Imagine that you haven't slept all night to see the full Bellator 206, but you didn't see the main event.
The San José table contained 13 fights, including six fights of the main programme, broadcasting the fights throughout the night on the 5th TV channel of Great Britain.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for a meeting, the British fans were shocked by seeing the Peppa Pig.
Some cheerleaders weren't impressed, since they weren't sleeping until the morning just to watch the fights.
One of the Twitter fans called this change in the child's multifilm “some painful joke”.
“The State decision was made that this containment was inappropriate for 6 hours in the morning, so they had to switch to child programmes”, said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president Bellator on Marketing and Communications, when he was asked why this happened.
"Yes, Pig Peppa."
President of the company Bellator Scott Cocker said they planned to make a schedule in such a way that battles could also be seen in the future by the observers of Britain.
"When it comes to a new show, I think we can solve this issue," said Coker.
“But there is Sunday, six hours in the morning, and we cannot solve this question until Sunday at our time, and it will be Monday for them.
But we will make the maximum effort.
Trust me, when the broadcast was changed, a bunch of text messages had been wiped, and all of them had no friendly nature.
We tried to solve this problem immediately, thought it was a technical failure.
It turns out not, it was a matter of public importance.
I promise that next time that's not going to happen.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we're trying to increase this amount, but it's overcome.
Yes, it didn't work well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily had a feeling of inadequateness because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic Duber Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to be successful.
24-year-old athlete told him that he had not understood that “not everyone like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first program of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, which Lauren Lavern led, he said that he spoke about the gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that the victory at the Olympiade had become less concerned after his child had come up.
The Permanent Multiannual Show of Kirstie Young took a vacation for several months.
Dailey, speaking as the chief guest in the Lavern programme, said that he felt “wilder than any of his peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society both for boys and girls.
He says: "To this day, these feelings of inappropriateness and inappropriateness have been quite real, but they have given me strength, and I have been able to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was “this means” so that he would not disappoint everyone when they eventually learned of his sexual orientation.
The biennial bronze olympic medalist became a known LGBT activist and called on the country to decriminate homosexuality this year at the College Games in Australia.
He said that he expressed his view because he was lucky that he could live an open life without consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-fold world champion said that the feelings for a man, the American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, were “amazed”.
Last year, Dailey married Oscara, who was 20 years older than him, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
“If so much happens in your life in your young age, ” he went to his first Olympiada at 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer three years later, it is hard to find a peer who would have the same cardially contrary life experience.
The couple became parents in June, and they had a son called Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said that “all of his world-wideness” had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win a gold medal," says the sportsman.
"But you know, there are things more important than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named by his father Robert, who died in 2011, when he was 40 years old from brain cancer.
Dailey said that his father did not want to deal with his death, and one of his last requests was tickets to the first row of London 2012.
"I couldn't say to him, "Papa, you will not be around, and you will not be able to sit there in the first row," says Dali.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing, I finally realized that he was not invincible," the sportsman said.
Next year, Daily participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I dreamed of all my life -- to dive before the crowds of the Olympic Games, there was no better sense," he said.
This also inspired him to choose the first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small — that helped him prepare for the Olympiade and still liked him so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 in English summer time.
Michelson, who is not in the form, took this Saturday Rider Cube on the camp.
The American Phil Michelson will set up a record on Sunday by playing his 47th game of Rider's Cube, but he's gonna have to pull up his shape to avoid an unpleasant hatch.
Michelson, who played the biennale on the 12th record, was sent by Captain Jim Furick on a camp on Saturday for four balls and four balls.
Instead of being in the centre of events, as often happened in the United States, the five-fold major winner divided his day between monitoring the game and working on its own game on the field in hope to correct what is concerned.
Never without the directest strike, even on the top of his career, a 48-year-old athlete is not a perfect candidate for a hard route of Le Golf National, where the long raff usually punishes inaccurate attacks.
And if the course itself is not enough frightening, Michelson will meet the exact British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12s alone matches make a big start, Michelson's match might be decisive.
Ferrick expressed confidence in his partner, though what else he could say.
“He fully understood the role that he played on me today, grabbed me in his back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” commented Ferrick.
"He is quite confident in himself.
He is a walking Hall of glory, and he has done so much for these commands in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two matches.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's how we decided to go.
He wants to be there, together with all."
On Sunday, Michelson will beat Nick Faldo's record on the number of matches in the Rider Cube.
This could mark the end of the career in the Rider Cube, which never corresponded to the heights of its individual record.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven people, although Ferrick said that his presence had great benefits to the team.
“He is a fun, sarcastic, discreet, he likes to name people, and he is a great guy with whom it is interesting,” he explained.
“I think young players had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see it.
His game is much more than just a game."
Captain of the European Team Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, has experienced that significant leadership at a single level in the Rider Cube can easily turn into a disadvantaged side.
The Dutch debuted in the 1997 match in Walderraam, where the Northern Ballesteros team had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but only overcome the final line a little ahead with the least difference by wining the account of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderraam where we won, but only so far," said Bjorn, sealed on the photograph, after watching the Class of 2018, winning at the Le Golf National field on both Friday and yesterday, which resulted in the 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll be full.
Go and do it right.
Until the glasses are set on the table, nothing is over.
We have a goal, which is the chance to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I said not silent, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we do well know that we are against the greatest players of the world."
The satisfiedness of his players in the uncomfortable golf field for them, Bjorn added: “I would never have overcome myself in this.
We're going to have another test tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual speeches start, and this is a different matter.
It's always nice to be with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone, you're testing all your skilled golf players.
That's what the players need to think about tomorrow.
Now the partner remains behind, and he must also make all his efforts."
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferrick, believes that his players individually will act better than partners, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who set three points from four.
The Ferrick himself went through all this carousel of the last days, being part of the victory team in Brooklyn before finally lose when Europe spent the Wonder in Medina.
"I remember every damn word about it," he answered in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain, in 1999, joined his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to finish this as in Brooklyn as in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it is high pressure on the game in the middle.
We have built our game plan accordingly, and set up the children as we believed to be right, you know? tomorrow we will try to create a miracle."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the resistance by meeting Rory Macilroy at the top machete with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Iyan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
"I have chosen this group of boys, and in this order, because I believe that they will cover all possible deficiencies," Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
Introduction of a new military ship of Germany has been renewed
The new German fleet fregat was to be introduced in 2014 to replace the older warships of the cold war age, but this would not occur at least next year because of the incorrect systems and lavino-like cost growth, reports local media.
Introduction to the operation of Reinland-Pfaltz, the main ship, is now deferred to the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, with reference to a military representative.
The ship was to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that occurred after delivery had complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
Four ships of Baden-Vurtemberg class, ordered by the Marine Float in 2007, will be replaced by the older Bremen class fregates.
It is known that they will have a powerful rifle, a number of zienic and anti-propelled missiles, as well as some of the Stels technology, such as reduced radiolocation, infrared and acustical signs.
Other important features include longer service periods — the possibility of deploying the latest fregates for up to two years away from home ports.
Nevertheless, the continuous delay in the operation meant that the most modern military ships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power outside, are already getting old until they enter arms, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 unfortunate fregat had been in the news headlines last year when the German Navy officially rejected the entry into operation of the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss portfolio in Hamburg.
This was the first case when the fleet returned the ship to the ship after the ship was delivered.
Not much was known about the reasons for return, but German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware defects” that made the military ship useless.
Software shortages were particularly critical because the Baden-Vurtemberg courts would be exploited by a crew of approximately 120 seamen, only half of the workforce on the old fregates of the Bremen class.
Furthermore, the ship was too heavy, reduced its productivity and limited the ability of the IMF to implement updates in the future.
It is estimated that the 7000-tonne Reinland-Pfaltz is twice the heavyer ships of the same class that were used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the incorrect equipment, the cost of the project, including the training of the team, is also a problem.
It was said that it had achieved the turbulent EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of retention at the core of the new fregates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings on the reduction of Germany's military and maritime power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Protection Committee, recognized that the maritime forces are actually “continuing the stock of ships capable of deployment”.
The official said that the problem had elaborated with time because the old ships were expelled from operation, but they had not been provided to replace them.
He visited that none of the Baden-Vurtemberg class fregates could ever be taken to the fleet.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of flying mouses
A new study carried out in one of the sites of the Scotland Mount has a goal to show how flat mouses use landscapes in search of food.
It should be hoped that the data received will reconsider the behavior of unique winged peasants and help to maintain the species.
The study organized by the Scientists of the National Fund of Scotland will be studied by ordinary netopyres, soprano netopyres, as well as brown long-headed sticking mouses and nights of Dobanton, inhabitants of Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special registrators will be established in some areas around the place to monitor the action of flagging mouses throughout the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys of the area using manual detectors.
The expert audio analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screaming, as well as the activities for which various groups of these animals are responsible.
The map of the environment will then be drawn up and a report will be prepared to create a detailed picture of their behaviour in the scale of landscape.
Rob Duar, a NTS Nature Adviser, hopes that these results will show which places of residence are most important for flagging mouses and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main directions of the management of the environment, such as the formation of lungs, as well as the ways to maintain forest massages, optimum for flying mouses and other related species.
Flying mouse populations in Scotland and all over Britain have been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are under threat of disappearance because of construction and girlship work that affects their residence and the loss of the environment.
Wind turbines and lighting plants may be dangerous, as well as a flies stick, chemical processing of construction materials and hunting home cats.
In fact, the sticky mouses are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching.
They use a complex echo-location technique to define the obstacles in the way of flight.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very seriously perceived to the population of flying mouses.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, travel checks and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even created the first and only reservation of flying mouses in the Area of Threave in Damfris and Hallowee, where eight of the ten types of Scottish flying mouses live.
The estate manager David Thompson said that the property was a perfect territory for them.
“This, in Threave, is an excellent place for sticky mouses,” he said.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of the good environment.
But a lot of flying mouses remains unknown, so the work we do here and in other places will help us better understand what they need to be well-being."
It recalls the importance of verifying the availability of flying mouses before carrying out technical services within private possessions, since unintended destruction of one nest can lead to death to 400 females and young people, and perhaps even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mouses are protected by law, their destruction, nutrition or destruction of their residence is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish Foundation Officer for the Conservation of Flying Mice, calls upon the public to help.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our flying mouses, and we just don't know how many individual species live in them.”
Ronald denies the charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to court the German journal
Cristian Ronald denied the charges against him for rape, calling them "fake news", and claiming that people are just "willing to be embarrassed" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spiegel, which issued accusations against the footballist.
Forward of Portugal and Yuventus was accused of rape by a American woman named Catherine Mayorga, which appeared to have been held in the hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $355,000 to talk about the incident, said Spiegel on Friday.
In the Instagram video, in which a football player had 142 million subscribers, a few hours after the charges report, the 33-year-old Ronald called this information “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they told today is all the vile news," says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on the camera.
“ They just want to spin through my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous, speaking my name, but it's just part of their work.
I am a happy person, and I'm fine,” adds a smile sportsman.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue the Spiegel for the accusations they called “inadmissible information on confidentiality suspicions”, according to Reuters.
The attorney Christian Sherc stated that the player intends to require compensation for “moral damage to the severity of legal violations, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
It is confirmed that the alleged incident occurred in the hotel Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
Meeting at the night club, Ronald and Mayorga seemed to have returned to the player's room, where he was allegedly raped in analytical form, according to the documents submitted in the District Court of Clarke in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronald fell on her knees and told her that he was a “99 per cent good guy, but he was one per cent worse.”
The documents claimed that Ronald confirmed that the couple had sex, but that was in mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she had turned to the police and the hospital had taken pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement, because she felt “the fear of revenge” and was afraid of “public degradation”.
A 34-year-old woman said that she was trying to change the place of residence, since she continued to experience traumatic feelings caused by the incident.
Ronald was going to join the Real Madrid from Manchester United during the supposed attack, but this summer he went to the Italian giant Yuve deal for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain “regrets the autoproducers lost forever”
The Minister for Business and Entrepreneurship Greg Clark stated that Britain would "regret it forever" if after Brexit lost its status of the world leader in the field of car production.
He also commented on the fact that Toyota UK reported BBC that, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese autoproducer stated that the implications of delays at the border if the Brexit deal is not available may result in loss of jobs.
Toyota Auris and Avensis produced in Bernastone, and last year it released nearly 150,000 cars, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernastone.
Other car manufacturers in Great Britain expressed concerns about the exit of the EU without an international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW states that the Mini production factory in Oxford will be closed within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to the autoproducers, if the Brexit supply chain is not available will be highly risked.
The Toyota manufacturing line is launched " exactly in time " and the details for vehicles made for order are provided by British and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If Britain leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there may be disturbances on the border that, according to the representatives of the industry, may lead to delays and lack of particles.
According to the company, Toyota would not be able to store stocks in its factory in Derbishire for more than one day, so the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan in Checkers on future relations with the EU was “calibrated in order to avoid those checks on the border”.
“We need a deal. We want to conclude a better agreement that will allow, repeat, not only to achieve success at present but also to use this opportunity in the future,” he said in the broadcast of BBC Radio 4 programme “Day”.
“Not only Toyota but also other producers claim that we should be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to clarify the time for which production would be stopped, but in a longer term, she warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, eventually, would reduce jobs.
Peter Zuvallaris, who has worked in Bernastone for 24 years and is the head of the trade union, says that the concern of members of the organization is growing: “It is my experience that if we lose these jobs, we can't recover them.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU.”
Tramp meeting with Rosenstein may be re-revoked, on the information of the White House
The responsible meeting of Donald Tramp with the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be " transferred for another week", as the fight for the candidature of Brett Cavano for the Supreme Court of Justice continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is courier of the work of a special advisor Robert Muller, investigating Russia ' s intervention in elections, links between Tramp and Russia and potential obstacles to justice by the President.
If Tramp exempted the Deputy General Prosecutor from his position, thus threatening Muller's independence, many speculations had been caused in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of a lift to record talks with Tramp and the possibility of the president's impeachment by 25th amendment.
Rosenstein objects to this information.
However, on last Monday, he seemed to have gone to the White House to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Tramp was announced on Thursday, which was then at the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said that he would "no" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Court Committee on which Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blacey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Tramp ordered a weekly investigation of the FBI complaints in Cavano, which further delayed the full vote in the Senate.
Press Secretary Tramp, Sarah Sanders, spoke at Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been appointed, possibly this week, but it may be delayed for another week, taking into account all other events in the Supreme Court.”
But we will see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed."
Some journalists contested this claim: Sanders had not briefed in the White House since 10 September.
The leading Chris Wallace wondered why.
Sanders said that the absence of briefings has not been caused by “contempt to the community” of television journalists, although she added: “I will not deny that they are playing public.”
It proposed to increase the number of direct contacts between Tramp and the press.
“The President holds more meetings, answering journalists than any other president before it,” she added, not bringing exact numbers, however, “We have these numbers.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would continue to take place, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.”
We are trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we have spent in the last few weeks, and if you can directly talk to the President of the United States, this is a decent replacement for press briefings."
Tramp regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, participating in open meetings or press conferences with high-level persons.
The press conference is generally rare.
The frevolous and sometimes strange behaviour of the President to gathered journalists this week in New York may be the answer why.
The Minister of Health addresses the workers of the EU in Scotland with a letter on the concerns of Brexit
The Minister of Health called on EU staff working in the Scotland GHZ to express his appreciation from the name of the entire country and wish them to remain on their posts after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, SME, addressed this letter to staff less than six months before the exit of Britain from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the value of the application of status for EU citizens working in their public services.
In her letter, Ms. Friman wrote: “In the course of the summer, the negotiations between Britain and the EU have continued on the issue of exit, and this fall must be the expected decision.
However, the Government of the Great Britain also strengthens the preparation for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know this must be a very anxious time for all of you.
Therefore, right now, I would like to emphasize again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all the EU and beyond it have a valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health services and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombi carried an emergency operation on head trauma
Michael The Tennessee Authority reported that the Tennessee State Tigers Semi-Protector Christian Abercromby carried out an emergency operation, receiving a head trauma on Saturday after the defeat of 31 to 27 at the Vanderbilt Commodores match.
The Chief Coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told journalists that the injury had been received shortly before the break.
“ He went to the sideline and just fell down there, ” said Reid.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombi oxygen on a sideline before putting it on their noses and taking a medical survey.
The official of the Tennessee state told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombi was operational in Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that “not yet details of type/degree of injury”, and in Tennessee, they were trying to find out when the injury occurred.
For Abercromby, only a second course, it was the first season of Tennessee State after the relocation of Illinois.
On Saturday, before he left the game, he successfully captured five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher gerb collection when buying real estate in Great Britain.
In accordance with the new Tori plans, foreign buyers will be collected from higher herbs when buying real estate in Great Britain, and additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This step will lead to no results of Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
Increased herb collection will be collected from those who do not pay the tax in Britain
The penalty expects it to gather up to 120 million pounds per year for homeless
Foreign buyers will be collected from a higher herb collection when buying real estate in Great Britain, and additional funds will be used to help homeless people — Teresa May will announce today.
This step would result in the Corbin's attempts to attract young voters, who promised to make the housing more accessible and to increase citizens' income.
The increase in herb collection will be taken from physical persons and firms not paying tax in Great Britain, and the additional funds provided should stimulate Government ' s efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The supplementary to the existing herb collection, including the improvement introduced two years ago to acquire acquisition of secondary housing and housing for rental, may be up to three per cent.
The penalty expects that this step will deliver up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new London real estate are purchased by non-Britan inhabitants, leading to price growth and complicating the challenge of buyers acquiring their first housing to improve their housing conditions.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of a large number of foreign buyers who have purchased accommodation here spend most of their time outside the country.
A new policy was developed a few weeks later, after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the harbor gathering in order to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused major construction companies of estate prices by acquiring land, but in fact not using them, and called on Ms. Mae to give up quotas for the available housing to correct the “happy situation with housing” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rental control and cease unfounded expulsion.
He also wished to give local authorities more authority to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “In last year, I said that I dedicated my prime ministership to the fulfillment of the British dream to make life better with every new generation.
This, inter alia, means a solution to problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open for people who want to live, work and build life here.
Nevertheless, it is unfair for non-UK citizens and foreign companies to acquire real estate as is available to British employees.
For too many, the dream of acquiring their own home has become too far away, and the threat to some to be on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: “My final goal is to manage Scotland”
The chief of the Sunderland Club, Jack Ross, said that his “final goal” was to become a Scotland manager at a certain stage.
A 42-year-old Scotch enjoys the reinstatement of the North-East Club, which is currently third in the first league, which separates three points from the first.
In this summer, he went to the Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren to the Prime Minister of Scotland in the past season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a hat B and all," said Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up when I was a child, watching my father behind Scotland in Hampden, and that always attracted me back.
However, such an opportunity will only occur if I can be a successful club manager."
Foreigners of Ross were also directors of the Sunderland, Dick Lawyers, David Moyes, Sam Allardyes, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Poet and Paulo De Kanio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic said that he had not experienced trembling before such authorized names in such large clubs, renouncing Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals earlier.
"For me, success will now depend on whether I can bring this club back to the Prime Minister's League.
According to its structure and opportunities, this club is undoubtedly belonging to the Prime Minister of League," said coach.
"Leaving him there is a difficult task, but I will believe that I have done my job only if I can bring the club back."
Ross only worked for the manager for three years, first associate in Dumbarton, then spent 15 months in the Hearts Coach.
He then helped Alloa to rise from the third level, and in the next season, St. Mirren took out the lower positions to the champion winner.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable today than ever during his game career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It must have been a real crossroad”, he recalls his responsibilities at Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that management was more suitable than a game.
That sounds strange because I've done everything well, I've made a good job, and I've made some success.
But the game is more difficult.
There are many things to be done every week.
I still feel stressed at work, but I feel good at the governor's positions.
I've always wanted to lead, and now, doing this, I feel as comfortable as a fish in the water throughout my adult life."

The summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but reduced sales in restaurants networks.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7 per cent, and the restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the CGA business consulting company, who received this statistics, explains: “The long-term solar activity and more than expected, the participation of England in the world championship means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, and in restaurants, on the contrary, significantly reduced.”
The June income drop in the restaurant trade of 1.8 per cent has also continued in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinking showed much higher results in restaurants.
The pubs that only sell food also suffered from the sun’s heat, although not as much as the restaurants.
There's a feeling that people want to jump out just to miss a glass.
The sales of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month, and food by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, a RSM analyst in the area of duration and hotel business, said: “These results continue the trend we see from the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports activities remain critical when dealing with sales in the non-profit market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, even more that sales by 4.8 per cent in the annual calculation will be particularly painful because of the continuing price pressure.
The long hot summer has been unlikely for food-working operators, and not the fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will give so much rest.”
The overall growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including reopened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of brands.
Industrial sales monitoring of Coffer Peach Tracker on the British Pab, Bars and Restaurants collects and analyses data on productivity of 47 networks with a total of more than 9 billion pounds of sterlings and is a recognised sectoral tallion.
Every fifth child has secret accounts in social networks that he hides from his parents.
According to the survey, each fifth child — some of them only 11 years old — has secret accounts in social networks that he hides from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the growth of the pages of the Fake Insta
This news has increased the fear of sexual nature
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic" account that parents know.
However, each fifth child — some of them only 11 years old — makes accounts in social networks that he hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in high schools revealed a rapid increase in the number of "insty" fee accounts, i.e. Instagram, photo exchange website.
This news has increased the fear of the publications of sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of the students claimed that they had a main, " clean" account that had access to their parents, but also had secret accounts.
One mother, who had accidentally accessed a secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, met there a teenager who called on others to “forsake him”.
Study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles in social networks, and half of them admitted that one of them was generally secret.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanen says: “Mnogy teenagers seek to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and this is an alarming fact.”
Alyde Doyle will be the "sportsman" voice of the Scottish Light Athletic
At the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body, Alyd Doyle was elected to the Council of Directors of Scotland's Light Athletic as a observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most eager sportsman of Scotland, and President Yan Bitty claims that this is an excellent opportunity for those who run sports, to use the extensive experience of the international sportsman during the last decade.
"Aylid has great respect in the Scotland, British and World Light Atlantic Community, and we are sure that its participation will bring a light athletic in Scotland great benefit," said Bitti.
Doyle says: “I seek to be the voice of sportsmen, and I hope that I can really contribute to the development of sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has four gold Olympic medals, and now works as a serial commentator on the BBC, and has lost his ability to walk after a transferred stroke.
He writes in his Twitter: “I had an stroke a month ago.
I lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time will show if I am well, and if so, to what extent.
It was an exhausting work, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again, and today I have exercised incredible practices!
Thank you very much for your support!"
The advertising of a milk sugar that compared mothers with cows shared the views of Internet users
The milk-sooth company has caused disputes on the Internet by publishing a advertising in which feeding mothers are compared to breeding cows.
Publishing the market, it is said, “the first silent milk sauce in the world that can be carried on the breasts,” the Elvie producer of consumer technology published a advertising music video demonstrating the freedom that a new milk sausage provides to mothers feeding.
Four real mothers dance in a full sea bench under a musical track, which says: "Yes, I feed my own milk, but you can't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a wash, it's my breast."
And then the choir: "We pursue, we persecute, we feed our babies with breast milk, we pursue, we persecute."
This advertising film, published on the Facebook website, caused disputes on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video has received a distinct response from the viewers, and many say it is lighting on the " horrors" of the breast industry.
“It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to produce milk, except for their children to be taken from them for a few days after their birth," says one user.
Elvie Molocoots is dressed directly under a special busthalter (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is clearly the same trauma for both mothers and children.
But yes, why don't you use them to advertise the milk sausage for the mothers who keep their children? "
Another user adds: “The advertisement is distracted from reality”.
Others were protecting the film, and one woman even wrote that the song was “great. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was feeding the baby, I would have bought one.
Feeding my breasts really made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but that's how it feels.
A genuine product,” wrote one user.
And another comment: "A fabulous advertisement based on mothers who feed their breasts (often they do it directly in their workplaces or in the toilets) and which, indeed, they feel a little "cows."
This advertisement is not to praise or disregard our breast industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they were all dancing with these unseen milk sucks hidden under the busthalters.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breastfeeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk sauce is absolutely insensitive, has no gums or pipes, is freely placed in a feeding bullet, and is not noticed by the possibility of women to move, hold children and even go outside during feeding.
Anne Balarin, a partner and an early child development expert of Mother, comments: “Molocoots Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserves courageous and provocative ads.
By conducting a parallel between women and cows, we wanted to focus on breast-feeding and all its problems, demonstrating a jolly and joyful way of showing the incredible sense of freedom that gives a new milk sausage.
This is not the first time Elvie's milk supplies get into the headlines of the news.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage of Marta Jacobian designer using this product for appointment.
Thousands of migrant children moved without obstacles to the Chamber camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrants detained has increased rapidly, although the number of monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, partly because the hard rhetoric and policy imposed by the Tramp administration have difficultyed the placement of children with the supervisors.
The majority of sponsors are usually the same immigrants with no documents and are afraid to threaten their stay in the country by taking the child's assignment.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential commissioners and other adult members of their families would provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-level Immigration and Customs Officer, testified in the Congress that the Agency arrested dozens of people who requested to take care of the minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested were not judged earlier.
“Over 80 per cent of those who are either commissioners or members of their families are illegally in the country, and a major part of them are foreigners who have committed crime.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these persons," said Olbens.
With the words of the shelter workers, in order to accelerate the process of the establishment of children, the officials introduced new rules, according to which some of them should be brought before the court within a month of imprisonment, not within 60 days, as was previously.
In order to declare their legal status by the Immigration Judge, many of them are present on video contacts, not personally.
Those who are deemed to have no right to help will be deported quickly.
According to shelter and information workers who have been in the system in recent months as long as children remain in prison, the more likely they are concerned or depressed, which may lead to violence or escape attempts.
Advocates say that these problems are enhancing in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where the signs of the child's difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the agency.
They add that transporting children into chamber camps without giving them time emotionally to prepare or say goodbye to friends may make the injury that many of them have already been fighting.
Syria commands the United States, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw troops
While speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Mualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the hostilities of war in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were in the Syrian country illegally, under the motivation of counter-terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly”.
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions," he said to the gathering.
Mualem insists that more than 360 000 people have died in Syria since 2011 and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war against terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue to “go this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “every illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has placed about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and consult both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs speaking against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent counts more than 1,000 soldiers in the country covered by war.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions were established for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of“proliferation of irrational fears” that encouraged refugees to stay outside the country.
“We called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote the return of citizens,” he said.
“They politicize what must be a pure humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be renewed until the political agreement on the cessation of war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the latest major salary of Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement prevented the widespread attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province of three million people.
However, Mualem emphasized that the agreement had " clear deadlines " and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the dżihadists, including against the fighters from the Al-Qaida Front of Nusra, who would "be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee will be convened soon, consisting of representatives of Government and opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and put the way to elections.
Muallem stated the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the work of the Commission should be limited to “examining articles of the current Constitution” and warned against intervention.
Why Tramp wins the second time?
Following this logic, Mr. Tramp will win the re-election in 2020, if the impeachment and scandal do not conclude his presidency in advance, which is probably the hope of many Liberal observers.
And it will certainly be the “the most dramatic final of the presidentship in history!”
At present, there are no signs of the exhaustion of the viewers.
Since 2014, Prime Time ratings have increased more than twice to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nelsen, the Fox News averaged 2.4 million Prime-Time viewers, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has exceeded the cable channel ratings, collecting 3,5 million per night at the show of main news.
“This is the fire to which people are drawn, because it is beyond our understanding,” said Neal Barr, director of the ABC Drama “Appointed survivor”, on a member of the ministerial office, who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Scowell, a long-term comedian writer and writer of the "So funny: several unpleasant truths about the invasion of Hollywood boys" suggest another theory.
She recalls once her ride on a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Tramp.
“ Why? ” she asked.
He said, "Yes, because he's ridiculous!", said Mrs. Scowell.
There is something valuable in all this chaos — it is joy.
Of course, since, unlike all the other content translated on television, the historical lines on the developments of Washington can define the future by Row against Wade and answer the possibility of reunifying the families of immigrants and the health of the world economy.
Exception is a luxury that only the most privileged observers can afford.
However, when you are already six o'clock in order to see how a team of experts discusses the use of Bob Woodward ' s "deep background" for his book "Strah" or about Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 from the struckle's skin (the dress heated with pride," says Washington Post), or about a sharp description of Story Daniels, say, Mr. Tramp's anatomy, it is already out of the normal awareness.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario again with the same eyes.
"His work is partly to make us feel that the reality show is that he feeds you with something every night," says Brent Montgomery, executive director Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the "Pawn Stars" on the changing acting part of the Tramp show and the daily turns of the story (the dragon with N.F.L., the commendation of Kim Chen Wina).
You can't afford to miss any episode or you're in hopeless.
When I contacted Mr. Flace this week, there was 27 degrees of heat on the north coast of Kauai, the sun shined, but he was hiding inside his home and watching MSNBC during CNN recording.
He was unable to evade from the screen, at least not when it was shown how Brett Cavano was presented to the Senate Legal Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was decided.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Flace.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Outside funds are influencing into the most violent intermediate elections led by the White House
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania district receives cash flows by changing the districts in the Congress, where two officials participate in the race for the same place.
This suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed so recently, supports a democrat, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Connor Lamb, who was held in another district at extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb speaks against another active official, the Republican of Kit Rothfus, who presents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is substantially crossing with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that, as a result of pre-electoral machinations, the old areas were assigned to the Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district raised a warm discussion on the financing of campaigns between the main party ' s financial forces, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican campaign (NRCC).
The name Lamba became known in Pennsylvania after a small difference in the special elections observed in March in Congress in the 18th Pennsylvania district.
This place has been taken by the Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Tramp won the county with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give democrats a small advantage.
United States punished El Salvador for the support of China, but then resigned
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which caused a negative response from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Tramp held a warm meeting with President of Panama, Juan Karlos Varella, also owned Panama until the partners dismissed the Tramp Management Team.
The representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw American diplomatic mission leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “new decisions on the recognition of Taiwan”, said the press secretary of the Department of Heather Nauerth at the beginning of this month.
However, the punishment was considered only for El Salvador, who received about $140 million of US aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions, would be painful for this country of Central America with its high unemployment and murder.
In the framework of the regular internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was followed in the outcome of the similar meeting that was held last year as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration in the United States.
However, by mid-September, the high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted the preparation of the conference to progress, and actually ceased the question of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference was scheduled in mid-October, and it would be held by Vice-President Mike Pens in the significance that the administration attached the real importance to the meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and I did not bring from Washington any new rigid communications or sanctions.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the debate details of three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic issues under anonymity.
Their records were also confirmed by a foreign analyst in the course of the administration, but also spoke to anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the communication of a special advisor Robert Muller on the possible obstacle to Mr. Trump of justice, which is now very significant in public reports.
Mr. Mueller, reportedly, also investigated the facts that the Tramp's campaign and its attacks were in the past elections.
If the Congress has changed the master, Mr. Tramp will face responsibility in that body, just as he is preparing to speak again to the voters and may eventually to the jury members of his colleagues.
But there are many "if"; I do not mean that the fall of Mr. Tramp is inevitable, as well as the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We'll all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the length of the fight.
In 1938, the German officers were willing to set up a state revolution and drop Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czech Slovak troops in München.
However, we did not, and we missed the possibility of avoiding the coming years of bloodshed.
The course of history is deployed at such points, and the unpleasant democracy march is accelerating or delaying.
The Americans have experienced some of these fractures now.
What would we do if Mr. Tramp fired the Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, he proposed to make secret records of the president's activities last year and to consider his inappropriate position.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times data are not valid.
"How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation on Brett Cavano is not complete or true, or if it is still approved by the Supreme Judge, despite the trusted accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
First of all, will we vote in the medium-term prospect for the Congress that will bring Mr. Trump to responsibility?
If we do not pass these tests decently, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe we can go through them with the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jew, sent to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime, whose officials used to take care of the Ambassador home in which I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later carried me to burn saturday candles on the swastique table.

Graham Dorrance, from Rangers, is optimistically set up in the predecession of a football club vienna Rapid.
Rangers accept the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory of the Austrians, after the impressive in Spain over the Villiareal at the beginning of this month, will allow them to take strong positions in the G League of Europe.
The knee trauma interfered with Graham Dorrance's season for the first time to speak with the account of 2:2 against Villiareal, but he believes that the Rangers could use the result as a tramplin to achieve great results.
"This was a good moment for us, because "Williarreal" is a good team," said 31-year-old footballist.
"We went into a game, assuming we could get something and left with no one.
Perhaps at the end, we could have done it, but in general, no one could have been a fair result.
They may have played better in the first time, and our success has come to the second time where we have been better.
This Thursday will be another large European night.
I hope we can get three points, but this will be a complicated game because they showed good results in their last game, but given the support of the cheerleader, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year, it was definitely difficult, taking into account all my traumas and substitutes in the club itself, but there is a good factor right now.
The composition is well improved, and the boys are really enjoying it; the training went to "hoo".
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the past season and achieve success."
Women lose their sleep because of fear of their pension accumulation
Although the survey had a clear concept of how they wanted to take care of them, few have spoken to their family.
About half of the people participating in the national study said they discussed the value of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10 per cent said that they were talking to their children.
“People wish to care for them, but they do not try to discuss this subject,” said Holly Snyder, Vice-President Nationwide for Life Insurance.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your husband and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t give up your wishes.
Discuss with your consultant and family, where and how you will receive medical assistance, as this choice may be an important factor in the cost.
Consult your financial consultant: he will help you develop a plan for the payment of those expenditures.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may be covered by a traditional insurance policy of long-term care or a mixed life insurance policy that will help to cover these expenditure or self-insurance by means of your own property provided that you have money.
Take your legal documents in order: relieve yourself from legal batteries.
Make sure that your health care is confidential and appoint a trusted person to control your health care and ensure that professionals fulfil your wishes if you can't communicate.
We also recommend that the possibility of financial reliability be considered.
A trusted person should be selected to help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your accounts if you are unavailable.
Do not forget the smallest things: Imagine that your older parent needed immediate medical assistance, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Can you provide information about what drugs he takes and what he's allergic to?
Write all these details on the paper to prepare for any case.
Martin adds: “It is important not only to have funds but also to choose doctors.”
"What kind of medication are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Construct and write this plan."
In Ilfracomba, a man fired a few times from a pneumatic gun.

The victim, in the breast, the stomach and the hand of the bullets, was 40 years old in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracomba, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which took place at about 2:30 in the English summer time as a " random".
The victim hasn't seen the attacker.
The wounds are not dangerous for life, the police are currently searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami crashed in the Indonesia city of Palo on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
Because of the exit of the communications, rescueers cannot get any information from Donghal, a region north of Palo, which is closer to the earthquake centre by 7.5 points.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palo as a result of natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palo and Donghal on the Sulavezi Island:
Palo is the capital of the Central Sulavesa province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulavesa, with the estimated population of 379 800 (sub- 2017 data).
The city celebrated its 40th year when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donghala is a district extending 300 km (180 km) of the coast line in the northwest of Sulavesa.
The district, the administrative area of the smaller province, was 2,99,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the province's economy, Central Sulavesa, and in particular the coastal region of Donghal.
The nucleus is also important to the provincial economy, but mainly focused on Morvali, the opposite coast of Sulavesa.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of Natural Disasters, tsunami has been destroyed several times in Palo and Donghal over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people killed tsunami and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongal.
Tsunami also happened in the West of Donghal in 1996, resulting in nine deaths.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcanic fire ring and suffers from earthquakes regularly.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake in the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra, 26 December, caused tsunamis in 14 countries, which resulted in the death of 226,000 people along the Indian ocean coast, more than half of them in Achea.
2005: The sequence of strong earthquakes has fallen on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, at the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake by the force of 6.8 has struck the Southern Java, the most inhabited island of Indonesia, causing tsunami crashing on the southern coast, resulting in some 700 deaths.
2009: Magnetic earthquake occurred in Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra Province.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of 7.5 points took place on one of the Mentavian islands in Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The weak earthquake occurred in the Pidi Jay district in Acheha, causing destruction and panic, since people remembered the 2004 destructive earthquake and tsunami.
This time, tsunami didn't happen, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes have crashed on the tourist island of Lomboc, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily under ruins.
Sarah Paylin's senior son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Paylin, the senior son of the former Governor of Alaska and Vice Candidate at the President of Sarah Paylin, was arrested in charge of the assault.
The 29-year-old Paylin from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with domestic violence, and for resisting arrest, according to the statement published on Saturday by the Alaska police.
According to the police report, when one of his friends tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took the phone from her.
According to KTUU, Paylin is in an investigation isolator Mat-Su and will be bailed at $500.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, and when he was asked whether he was guilty, he declared his "a single innocence".
Peylin is threatened by three small crimes of class A, which means that he may be deprived of a period of up to one year and punished by $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a crime of class B, punished by deprivation of liberty for up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that the criminal charges against Paylin were raised.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently being reviewed by the Alaska Veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, the fake report of domestic violence and the storage of weapons in the state of alcoholic alcohol involving the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by the veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son's cruel behavior by a post-traumatic stress disorder that appeared to have been obtained as a result of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of killed
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake on the Indonesia Sulaveza Island on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 points caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications are not working, and in the coming days the number of victims will rise.
The earthquake took place near the central Sulaveza, which is north-east of the capital of Indonesia of Jacarda.
Social networks have accidental videos.
There were hundreds of people at the beach festival in Palu, when tsunami crashed on the shore.
The Federal Prosecutor wants to bring a rare death sentence to the suspect in New York.
The Federal Prosecutor in New York seeks a death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, suspected of the terror in New York, resulting in eight deaths, a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
In October 30 years, Saipov seemed to have rented a home Depot truck to attack a bikeway on the West Side road in the Lower Manhattan, waving on foot and bicycles.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” caused serious body damage, in accordance with the notification of the intention of a death penalty in the Southern County of New York.
According to the judicial document, both of these accusations may be sentenced to death.
Several weeks after the attack, the large federal jury read to Sayip a 22-point sentence, which included eight charges for the murder of a rocket used by the federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as the accusation of the use of violence and the destruction of cars.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “depthly planned and intentionally”, Sayipp proved it as described as“reluctant, cruel and criminal”.
“Saipullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused trauma, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nikolas Cleves, Anne Lora Decadta, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlius, Ernan Ferruci, Ernan Diego Mendosa and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko,” says the intentional notification.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the prosecutor demanded death penalty in the Southern County of New York for criminal offence.
In September 2009, the accused Halid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life.
The last time the death penalty on the federal case in New York was applied in 1953 in relation to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who was sentenced for a conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Rosenbergs were executed using the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the case documents of Saipov, the child of Uzbekistan demonstrated the lack of repentance after their perfect attack.
According to the police, he said to investigators that he was glad he did it.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the I.I.L. video on the phone to attack.
He also requested that the I.I.L. flag be hanged in his hospital chamber, the police reported.
He denied his guilt at all 22 prosecution points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders speaking on the side of Saipov, said that they were "approximately disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty rather than to life imprisonment without the possibility of exemption will only reduce the pain of these events for all their participants,” said Patton.
Saipov's protection had previously been addressed by prosecutors with no request for death penalty.
Member of the Parliament of Tori said that NAYGEL FARRAŽ should not be responsible for negotiations on Brexit
Today, during the protest at the Tori Nigel Faraz conference, he swore to “mobilize the People's Army”.
The former leader Ukip said that politics should feel nacals as one of the members of the Parliament of Teresa May assumed that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bown, member of the Conservatorial Party, said at the Birmingham meeting that Britain would have already been “surplus” if Mr. Faraz had been the Secretary of Brexit.
However, the problem facing Ms. Mae in attempting to reconcile its deeply divided lines is also aggravated by the fact that members of the Tory Party against the EU's exit are joining a separate protest against Brexit, which is being held in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to preserve its compromise plan in Checkers in the middle of attacks by the participants of Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the negative response, and thus force the European skeptics and layborists to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave (the Exit Meaning to survive) in Solihall, that he wants to "beat Checkers".
He proposed that Mr. Faraż be leveled and responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been responsible, we would have already gone,” he said.
The Deputy Wellingboro added: “I will continue to speak for Brexit, but we must win Checkers.”
When he spoke against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be addicted.
We want to establish our laws in our country."
Mr. Bone rejected the assumptions that the public view had changed after the vote in 2016: “The idea that the British had changed their views and wished to remain is completely incompatible.”
Brexit party from Tori Andrea Jenkins was also at the meeting, giving journalists the following comment: “I say, Prime Minister, just listen to people.”
"Checkers are unpopular among the public, opposition is not going to vote for this plan; it is also unpopular to members of our Party and our activists, who actually push the streets and choose us first.
Please put Checkers on the side and start listening to what they say to you."
In her sharp appeal to Ms. Mae, she added: “The Prime Ministers remain on their work if they remain faithful to their promises.”
Mr. Faraz said that if politics were going to give up the decision taken at the referendum of 2016, it was necessary to force them to feel nacal.
“It is now a matter of confidence between us, people and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, "We're not going to drop it out of your hands."
Turning to the excited crowd, he added: “I want our political class at the edge of the betrayal of Brexit to feel nacal.
"We mobilize the people's army of this country that has given us the victory of Brexit, and we will not calm down until we become independent, self-owned and proud of the United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the opponents of Brexit went with the Birmingham demonstration and then held a two-hour meeting in the centre of the city.
Several activists were waving the Tori versus Brexit on this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, the Leiborist Party, Lord Adonis, criticised the conservators for security problems in the mobile application of their party.
“And these people claim that they can set up the IT systems and technologies of Canada plus, for work on borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"This is one full farce.
Good Brexit does not exist in principle," he said.
Warren plans "to explore" the possibilities of participation in the presidential race
Member of the United States Parliament, Senator Elizabeth Warren, said that after November's elections, she would “explore the possibilities of balloting in the president”.
The Boston Globe reported that the democrat from Massachusetts told her future at the meeting of the Warden in the West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a part criticist of President Donald Tramp, has been balloted in November to reelect against a member of the Republican Party Jeff Dill, who was a co-Chairman of the Tramp campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There are talks that she has the chance to take Tramp post in 2020.
On Saturday, she held a regular meeting with the voters; since Tramp entered office, it was its 36th meeting with the voters in the form of a meeting of the Council.
One of the participants asked her whether she planned to be president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to "fix" our broken government, and it was necessary for women to be upstairs."
As a result of the killing of Simms, the LSU player was arrested
The Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect of the murder (shooting) of LSU basketballist Wade Simms, held on Friday, was arrested.
At 11:00 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years.
On Friday, the police department published a video of shooting with a request to help identify the person who was able to be recorded on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot at the South University campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Simms got a firewound in the head, which resulted in the end,” said the journalists in Saturday, chief of Murphy J. Paul.
Wade joined his friend, and he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he was involved in the incident, had his weapons and shot at Wade Simms.
During the arrest, Simpson did not resist and was detained in the police office of the East Baton Rouge County.
A young man raised 1 m 82 cm in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts in the past season and gained a average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 game selections.
Gran Pri Russia: Louis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the command tactics gave him a victory on Sebastian Fettel
Since Waltthery Bottas had qualified on Saturday, after he enrolled Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' team tactics would play a great role in the race.
It's already been a good start and practically hanging on Hamilton when he protected his position in the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his companion on the team.
The Fettel first went to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton to the tail of the whole group, a choice that became a decisive choice.
Mercedes went to a pit-stop one round later, and then left behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after a few fights of wheel-to-collearing wheels, struck forward, which led to the unwillingness of Ferrari's inside space, risking to trap after a double movement to protect the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen launched from the back of the network and was at the seventh end of the first circle.
Then he had a majority of the race, holding on his own tyres, to quickly finish, moving Kimmy Rikkonan to the fourth place.
As a result, he went to the 44th circle, but couldn't increase the rate of the remaining eight circles, as Reichkonen took the fourth seat.
The day seemed to be difficult because Waltthery did his fantastic work on weekends and showed real nobleness by sharing it with me.
The team has done such exclusive work to have a few tricks in stock," Hamilton said.
Traitorous sign language
President Donald Tramp criticized Senator Diane Fainstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her claim that she did not announce a letter from Christine Blacey Ford, accusing Bretta Cavano, a candidate for the Supreme Judge in sexual harassment.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention directly the testimony of the Fords before the Senate Legal Committee, saying that the participants in the Senate showed that these events were “false, disgusting and false people”.
“The only possible response to all of this, and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate is wonderful, it is anger, anger, disgusting and lie” he said.
"You see all these flows, and then they say, 'No, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you send information?
Do you remember her answer... did you "prove" the document's information? - "What, what?"
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Yeah, stop.
We did?... No, we didn't swim," he added with the intonation of the senator.
In July, Finstein sent a letter with a detailed statement of accusations made by Ford against Cavano, and in early September it was illegally proclaimed, but Phinestein denies that the fleeing occurred in her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, but I did not add it to it”, said Finstein to the Committee, according to the Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information in secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denyed the prosecution of the fleeing appears to be unlikely to the president who commented on this during the Saturday meeting: “This is what I tell you: I have failed her tongue of the body.
She may not have “flipped”, but the language of the body was the worst I've ever seen.”
Continuing to defend his candidate for the Supreme Judge who was accused of sexual harassment, the President assumed that democrats used these charges for his own purposes.
"They are definitely trying to restore their power in all the ways available.
We observe the uglyness, disgustingness, and they don't care who they will insult, whom they need to cross in order to get power and control," the Mediaite quotes the president's words.
Britain elite hockey League: Dandi Stars 5-3 Belfast Jayants
Patrick Duyer put two naked, for "Jayants" in a game against Dundy
In the game of the Ellite Hockey League, Dandi Stars paid for the Friday defeat against Belfast Jayants, wining a responsive match on Saturday with 5-3 for Dandi's benefit.
"Jayants" received an early advantage in two goals due to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviler's hits.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Dwighter brought the Jayants into leaders.
François Bushar compared the Dundi account before two goals of Lucas Lundwald Neilsen had strengthened their victory.
For the people of Adam Kiff, who won the Dundi victory with account 2:1 in Belfast on Friday night, this was the third defeat in the season of the Ellie League.
This was the fourth meeting in the season when the Jayants won three previous matches.
The first goal of Dwighter came for the fourth minute at 3:35 after the Kendall McFoll's goal with David Rezerford support, and then Boviler doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the starting period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marcuardt equipped Cooney to equip the account at 15:16.
Dwighter made sure that the Jayants had taken the initiative in the first break when he slaughtered the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The masters were regrouped, and Bushar re-equalised the account, whispering the naked at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Neilsen to give Dandi the first time for the game to take the lead at the end of the second period, and then he and his team have won, and to support the rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
Giants, currently lost four of the last five matches, are headed to Milton Caines for the next match on Friday.
Aviation controller died for hundreds of people on the plane to avoid earthquakes.
The Indoneian Air Inspector was post-deathly accompanied by the hero name after he consciously died in order to make a plane with hundreds of passengers a safe flight.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared without news as a result of a severe earthquake on Sulaveza on Friday.
Many of the inhabitants of the city of Palu were under the fractures of buildings.
Although his colleagues were escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a horrible dispatch at the Mutiar Sis Al-Juffrey Airport, the city of Palu.
He remained on his seat to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the airplane, was able to fly safely.
Then, when he felt that the tower was falling down, he jumped off it.
Later he died in the hospital.
The representative of the Indonesian Air Navigation, Johannes Sirait, stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News Agency.
We prepared a helicopter from Balickpapan in Kalimantana to get him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatchman was dead before the helicopter was able to sit in Palo.
“We regret this loss,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims of the earthquake could be achieved by thousands of people because, according to the information of the Agency for the Elimination of Natural Disasters, access to the towns of Dongal, Sigi and Bouthong was limited.
“The number of victims may grow, since a large number of people are still under fractures and many have not been able to get out of there” said the representative of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves at the height of six meters have desolate the city of Palo, where the mass buried the dead on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: “The ambulance brings the victims every minute.
There's not enough water.
Mini-markets are broken everywhere."
Ian Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, says CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross workers are already rushing to help survivors, but we do not know that they will be there.
The tragedy has already taken quite serious scales, but it may be much worse."
President of Indonesia Joco Vidodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and spoke to the armed forces of the country, in particular saying: “I ask all of you to work day and night to perform all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?” says CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered from the earthquake in Lomboc, which resulted in more than 550 deaths.
Air Niugini now reports that one person was missing after the crash of the lagoon aircraft.
Aviation company, which carried out a crash flight in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now reported that one person had disappeared, while all 47 passengers and crew were said to leave a drowning plane safely.
The Air Niugini report states that, as at Saturday Day, it has no information on one male passenger.
The airline stated that he cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and police, trying to find this person.
The airline was unable to immediately respond to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local sailors helped to save other passengers and the aircraft team after he fell on the water, trying to land at the airport of the Hook Island.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all were stable.
The causes of aviation accident and the precise sequence of events remain unacceptable.
The airlines and the U.S.A. claim that the aircraft landed in the lagoon near the landing bar.
Some witnesses claim that the plane was unable to land on the landing bar.
The American passenger Bill Janes says that the plane was getting on the airline too low.
“ And this is very good, ” adds Janes.
Janes told him and other passengers that they were able to go to emergency exits on a drowning plane, since the water level was by the belt.
He also said that the stewardesses panicked and screamed on board, and that he had a light head trauma.
The US MS reports that sailors who repaired the harbor nearby also helped to rescue by using a boat on which they delivered people to the shore before the aircraft flooded about 30 feet (100 feet).
Air Safety Networks show that in the last two decades aviation accidents with companies registered in PNG killed 111 people, but none of these disasters had anything to do with Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst has been able to prove the fact that a woman is burned alive
On Saturday, the accusation raised a case against a man accused of the burning of the resident Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett presented several hours of testimony as an expert witness in the field of exploration.
He told the members of the Department how he used the cell phone records to make a common picture of action by 29-year-old Queenton Tellis and the 19-year victim of Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett told him that he received data on the location of these people from several mobile phones; according to this, Tellis spent time with Chambers, which was contrary to his previous testimony, reports the Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information he received, his mobile phone was close to Chambers; when the circumstances found out, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford whether Tellis was telling the truth that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that “it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to telephone calls, they called only for one week.
Rowlett also showed that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he removed its text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He removed it from his life, ” says Hale.
The defence should come to the presentation of its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the process to be transferred to the jury later the same day.

Another black?
New York nanny tried a family couple because of racist texts
The New York nanny tried a family couple for discriminatory dismissal after a woman received a complaint that the nanny was “one more black”, which the woman had wrongly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
Marriages deny that they are racist, claiming that the lawsuit is filed with “the purpose of extortion”.
Lyncy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed anxiety to know that the new nanny offered by the childcare service, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived in her family for her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEETH, THAT'S NOT ALL THAT, ONE THAT'S THAT'S BLACK”, said Mrs. Plasco-Flexman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, Ms. Morris made a mistake twice.
Recognizing its deficiency, the Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, saying in the service that the nanny, who was a African American, had done a bad job, and in general that they were expecting a Philippine rather than the African American, reported the New York Post.
Morris paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Morris is now suing the family couple and demands a reimbursement of $350 per day for six months, under the original oral arrangement, which, however, had not been established by a contract.
"I want them to understand: such things are inadmissible," she said, "Post" on Friday, "and I know it is discrimination."
Marriages disagree with the accusation of racism, and claim that Maurice's dismissal could be considered a reasonable step, as if she had been offended, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her what she really didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said Joe Plasco, the Post edition.
"But would you trust your children to someone whom you were rude, even if you were tough, not wishing?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on!"
By calling the case “the defence”, Plasco said that his wife had born a child just two months ago and was in “very difficult situation”.
“And are you ready to persecute a man who is in such a situation?
It is not very nice of you," added the banking worker specialized in investment.
The judicial proceedings are still ongoing, but the public opinion has already condemned in social networks, accusing a couple of inadmissible behaviour and logical issues.
The Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand the move with the speaking bear, says the new letter
The daughter of Bonda, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted by the publication, answered: “It is hard to put myself in place for the first time, before it was published.
It is very fun to know that Paddington has great success."
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a baby book on a bear, had worked as an operator at BBC, and would refer to the refusal of the publication with optimism, and added that the 60-year anniversary of his book publication was “and a joyful and bitter” because their author was gone last year.
With regard to the Meadow Paddington, she speaks about him as “a very important member of our family” and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually became known.
“He was a silent and modest man, ” says his daughter.
“Well, Paddington was so real to him, and it was almost as if his own child had successfully: he was proud of him, though he did not really consider that success his own deserve.
I think that's how he treated Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also had always given the right to the bear himself.”
I was forced to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane, her daughter was transported to the hospital Nicca Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors were thoroughly trying to save her life.
“Nad regularly called and said it was really bad, something went wrong,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza.
"Then he called again and said that she would die in the next two minutes, and that we should say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medicinal products that the doctors gave her, making her heart work, gradually stopped by leaving her body.
She died before she was expected.
I had to just sit and wait for it, knowing it's all coming to the end.
I couldn't cry, cry or cry because there were other people, other families around me.
I had to hold myself firmly in my hands."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan Laperuza, the grief of her daughter's loss, sat on a plane along with other passengers, reconciling with the huge loss she had just had to survive.
“No one around knew what happened,” she said.
“ My head went down, I kept crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was just during the flight I experienced this absorbing feeling of compassion for Nada.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her."
Women surviving the loss of their loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphrey are placed on the Wales Bridge with comfortable words and phone numbers that people can contact for support.
The son of Mrs. Davis Tyler was 13 when he was depressed, and at his age of 18, he killed himself.
“I don't want other parents to experience the same experience I experience every day, ” she says.
A 45-year-old Davis living in Lydney tells her son was a great cook and had a damn charming smile.
“Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiles, the room seems to be lighting."
However, before he died, he left his job because he had suffered the real scary times.”
This happened in 2014, and Tyler, who killed himself, found his own brother, who was 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am not stopping afraid that a chain reaction will take place.”
Mrs. Davis made these cards, "to make people know that there is someone you can contact and tell you everything, even if it's your friend.
You can't sit down and silence, you must talk to people."
Ms. Humphries, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, who had lived 15 years, and he was gone shortly after his mother died.
“He did not say that he felt depressed, frustrated or something like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his mood.
He was particularly sick on Christmas: he didn't even look at children when they opened their gifts."
She says that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through this, this event shook our family.
It broke it off on the part.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Bretta Cavano hangs on the hair: the FBI is starting an investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked -- an investigation limited to time and volume, we could bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee is "disturbed" on the basis of a growing party chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Cavano and his republican counterparts not want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their hesitations.
The intermediate elections will only take five weeks, 6 November, and if everything is expected to go bad for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want and to elect him as the Supreme Judge of the country.
George W. Bush called the senators by lobbying the support of Mr. Cavano, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush since then, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who was then a private secretary of Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which is currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Cavano could receive at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would allow the Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the issue of equality of votes and to confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court of Justice.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased in Kim
Since Kim Chen Yen came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean deficiencies in South Korea decreased, said the South Korean legislator.
Been Seug, referring to the data of the Southern Ministry, stated that, compared to 2706 cases of fleeing in 2011, this figure decreased to 1127 cases last year.
Mr. Park said that key factors had been the strengthening of border control between North Korea and China and the higher rates taken by smugglers.
Phenyan does not give public comments.
The collapsing majority of North Korean refugees is finally proposed for South Korea's citizenship.
Seul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people run across China with the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a safely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers the perpetrators as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often subjects them to forced repatriation.
Relationships between North and South, which are still in war, have been significantly improved in the past months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenjan to resume the negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the June historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Tramp and Kim Chen Yena, in Singapore, where they reached common agreements on the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yoon Ho, accused the United States of impeding their sanctions on progress in this matter.
“If we do not have at least the least confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be able to start disarmament unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in his statement at the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Cavano “histerical” and claims that it is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court of Justice
The Leader of the Minority House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, named Brett Cavano, a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, “histerical”, and said that he was inadmissible for work in the Supreme Court for his temperament.
Pelosi made this comment on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival at Mr. Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman had ever allowed herself to act like this, she would be called "experience" immediately," Pelosi said about her response to Cavano's testimony in the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blacey Ford's accusations of sexual harassment that seemed to have occurred when they were both adolescents.
Cavano was emotionally speaking, and sometimes even screamed and drowned by telling about his family and school years.
He also condemned the democrats of the committee, named the accusations against it “grotesk and clearly planned murder of an acting person”, organized by the Liberals, angry because Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi also said that Cavano had only confirmed by her statements that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had a predominant relationship with democrats.
"I think he discvalifies himself by his allegations, as well as by how he strikes against Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was upset when she was asked whether she would try to bring Cavano to responsibility if his guilt was confirmed, and if the democrats received the majority of representatives in the House.
"I will say, if he does not tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, it is not only suitable for the Supreme Court but also for the court on which he is now," Pelosi said.
Cavano is currently a judge of the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Cavano on the Law of Available Medical Service or Row against Wade, as it was considered a representative of Conservative Justice.
At his candidature, Cavano had examined whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time to put a historical and predicted man into the position of the Supreme Judge, and to shout, “How great!”, says Pelosi.
And women must own it.
It's a righteous anger, months and years of anger, and she can't go through it without tears.
“ When we are angry, we cry, ” said Miss Steinham 45 later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think?'
She continued: "A woman who worked somewhere for the leadership was very helpful to me, and she said she was crying when she was mad, but she developed a technique that explained to her companion, "You can think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really angry."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed by this approach."
The tears are permitted as an outbreak for anger partly because they are incorrectly treated.
One of my most painful memories of the first job in the office where men were dominated: once I cried from anger, but I was caught by an older woman, a wretched manager, which I always feared, and cried to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
They do not know that you cry from anger.
They think you are upset, and they are rejoiced that they have finally brought you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Congressman from Democrats from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential elections.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught on some non-exact interest and left the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there were no reasons to hinder her as President.
“That decision was not considered well” she admitted to me with a smile of 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates have already participated in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case "Snow and Seven Patutes."
The campaign was already at the end, she was very deprived of gathering funds, and therefore she swore that she would not participate in the race unless she gathered two million dollars.
It seemed to be a totally losing option.
She found that some of her advocates, who gave $1,000 to men, only offered 250.
“What am I for them, a rewarded goods, is it?” she wondered.
When she spoke, announced that she would not be conducting a formal campaign, she was so enshrined by emotions — thanks to the people who supported it, disappointment by a system that has made it difficult to gather money and access to the voters, as well as by anger because of sexual discrimination that it was suffocated.
"You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalls how the press responded to it.
"I thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I still thought, what would they write on my monument?
"She has no end of crying?"
How can trade war with America be useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first trading wars between the United States and China have been deaf, and although the battle is far from the end, division among countries can benefit Beijing in a long-term perspective.
Donald Tramp, President of the United States, made the first warning at the beginning of this year, taxing the main Chinese export products, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week when new tariffs affected the amount of $200 billion (150 billion), in fact taxing half of all goods in China.
Beijing every time has been inflicting equal responses, recently setting up shipments to US goods at $60 billion from five to ten per cent.
China promised that responses against the United States would be equal every time, and the second largest world economy would hardly begin to experience at least the smallest difficulties in the near future.
To force Washington to retreat means to resign, but the US public retirement would be too shameful for the President of China.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing could correctly play its maps, the pressure of the United States trade war could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to economic collateral in any of these countries, indeed is much more dangerous than observers had previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a scientific officer of the New American Security Centre of Analysis (Center for New American Security) specialized in Asia.
Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “prepared” to return refugees
Syria states that she is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is looking for assistance in the reconstruction of the country that has been devastated by the war for more than seven years.
On speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Valid al-Mualem reported that the conditions in the country were improved.
“The situation in the field has now become more stable and safe because of the success of counter-terrorism” he said.
The Government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live there peacefully.
All the conditions for voluntary return to the country that they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily life have now been established.
UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for helping to restore the destroyed country.
But he emphasized that the country would not accept assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe strengthens the victory on the Rider Cube in Paris
The team of Europe won the Rider Cube 2018 by defeating the United States team with a summary of 16,5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The European Rider Cube has been lost six times in a series of times, and the European Rider Cube has not won since 1993.
Europe returned its crown by the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who gained 14.5 points needed to conquer the United States.
The American star, Phil Michelson, who persistently fought the majority of the tournament, made his first long-term blow on the 16th hole of par-3, steped away from Francesco Molinari's match.
The Italian golfist Molinari won in all its rounds, became 1x4 players who had ever been 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spith was defeated by the 5:4 player with the lowest rating in the European team, Turbirn Olesen of Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, departed 2:1 of Jana Polter from England, who may have been participating in the Ryder Cube last time.
The Spanish Serchio Garcia, the veteran of eight Cubes of Ryder, became a winner of the tournament throughout Europe with 25.5 points for career.
“ I usually don’t cry, but I can't hold up today.
It was a complicated year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cup again.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He transmits a torch to his co-made John Rem, who won the American golf legend on Sunday, Tyger Woods, accounting for 2:1 in a single game.
"I am incredibly proud of this victory -- I grew up watching the game of Tyger Woods," says 23-year-old Rem.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These indicators are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all times winning 14 main titles only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. congregation struggle during all weekends, trying to successfully. The exemption was made by Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed a golf of the highest class during the whole tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furick said after his team was uncomfortable: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we were able to slightly flip Europe.
It didn't work.
We're taking off the hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played great.
We regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Committee of the Rider Cube, and we will move forward to success.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud of being their captain.
We need to know how to lose.
We have lost."
Redflow: News The concentration of micro-organisms decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasote
The latest report of the Florida Commission on Fish and Wild Nature reflects the overall decrease in the concentration of the Red Gulf in some parts of the area of the Bay of Tampa.
According to FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Color, wealthy flowers are reported in the areas of the districts of the Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota and Color, which indicates a reduction in the concentration of micro-organisms.
The Red Flower is extended approximately 130 miles of the coast line from the northern Pinelle to the southern regions of Lee.
The flames can be observed approximately 10 miles from the Hillsboro district, but compared to last week, the number of them decreased significantly.
The Red Flower is also observed in the district of Pasco.
Last week, the average concentration in the district of Pinellas and close to it was reported, from low to high concentration in the coastal area of Hillsboro, high concentrations in the districts of Manati and Sarasota and coastal zones, the average concentration in the district of Charlotte, the high concentration of the coast of Lee, and the low concentration in Collier district.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Colorer, there is still a chance of irritating respiratory paths.
In Northwest Florida, such a probability has not been reported last week.
