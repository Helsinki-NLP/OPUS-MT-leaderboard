She washed her dirty hands before her food.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left high drinking on the table.
There's no beer over the glass after all day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
I'm still satisfied with my work.
Do you really need help?
Being you, I'll ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's the map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to that meeting even though I was invited.
Are you still here?
I thought you were dating Tom.
I have to go to the next station.
That dream was a mystery for me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for it.
Tom's obviously lying.
So straight and right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the refrigerator?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to call you again.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's gonna be 13 tomorrow.
Cut the meat on thin plates.
I can't watch him ruin his life.
Do everything with reason.
I only buy a soft toilet paper.
Yes, you have to.
We got up to the top of the Mount Fuji.
Me and my wife want to go with you to Boston.
Remember what she was like?
That belt's too close to me.
Playing fago isn't easy.
She took that job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom was hesitating to mention that theme.
We're drinking a lot of beers in our house.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it to Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Ancient customs are extinct today.
Tom's still busy.
You'd better go now.
Tom's infant.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train must have stopped because the tree was fallen on the railways.
What was Tom yelling at the crowd?
He's a perfect husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to the party in the suits of the 17th century.
Are you satisfied with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I admired Tom once.
With great effort, he climbed on the tree.
Translate the Czech text is very difficult.
Tom's probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing too.
We already know that, Tom.
I'm glad you made me notice.
I missed breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I'm not home a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skills qualify him for that job.
They're falling crops.
She was alone in darkness.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
You got a pen?
They don't help.
I like the tie.
We weren't doing as good as we wished.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you fight with Joanna?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered with black clouds.
I need it more than you.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom's got a slipper.
What should I do in this situation?
You're driving a train to school?
Tom's not going to school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who's Tom going to visit?
It's Tom, not Mary.
Why don't you ask me a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I don't know exactly what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I'm not surprised if that happens.
He's free.
People don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his legs carefully.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was as happy as a mud when she got the recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time at his computer.
We wouldn't be in this shame if you were to help us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He'll visit his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could someone live in such a place?
It's rained for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sang in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There's not enough chairs in the conference room.
Tom hasn't recovered.

This bridge used to be a valuable bridge.
He was waving on her.
I came late to school this morning.
I attended the search.
Sam went straight to bed.
We shot on the grass at the river.
Tom never drank hard alcohol.
Tom doesn't like to work.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what.
Tom caught Mary's hand.
I'm totally happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I'm not gonna be there.
Tom was playing with Mary tennis yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
The walls were half down here.
I spoke English to him and found out I could make a deal.
Tom had to run.
I see the book.
Did any of you ever talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
The fence is freshly burned.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You're fat.
We should win.
All replies must be written according to the instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and didn't come back.
Did you bring the book?
I'm not daring to open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting divorced with her.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father came from?
Who are you?
Did you do this inclined?
There were absolutely no doubts.
I don't want anyone else to read it.
If I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Get up there and see it better.
He's old enough to stand on his own.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a ridiculous attack.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
Better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed they'd postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he's saying.
The wedding was last week.
I still eat.
The horse's cutting.
I borrowed Tom's hive.
I'm boring.
I'm writing my will.
I'm not like that anymore.
You won't believe what Tom just told me.
Mary doesn't have anyone to talk to, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If it's not raining tomorrow, we'll go to the tour.
Try to talk to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Bartender, I'll have a drink.
Do you like strawberries?
She used to be bigger.
I suppose he's gone home.
I was in the woods.
Tom's drunk.
He asked me to wait there before he returned.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd rather get back inside.
She doesn't have to do it.
I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school Sunday.
He's got his own house.
I don't usually do that tonight.
Why do you want me to ask them for help if we can handle it ourselves?
I was expecting them to tell the truth.
Put it under the corner.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's screwed.
Tom didn't want Mary to lose.
Tom's home.
Drop the balloon to Tom.
I'm insulting her.
Was the police involved in this?
We like kids.
I wish I was a better man.
You're stealing, huh?
Tom's got to fry.
You should consult your attorney first.
You're a good journalist.
That's what Tom's used to.
I love this book.
The waste is stuck again.
When I got home from work, I found out that someone stole our apartment.
Read the book.

You're really boring.
I like the German movies.
This works.
Stop screwing.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not happy.
Can the message be true?
It's easy to get, it's easy to get rid of it.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
If I hadn't helped her, I would never put the test on.
You wouldn't be happier if I told you.
Can you translate from French to English?

Well, let's have lunch.
We should give him a gift.
