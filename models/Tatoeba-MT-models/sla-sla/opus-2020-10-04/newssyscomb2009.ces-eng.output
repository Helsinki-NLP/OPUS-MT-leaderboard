The triumph of right populists in Austria, totally 29%
The clear weakening of both sides of the present large coalition and significant strengthening of the right-populist parties have brought the first preliminary Sunday preliminary parliamentary elections in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered strong losses, where the position of President Wilhelm Moltera is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Corutan Heitman Jörg Haider is preparing a triumfal return to national policy.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 per cent of votes, but 5,5 per cent of votes are lost against the last elections of 2006.
Even worse, ÖVP was lost with 25.6% of almost nine percent of the votes.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in the Austrian war history and especially in people who have caused early elections, literally a catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP came out of the coalition, people had a significant impact in preferences before the SPÖ.
However, the voters were obviously punished for letting the government lose.
In the first responses to the results, speculation on the possible resignation of the President of the Party and the original Vice-Cantice Wilhelm Moltere.
The observers believe that this could happen on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the President of the Party.
Such development would apparently facilitate the way to the still most likely outcome of the election result, i.e. to renew the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both legally populistic parties - free (FPÖ) previously received 18 per cent and BZÖ 11 per cent of votes - however, social democrats also expressed concerns about the repetition of 1999, when people agreed with populists (the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 BZÖ declined) to the common government, which even caused sanctions by the European Union.
Haider, who has already declared that he is willing to cooperate with any party and assumes to return to Vienna to the full state policy.
The Party of the Greens has also arrived in Parliament, which has easily lost and fallen between the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
None of the other parties appear to have overcome the four per cent border and has not reached Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool
If the problem with Czech scientists who were accused in India of the illegal collection of bugs would not be resolved, the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs, Karl Schwarzenberg, according to the Czech-Indicated Minister, would have a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister stated it in New York after today's meeting with his Indian Proteeb Pranab Mukherd.
"If this could not be resolved, then yes, there would be a certain cooling," he stated after the meeting that was made from the Czech initiative.
After the negotiation, Mukherji said that it could be hard to interfere with the judicial matters.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Peter Swash, who was exempted and punished by a penalty, the central government may deal with the local government in Darjiling, whose jurisdiction is in question.
"His problem could be solved," the Minister said.
For Emil Kucher, sentenced to three years to prison, Mukherji's best to respond to a higher instance.
He could then ask for bail release and wait for a sentence on freedom, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also expressed himself in negotiations.
"He recommends appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to be pardoned," said the boss of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can enter the whole matter is to provide convicted "competent legal support", the Indian Minister stated.
At the same time, he said that such assistance is already provided by the Indian Party.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining best relations with India that have long-term tradition.
The Indians also recognize that," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as CTC said, he emphasized before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of the Czech entomologists.
"We consider it a really deep mistake in prison and accusation of these Czech scientists," he said.
Answers to whether the Indian party has received a promise to deal with things, the minister avoided.
"I've already received quite enough promises," he said only.
Czech judges the struggle for the seabed
It approaches a wall electronic map, on which Australia is illustrated and suitable marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it and the nearest seabed.
The area is large as a continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member United Nations Division of Oceans and Sea Law.
His boss, Director of Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, watches and complements the interpretation sometimes.
There's a work elean and anxiety here.
The seabed is still hiding a little famous world, rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, reds and other non-ravel raw materials here, but also unknown living organisms that have the key to develop cancer.
A day greater than the land
The coastal states have now become vegetable for new submarine territories.
According to the United Nations Convention, they are using their rights that were agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of a so - called continental shelf, which often touches up a few hundred miles from the coast of the country.
It is, according to the Convention, exclusively entitled to all continental shelf sources.
"Simplifiedly, for the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its floor, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It strikes beyond the coastal sea, often even beyond two hundred maritime miles, so called exclusive economic zones," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the determination of the external borders of the continental shelf must be submitted by a comprehensive scientific documentation based on many expensive research and measurements.
It is the result of a number of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications — Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only three last mentioned countries have yet been successful," Mikulka adds.
The world's announcement has recently recorded the success of Australia, which was the first substantially expanded by its submarine countries.
But he also obtained New Zealand - the size of the seabed, which the Commission admitted last week, is approximately 1.6 million square miles, which is approximately six times larger than the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
In the future, the profit that they will benefit from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other States shall submit their requests gradually.
They can do that until ten years since they ratified the Montego Bay Contract.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean dno begins with a convention declared "the common heritage of mankind".
There's no state here, none of the exclusive positions.
The law of burden in this area shall provide the Convention established by an international institution.
"The seabed but there is no Klondik," director Mikulka said in the superiority with his "single areas are legally defined and their regime is treated."
Pacific cereals
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other countries of the former eastern bloc within the Common Organisation "Interoceanmetal".
It was received in 1991 according to the Convention, as well as investors of a few other countries, the status of the so-called "capital investor".
He has the right to grab in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific, which lies between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The investor is a little bigger than Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is partial, it's some submarine replica Tater.
"There can be a total area of 75,000 square miles.
The area is a rich foundation of polymetal concretes containing nicles, copper, cobalt and mangan," says another lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian Division of Rober Sandev brings one such concretion to the presentation.
It reminds of a little potato or, in a little fantasy, a great scheme, which, according to legends, resurrected Golem.
Germany's special planting units were released by hostages
The Egyptian government has asked for assistance from Germany in addressing the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation came up, special units were prepared, but there was no placement.
The public has gradually received further details of the circumstances of the release of 11 abducted European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministries of Defence and Interior, German special forces were involved in the rescue.
According to the statement of the Ministries, both the experts of the Federal Army and the members of the anti-terrorism group of the German Police GSG9 were released at the site, as well as experts on logistics from the Technisches Hilfswerk Service.
However, according to the further communication of the speakers, both ministries from Monday afternoon were not required by the German forces because the kidnappers left their captives and fled when they recognized the signs of violent release.
The Egyptian government said the assistance offered by Germany was accepted as supportive forces for action in place.
"Thanks it didn't happen," said one of the speakers of the General Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers abducted a group of passengers composed of five Germans, five Italians, one Romania, and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19th in southern Egypt.
After kidnapping in the desert region in southern Egypt, they moved hostages in border territories between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained uncertain until the last minute, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
Currently, savings are fine in Cahira.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of hostages is in the care of the German embassy.
He did not express himself to the details of his release.
There is yet no information available in Berlin when saving will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" list, all five tourists should fly with special forces from one of the Airbus German aircraft and to Germany on Tuesday.
The American House of Representatives rejected a rescue package
The first compartment of the US Congress has left a close majority to fall a rescue package for financial markets worth $700 billion.
The Dow Jones index has fallen in a lot.
In relation to 206 to 227 votes, the American House of Representatives rejected a government rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of the President of America, George W. Bush and the leaders of both parties, no majority has been found for the programme that should mitigate chaos on the financial markets.
Desperately, the advocates tried to convict $700 billion's criticism about a package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, called before the vote of the Member to speak consent, even though, as he said, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index has fallen by more than six percent, or by 600 points.
The reason was that the investors were concerned that a state rescue package could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index was raised so that, after the notice of the loss of the package, the collapse would fail again.
Experts now count on other serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order to enter into force the programme, the agreement of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel agents record increasing numbers of bookings
It seems that the winter will be good for German businesses in travel:
According to one study, he increased at the next month's reservations in comparison with the previous year significantly - to the winter season by even more than 30 percent.
Despite the weak economic growth, the taste of the Germans remains to travel indefinitely.
During the winter season, travel offices recorded an increase of 31 per cent compared to the same period last year, as Germany’s travel union (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study of the GfK Institute for Market Survey, there are already increased numbers of bookings available for the autumn months.
According to DRV, the turnover was approximately 11 per cent higher in comparison with the year 2007.
The basis for these results is the numbers of GfK, which assesses the data of 1200 German travel offices each month and interpolates them to the total market.
This result included the travel bookings that took place by the end of August 2008.
Because of a weak dollar course, the trips to the United States are requested primarily, stated the DRV.
In these trips, a reservation increase is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, and domestic waters are particularly targeted in the Germans.
The organized trips are primarily in course, said President DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising energy and food costs, there are costs "for the customer, easy to rest than for individually organised holidays".
Laepple explained that money consumers can save, inter alia, by using discounts for temporary reservation or offers all-inclusive.
Even during the summer months, the number of bookings was very good, so in comparison with the previous year, the higher turn will be again recorded - even though, according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip has fallen compared to the previous year.
My first Octoberfest
Doeconomic repeated poppy, beer of dumbs and varieties from known designers.
It's the first time on the beer bowl.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much to do with it.
She's a blonde, television moderator, and she's wearing a sewed shelter.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is from the secondhand.
But one thing is connecting us: we're not even three minutes on a beer bowl, and we're being thrown by photographers and filled with memory cards -- that's my flatter, because I'm on the Octoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can be friends.
Looks like my cheap crown has fulfilled his goal.
I'm here as a tourist, and I live north of the sausage equation, so my comfort was rather limited.
But right after the arrival in Theresienwes, it's all better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a woman's coat or skin pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassingly affected - everything is completely normal.
The special views at the chocolate bananas are only my scratch.
One Mnich's reminds me that I had wrong tied her, "Left you are free, in the middle of a virgin, right in, behind widow."
They're going to sweat up to the back to the left.
"Okay," he says and laughs.
Others with subtle flirting techniques don't care so much and they're wearing simple pulp hats with the title "This drunk to get dressed!" and squeezing on the circuit naked ass.
A young man with such exhibitionistic tendencies is named Bob, is from England and has arrived at the Octoberfest for the first time.
He looks like "gorgeous", with a prolonged "ooo".
That tells me after he reliefed for just a drinking master.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks they're wastebaskets.
So Bob is one of the frightened Wildbieslers, as it is said in Bavorsk in the public, freely urging people.
Other luck to get rid of alcohol like this.
About eighth evening, they run around the plane where the Octoberfest is doing, heavily healthcaremen who have to take care of poor drinkers.
Medicines always appear in the jaws - in four they wear covered noses from the tent to the tent.
They work like most visitors drinking bowls: empty there, full again.
Who's lying under the sail of this coffin of mile, can't see.
"That's those who can't go on," he calls me in answer to my question, one of the doctors and disappears in the crowd.
The police published the name of the victim of the accident.
The name of a 30 - year - old woman who died in the hospital after her car hit in Essex.
The incident on Shenfield Road at Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carol Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was transported to Queen's hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, an 11-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of a reluctant ride.
He was already released on the police bail.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are enlarged
Long before Turkey started trying to enter the European Union, the European powers were to enter deeply into the Turkish border.
On the eastern coast of Bospor, perhaps only 20 steps in Asia, there is one of the best memories of this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
The Hydarpash railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the non-orenesans.
Then the tourist guides will tell you.
The building is sitting around at the end of the attic with a tower on every corner of the front, in view of unrecognizing from a provincial German council.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is falling down slowly.
But once a person gets inside a knocked treasure, he can no longer have doubts about the size of the company whose westest gate was the station.
The station in August 1908 opened a German consortium Anatolio-Bagdad corporation.
Germany, which has been involved late in the game of empire, had intention to implement its ambition to control the Middle East through this railway to lead to Damascus, Bagdad and on the territory that is Saudi Arabia today.
But German empire ambitions have fallen down during the first World War.
Their railways were attacked by Lawrence from Arab and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding territories, arising from the freezed borders of the cold war, is gone.
The British and Colonial Units went out of Egypt and pushed Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And bad news came to the Hydarpach station.
In 1917, the explosion of the ammunition train was destroyed by its processed roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
From then on, she's gradually drilling, and history's over her.
But today, this gate to Anatolia and on the east serves - at least symbolically - to emphasize the widespread spectrums of Turkish diplomacy.
The Ruling Party of Justice and Development - AKP - has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding territories, arising from the freezed borders of the cold war, is gone.
New policy is now being applied - Turkey is engaged.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian Hamas and Fatah fractions, Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To review the parameters of this new policy, I sat on the night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was to meet one of the leading experts of AKP in foreign policy, Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a cadrant ride along the railways that reminded the old world rhythms of the known Night Post Document, I arrived into a Turkish metropole designed as a new town for the secular state that wants to turn back to its Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamic roots, represents the move of the Turkish consensus paradigm.
She woke up suspicion in the west, especially in Washington.
Taxik brought me to the main AKP station, the ultramodern stone and metal building, intentionally built in a developing suburb, surrounded half-deployed business houses and traders in power where middle-time managers in commercial suits - men and women - meet to make rapid morning shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central policyman from almost every other European political party.
The jacket, the tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry.
"The aim of foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its nearest surroundings.
The cold war was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its obstacle.
Today they have to watch the east and the west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
It must have done both of them.
"But sure the moment will come," I asked, "when Turkey may have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "you didn't wish such a decision to take place."
Then he emphasized what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost to remember: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East but also with Kavkaz and the Black Sea surroundings are as well for Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically said, ride along these railways to the east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back to Hydarpash Station, after the next majority of the night, I thought about the two German masters of Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who watched this building build a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they discovered that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, of a substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And when I waited for the ferry back over the Bospor, I remembered that Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe."
So it seems at least then there was no much doubt which continent should have the right to this fascinating country.
Memorial lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford music manager since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrolog, 11 September) was responsible for Guildford's filharmonic orchestra and the congregation.
As part of the district music plan, the excellent congregation of young Proteus established a year.
He was supposed to be 21 years old, but at the last time Proteus sang in 1979, some of us were almost 30 - we simply refused to give up the congregation.
The name "Proteus" (Mythological Shape Changer) represented the willingness and ability of the congregation to enter any music that was presented to him - whether madrigali or Messiaen, whether separately or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptation created by such a young congregation was often impressive, always exciting and all because of the inspiration of the only man and the enthusiasm of music that remained completely unchanged all the time.
How often Tod just told us to "let music speak for ourselves."
He said, "The Composer knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
Then sing it!"
His tactical technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it wasn't either dictator or major.
Whatever the musical standard was, he always picked it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any dirigent was supposed to be fitted in the knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he was directing the Guildford Philharominic from 1962 to 1982.
In the last 40 years, I've reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed by any of them -- and I've been inspired many times.
Todd Handley had such a great combination of sizes and personal modesty.
He hated dirigents who, according to his words, simply "watched around the world one or two blushing peanuts."
Many of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrolog William Woodruff (September 25th) claims that "in 1946 he returned to the economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and also studied at BSc, MA and PhD."
This comes from Woodruff's notes from the Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and then completed a dissertation work on the British Gumaren industry led by Professor J.D. Chambers, and then published it in 1958 as a publication of the British Gumaren industry.
He actually spent years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and summer 1952 at the Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff crossed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philosophy Faculty
"I recommend the exhibition of Josego Vicente Resine "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black-white photos are amazing.
I was captured by simplicity and strong bullets, with respect and respect for the photographed.
Exhibition that shows a lot of emotionality.
Resino can catch magic moments."
Honda will attack her bestseller twice.
In November, Honda starts selling the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the precedent of this one-space vehicle has already had a significant space, it is now offering even more space interior.
The improved engines are connected to this, which increases the comfort of the ride and allows greater fuel savings.
It's evolution rather than a revolution.
That's the second generation of Hondy Jazz.
Although the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, this one-space car has made many changes.
For example, innovative design, new platform, larger dimensions and new engines should be mentioned.
Even before we examine the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz is coming to the market for six years after the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we notice is that Honda needed a shorter period for this model than other producers.
Although in Europe Jazz is a less famous model, on other markets he became a phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the most sales car in 2002, and also during 2008.
Just in Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold on the market since Hondy Jazz.
The second market became an old continent with approximately half a million sold pieces in six years.
Honda, however, puts its goal to increase the sales of the new Jazz in its category.
While in 2007 this Japanese company sold totally 83,000 pieces of Hondy Jazz, the estimates were estimated to be 100,000 cars, which would increase by 17% on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model since 2002, which means 6.7% of the total sale of Hondy in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of Jazz, the leadership of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 pieces per year.
The arrival of a new jazz will allow Honda to significantly reduce sales decline in Spain.
The driving of the car so de facto expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 sold pieces, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share in the Spanish market to 1,8 %, compared to 1,6 % of last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a 5-dimensional hybrid compatible size with a length of 4.37 meters from which the Japanese company promises a global sale of approximately 200 000 pieces a year.
As regards markets, the Japanese producer estimates that 50 % of Insight is sold in the United States, while the remaining percentages divide the old continent and Japan.
The start of Hondy Insight sale is expected in the first months of the next year, as soon as it will be presented to the public in January in Valencia.
In contrast to the first generation, all dimensions have increased in the new jazz.
His length rose to 3.9 meters (five inches higher), a width of 1.69 meters (by two centimeters higher) and the disposal of repairs by 2.5 meters, which means a length of five inches.
On the contrary, the height has not changed and is still at 1,52 metres.
Increasing the dimensions also increased the internal space.
However, this advantage has been achieved by using a new platform, but by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car that has already been used in the previous Hondy Jazz.
Also, the volume of the luggage space - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 liters, by 19 liters more than it made the volume of the luggage space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur at the engine version 1.4, as the volume of the luggage space at Hondy Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement other than external elements - such as the rear LED of light or the possibility of equipped panoramatic roof - is easier access to the back seats.
The doors leading to the second seats allow the angle of opening 80 degrees compared to 67 in the first Jazz model.
In the second generation, Hondy Jazz is new engines.
From the beginning, this small model will be offered with two gasoline engines 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and brings excellent improvements in the engine system, while a high rotating moment in the full range of engine rotations.
The first engine with a volume of 1.2 litres has 90 horses at 6000 rotatings with a maximum rotating point of 114 Nm at 4.900 rotations.
This engine - which had 78 horses in the previous generation of jazz - consumption of 5.3 litres and an emission of 125 grams of CO2.
In contrast to the previous engine that reached 83 horses in the previous generation, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with the performance of 100 horses has combined consumption of 5.4 litres and emissions 128 grams of CO2.
"A car bee" prevents crashes
To progress in the development of technologies protecting against accidents, Nissan was inspired in nature this time, specifically in bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot who takes a model of flying bees, thus preventing the crashes.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in the technology to prevent crashes.
The engineers of the Centre for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. robotk developed in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in Scientific and Technological Research Prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doie, the Director-General of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Mark Development, BR23C is presented as the extension of four zones of Nissana security shield.
Robot is responsible for strengthening the ability to prevent crashes from the vehicles of this mark.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of a owl shape that is very similar to the safety shield of Nissana.
However, the most important are complex bees' eyes that are able to see in all directions in an angle greater than 300 degrees, which allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
The engineers in creating this visual function suggested what they called laser location (Laser Range Finder).
It records the obstacles that are located up to two metres in the range of 180 degrees before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends the signal to the board microprocessor, which immediately transmits it to the warning of the collision.
"The moment the obstacle is recorded, the robotic is illustrating bees movements and immediately change the direction by turning wheels into the right or even greater angle to prevent the collapse.
The greatest difference in any existing system is that all the evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Lab and the main engineer of the project.
Robot cannot move in a direction up and down, or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to the direction that is allowed by rotating its wheels, but not in the infinite amount of directions and options as a bee.
Therefore, in addition to the acceleration and slowness, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robotic.
"The device only needs to process information every few seconds and be maintained according to these data.
It does not require storage of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, which allows it to work without interruption with only two dozen kB memory.
You may be surprised, but we don't even talk about giga or mega."
This is the first step in developing new technologies to immediate conflict prevention, technology in which Nissan predicts use in serial cars in ten years.
Robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and endure longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of a unit into the GPS satellite navigation system that would lead the drivers to the target and avoid obstacles on the road.
Enjoy your fear before you take the mortgage
It should be recognised that the U.S. Ministry of Finance, in addition to having sufficient capital for injections, does not miss either inventory.
He faced a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages at banks with doubtful solutionability, he created a popular-scientific game on the Internet "Bad Credit Hotel".
Or "Hostle of Bad Loans"... or a confused hotel.
The hotel and especially its reception seem dark to make a person once, twice and three times think about whether the right time is to ask for credit.
And especially where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, even though you are not too detailed.
It's a site more suitable for youth than a place for the whole public.
And what happens when the game's over?
There's a dream room inside the hotel.
At least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital MUFG
The banking house Morgan Stanley announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the biggest Japanese bank that would spend nine billion dollars to gain 21% of its capital. The adoption of this report carried out a significant decline in its course on the market.
On a week after they discovered their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that the IUFG would buy 9.9% of the regular shares of Morgan Stanley at a single price of $25.25, which represents a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % than the value of securities by 31 August.
The MUFG Bank invests another six billion dollars in acquisition of convertable securities which provide 10% of the profit and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the whole operation would be performed on the basis of the average unit price of $29, i.e. 28% under its current course.
Morgan Stanley's shares still lost 6.79% and reached $23.07 around 17.00 in Greenwich.
"This strategic merger is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the statute of banking holding," explained John Mack, Director-General of this American Group.
The new Statute adopted Morgan Stanley last week, which allows him to distinguish his activities, but it also places him under the surveillance of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest eso from Wall Street to take a far more careful approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday, inter alia, indicate that the agreement has been modified during the last few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that it will sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for approximately $8.5 billion.
"We thought a week ago," explained Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, that our participation would consist exclusively of common shares.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to limit risks to minimum and also hide."
On the basis of the weighted average price, the MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley's securities by 7 % less than their account value.
And the operation will result in reducing profits from the stock by about 20%.
The Agreement assumes that the IUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities in a common share in a year, if the last named items are to be exchanged by 50 % over the exchange price, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that brings the MUFG will allow him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance and increase his cash.
However, the Talk Group refused to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of both new allies.
After IUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should be praised by the ratio of Tier One's payment eligibility about 15 %, that is one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that since the end of August, he "sensitively" decreased his balance.
The last weeks were difficult for the group, since its marketing course fell by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt increased sharply.
These costs took the opposite development on Monday, but remained high, about 12 %.
Last week, she announced Goldman Sachs, the only other "life" from the large Wall Street investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the ransom of Merrill Lynch, that she chose $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quit.
Reiterate the Republic around socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezuelca Huga Chaveze, Bolivian Eva Morales and Rafael Correy Ecuador.
Last Sunday, the third appointment submitted a vote, according to the model of his partners and friends, the proposal for the new Constitution.
And his mission was fulfilled, since 64% of the voters, according to the official results covering 80% votes, voted in the referendum "Yes".
According to these results, 28 %, 7% of the votes were incorrect and 0.7% of the voting tickets were empty.
In order to adopt the proposal of the Constitution, he had to receive half of the votes plus one.
The two studies carried out at the east of the election rooms and the number of non-governmental organizations foretold a clear victory "yes" on Sunday, with 63% to 70% of them.
Rafael Correa, last night from Sunday on Monday, demanded the victory of his proposal of the Constitution.
"The Constitution won the whole line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuador people in the Guayaquil Guayaquil headquarters, 280 miles south-west of Quit.
He understands himself that Rafael Correa received congratulations from Chaveza and Morales, but also from his chile skirt, Michelle Bachelet.
The votes, which, according to the Observation Mission of the United States of America (OEA), took place in peace, related to the text of 444 points that build "new socialism" promoted by the President.
The proposal of the Constitution devotes the power of the State over the economy by threatening the "planing of development" of the country living primarily from oil harvest by foreign companies and the devises sent by its emigrants.
The proposal protected by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the power of the head of the State that will be able to carry out two ongoing four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that this power will be used and will be a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, inter alia, strengthens the principle of free health and education that the President began to introduce in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live under the poverty border.
Finally, it also counts on the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, thus terminating the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuador base as the default point of American drug operations.
19 hostages were released in Chad
The Egyptian command took the assault of 11 tourists and their eighteen escorts who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, held in prison for ten days in the desert, were alive and healthy on Monday to the Egyptian capital.
During the morning, the Egyptian command released them in Chad.
The armies arrived around 15.30, apparently in good shape, on board of a special plane to the Al-Maza military base, who is nearly neighbouring with the international airport in Kahir.
They were immediately transported without being able to express themselves in the press, on board helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, the border residential quarter of Cahira to be subjected to medical examinations.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom was paid to the kidnappers," the Egyptian Minister for Tourism Zohejr Garrana declared on the road of the airport.
Since its captivity on September 19th during safari in a vehicle with a drive of all four wheels on the back of mountain Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages was dragged from one shelter to another 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romania - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border director of the Aegyptous agency, organizer safari.
One leader of the Egyptian security components pointed out that 30 members of the special units who approached the board of two helicopters immediately before the sunrise came to a steak during the night.
"There was a shooting, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said this source who wanted to remain anonymous.
He pointed out that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The chief of the Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, mentioned the role played by the secret agents and folders of Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that this result has been achieved by professional and effective people from our secret services, from special forces," he declared without further specification.
He also rejected that the ransom would be paid.
In the evening, the Sudanese army declared that at the patrol, the vehicle was held with a drive of all four wheels on which the kidnappers were located, and six of them were killed, including the Chadian commander and two arrested.
The army claimed that they were connected to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for Liberation of Sudan - Unity (SLA-U), which immediately rejected the movement.
Letters - Silent majority of the culture resort
The debate on cultural financing is filled with paper titles and is the subject of the pre-election campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still limited.
Who will rise to make the poor amounts provided by small museums, archives, archaeological diggings and national memories that are starving?
Which politicians can relieve the federal government that they will disregard their memories and their historic buildings?
That in Québec, as in Canada, do we not have laws that would really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government devoted three and a half million euros to a restaurant of a chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all the elected representatives and all the regional organizations, in coherence.
In Québek, in the Federation of History Company Québek, it strives to at least 40,000 volunteers joined in 211 companies for history, memory, archives and genealogy on the dissemination of history, the preservation of a bunch of private archives and the protection of archeological remnants for a few small.
Frequently these companies are the watch dogs of our memorials, which prosecutors hopelessly protest when promotors and leaders release their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemetery.
When will we finally meet the tribunes for history and memories?
Benelux's governments will increase the part of the Fortis bank
The states of Benelux will help the Belgic-Netherlands Bank of Fortis, which has first encountered problems in Europe due to the widespread impact of the US hypothetical market, by partial decline: the three countries will support the monetary and insurance institutions which also have capital participation in Hungary, amounting to €11.2 billion.
This weekend, at the highest level, the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed on the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for the Competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first in the euro area which, in the context of the crisis of international financial markets, spreading in waves for more than a year, has reached a major crisis, and the decision made in this matter could be assessed as precedents.
In the sense of the decision that was born Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49%) of the bank's property.
The Bank will, with absolute certainty, sell part of its capital shares, especially then - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch Bank ABN Amro.
The Fortis bank's actions began to fall rapidly last week, and in the second half of the week there were serious signs of crisis in the Constitution.
However, the analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let it crash.
The securities of the company only fell by 12% on Friday to the minimum of 14 years.
Since January, the stock value has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the total market capital value of the group is about 14 billion euros, but it is not real.
The company's leadership is blaming for the fall of the Fortis stock of uncertainty on the foreign market in connection with the adoption of an American package plan worth $700 billion.
The stocks were slightly up on Monday.
On Friday, a new Director-General Philip Dierckx was appointed in the head of the bank.
The monetary institution was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has yet filed.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors should not be concerned, they will not lose their money.
There's no panic among the bank clients, and the branches weren't being attacked.
In Hungary, the Fortis bank has owned a separate branch and bought several leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken
Life insurance and health insurance in America, based on people's data on drug shopping, often denys the possibility to conclude with the insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that evaluates the use of medicinal products in any case for the authorisation of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we confer the chicken of the leaf," quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, the author of the programme designed to monitor the prescription.
Insurance companies shall make insurance and the amounts paid in the case of insurance events dependent on the health of the stakeholders, and if the risk is estimated as too large, the insurance is not even closed with it.
They used to send medical examinations and contracts only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: on the basis of the identification number, the customer from the pharmacist easily finds out what drugs he bought in the last year and a half of which the program himself produces, suffers from the disease and his health condition.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol reduction medicinal products, it refers to a practically uncontrollably high level of blood fat, which immediately puts it into a higher risk category.
There are now several versions of the programme, some also determine the risk coefficient at the same time, so there is almost no job in insurance except paperwork, although there are minor problems.
It is unlikely that lecter medicines can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds are used against migraine or heat inflammation, but are also effective against depression.
They represent a significant factor in the view of commercial insurance, which increases the risk, whereas the firstly appointed difficulties are not.
In order to request and process data, special companies have been established that, prior to obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacists, request the patient’s approval.
The authorities are now forced to do so, even though they were not punished for their independence.
Some companies have recently been processing the results of laboratory studies that link with data on medicinal products that can provide a more precise picture of the health status of patients.
The data has access to more companies, while controlling their use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a special law on health protection, but its effectiveness applies only to health providers and insurance providers.
The proposal of a law which will provide the authorities with the power to control companies specializing in data supply is before the Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: therefore he developed his program so that the data transmission would be bound to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the authorization concerned can barely deny, otherwise insurance contracts will not conclude with it.
So the chickens are just a little relying on the liss of goodwill.
Global Marseilles Menu
The European Union and India will double the trade turn
Since the European Union and India are mutual business partners, they have led this to other issues, mainly global problems, also the ninth series of meetings at the highest level.
Today will also be a French-Indian summit, which will focus mainly on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
Because the European Union recognizes that India is a developing democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to talk to international matters, however, Member States have not yet been able to find a common denominator in the issue of the support of the permanent membership of the New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even further discussed at the last, nineth summit held in Marseilles.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy as the current President of the Union, the respect of the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Foreign Policy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed to double the trade up to five years, or to increase to more than a hundred billion euros.
Since between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 to 55 billion, it is not an excessive ambitious goal.
In legal terms, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been lodged, so it has received green to the future air transport.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that the negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to compare the balance, while the EU is India's first business partner, New Dillie is figuring between EU partners until the ninth place.
The summit also focused on global matters.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respect for terrorism - both parties in all its forms condemned and called for an accelerated conference of the United Nations.
They also urged the end of the trade negotiations from Dauh, although both have a great share in his real failure.
The European Union confirmed that it would insist on its energy and climate programme, because it would like to reduce the emissions of harmful substances by 2020 by at least 20 per cent.
India also agreed, as well as that the global agreement and gas production would need to be reduced by 50 per cent for the next year at the climate conference.
Both parties would also like to prevent the increase in food prices and support the convening of the international conference for the discussion of the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister lands into the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting, the trade in peaceful use of atomic energy is about to be closed.
Paris believes that the authorization of the construction of Indian nuclear reactors worth 20 billion euros will acquire the French companies.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement should be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
Great participation of Italian publishers in the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmess, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international Frankfurt book fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from a hundred different countries to take 171,790 square meters of the industry with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as a honourable guest.
The Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration celebration in the Italian Pavillon: Italy will actually participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italy) – on 264 meters of the square exhibition area.
There will be a press meeting in Room Struktur Buchmesse in pavillon 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to data, the importance of foreign authors in relation to the total Italian production, especially with regard to the literature for children and adults, is still reduced.
Found a plane Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the plane Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3th, 2007, flying over the desert in Nevada.
Thresholds were discovered on one upper edge at the highest of three thousand metres, in the Mammoth Lakes area in Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no human remnants inside the plane.
Sheriff Madera County, John Anderson, raised doubts that remained, "The plane was found, we sent the team there and now we are sure that it was exactly what Steve Fossett flew on the day he disappeared," said on one press conference.
Thus, the sheriff stated that human remains were not found in the aircraft or in the area around.
63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) announced that several hours after the deficit recognition was sent an investigation team which eventually identified the plane: it was exactly Bellanca 8kcab, not known since 3 September 2007 when Fossett left Yerington in Nevada to a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the border with Nevada, some Fossett's personal objects were found by a couple near their accommodation in Mammoth Lakes.
It's two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Air Management, cash and one jacket.
The search for Fosset was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
A billionaire got a place in history thanks to a long championship collection.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man who completed the world's journey in the airball: two weeks of flight alone.
Three years later, the world flyed on the plane and without landing.
Between his many records also belongs to flights at a height of 15,445 meters above Andama, even though with a copilot.
Glk, the ads you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and exactly defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "compatible" jeeps of the star's house, using which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring the faith of the news into this sector.
Just because of its untraditional processing, unexpected and unconventional communications will be accompanied by the marketing of Suv Glk and available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms since the next October 17th.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which accompanies the debut of a new vehicle, also begins an unofficial way of communication by means of a futuristic posting campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy for a car mark.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan Trade Class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication starts with a car presentation in a stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near Corsa Como, will be able to see a new Suv in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, if you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will leave the poster.
Then, using innovative technologies Elumin8, the new Glk will be enlightened in various moments in all its small things, so that it will be reconstituted in a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotype area of car communication.
Will he be able to wake up the interest of future customers?
So we already know who the Italian huligans are.
From Triveneta, they're risking Daspo.
Who are those 150-200 boys and girls for which Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the Ultras Italy group, which has been watching Naziionale azzurra for years, and which has, in fact, never done excessive problems.
She never even met an enemy fan.
The orientation of the group is right.
The founders come from Triveneta.
From Verona, Padova, Terstu is Udine.
In Sofia, few groups from Campania and Puglia joined them.
They have three colored flags that appear to the cities of the origin of the participants: they have been removed on Saturday night so that they are not recognized.
They're inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc gave the Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all to the name, so easily controlled.
And Viminale really checked all of them: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with Dassle, no one who was allowed to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had previous offences from the stadium were rejected tickets and banned matches.
Now Viminale awaits to read the reports coming from the Bulgarian police, then takes action: In this case, Daspo can be given for at least five years to the fans who were arrested or to those who were identified during the eruption.
International Daspo, which is prohibited from visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our chuligans, simply, won't move any more on a stadium.
Fortunately.
But now there is fear of emulation: that means that more than a hundred fifty are joined in.
"We must extinguish this fire immediately and not justify those who act in this way," Viminal confirms.
So, "regularly open eyes, especially because of the national struggle in the Wednesday in Lech."
There's a small core of supporters in Puglia.
Tomorrow, Osservatorio will meet on Tuesday, Casms, which can also count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that cares about the problems on the stadiones.
"The Congregation Leader-Leader and the arms of Momella's hymna? It's not a crime in Bulgaria."
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a very unfortunate way), which is a few weeks director of Viminal Osservatorio (see a place that was previously Francesca Tagliente and then Felicio Ferlizi).
Mazzilli used to be a quevestor in Terst, where the core of the supporters of Ultras Italy was founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says that in Bulgaria there is no crime to celebrate the leader, but of course the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a shame.
"I'm not a sociologist -- the Osservatorian unit is supplied – crimes are condemned to the country in which they have happened.
So far, this group has remained in the limits, and now we'll take a close look at what happened and we'll consider for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistle at Mommy's hymna: it's not a crime, but if you'll let us, it's inconvenience...
