In my view, the literature programme was formed by ladies of the Balsaki age based on their interests.
From Russian literature in the 19th century, we prefered Danielovsky and Volkonsky.
Of course, they wrote the belletrist from the same dates of the Balsaqi age.

Germany: Fourth cure of coronavir is inevitable
The fourth vaccine will take summer or autumn of 2022.
The expert believes that the current vaccine in Germany will not be final, but will continue with the new force.
Despite the active habitat campaign in Germany, neither two or three doses of vaccine from the coronavir, it is likely not enough to protect fully.
This is convicted by the head of the Common Practice Association, Ulrich Weigelt.
Die Welt reported on Saturday, 11 December.
"We expect the fourth vaccine to be required in the summer, the latest of the autumn," believes the expert.
Furthermore, Weigeld hopes that the fourth vaccine from the coronavir can be conducted "in combination with flu vaccination".
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccine can help to combat the proliferation of the new crown of the Omicrone crown.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of reinfected Omicronem is three times higher than Delta or Beta.
This is the result of the preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Consequently, producers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omicron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against infection by the new option of the Omicron coronavir.
Study BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses, the vaccine is significantly below: “neutralization capacity is reduced more than 25 times.”
"It indicates that two BNT162b2 dosages do not provide sufficient protection against omicron-stamp infections," stressed BioNTech and Pfizer.
The third dose is therefore required.
Experts insist on acceleration of the vaccination rate in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, speaks to reduce the interval between the second and third training.
Furthermore, as Salzberger believes, the accelerated vaccine will affect both delta-virus and the omicron variance of the coronation.
"The experience of Israel shows this very convincingly," stressed the expert.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 years old.
Bet-A-Vib is a special branch of Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (as the Kalikana Vib series) is different from the number of other vibes, which was originally created in the light of the use of ice fishing, not only for fishing.
These visions are greater than those nearby analogists, a weight of weight, which undoubtedly affects the niance of the use of these interesting baits.
Another recognised characteristic is the upper flat from a steady and fixed plastic, which creates additional vibrations in vertical and horizontal lines.
As a winter vib, at the bet-A-Vib catch, it shows a pretty aggressive game.
A simple monotone animation is often the most capable, i.e. the movement of the participants up and down almost without pauses.
When planning the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, it is convenient for catching in limited space, underwater plants, corrosions and other obstacles for which a trap is possible.
A small deviation is also relevant in catching the winter of a boat and a large oak, especially in the middle of the winter, when the bait is required by a point and aggressive bait.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib immediately turns and returns to the original vertical.
At least Beth-A-Vib has been successfully applied for winter catches of powder.
In order to satisfy its caprises, you can select from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is capable of irritating the passive rat without even responding to nerves.
When catching Bet-A-Vib, it shows distance and accuracy.
It is understood and not caprisen, well combined with the woods and tied tiles even with large diameters.
In order to catch the rats, the boat, the ersha or the oak, except for the equilibrium, the "step" is relevant, sometimes with "cleaning" at the bottom.
If you're catching in a boiled place, you can change the front triple into a double, which will reduce the probability of traps.
Among the bet-A-Vib baits, among the most sustainable in work and, as a result, one of the most capable.
The same success can be used in relatively small and depth areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36.

Seven thousand Russian mercenaries were claimed in Libya
In Libya, more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company (CHC) Wagner.
The Chairman of the High State Council of the Republic of Khaled al-Mishri said on Sunday, 12 December.
"Now there are more than 7,000 mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also sneak tranchees in Sirta and Coffrey.
They have 30 reactive aircraft in the Gardabia Airport (including the Civil Airport in Sirta)”, said the Anadolu agency.
Khaled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are " trying to capture" the central part of Libya, spreading from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "to bring their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Save Presentation
According to the speaker of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to preserve its presence in North Africa and “settled in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using aviabasa and port in Sirta, as well as the Aviabasa in Jufro, noted in the publication of the agency.
The Russian authorities have officially denyed that the Wagner WHC is using the support of Kremlin.
Where else mercenaries can be
According to the Agency, Wagner is allegedly operating in nine countries of Africa - the CAR, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, the Wagner daughters receive certain privileges and licences for the use of useful digging and natural resources, as well as the delivery of weapons, technologies and military services in those countries,” the article states.
According to the media, the "vagnerers" appeared to have fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not meant either in force departments, nor in the registry of yurlics, and its fighters are not available in the formary lists of personality.
This company is under United States sanctions.
Recall, earlier, 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
The Council of the European Union was expected to adopt this decision on 13 December.
Situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya de facto is the second parliamentary parliament with consultative functions with the dominant Islamists, TACS wrote.
This body repeatedly called for a single day of vote on the election of parliamentary and heads of the State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
"The election remains less than two weeks, and the chances that they will go within time are rapidly reduced," the material notes.
On this background, the High Election Commission of Libya postponed a final list of candidates for an indefinite period, transmitted by the Sky News Arabia Television.
External policy by the Russians' eyes
38 per cent of the Russians see more success in foreign policy than failure, 29 per cent believe that they are failing.
"The examples of success -- "in Syria has protected, restored the world there," "Northern Stream" decision, "the whole world is intimidated by that strong weapon," "We have reversed the crime."
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from the world”, stated in the Study of the Public Opinion Fund.
The Government of Dubai has totally renounced the paperwork, and all the governments have become digital
The Government of Dubai reported that it was fully rejected by the paperwork and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively electronically.
This is reported by the WAM Emirates Information Agency.
"Today, the new phase of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life has been marked -- we have completed the transition to the entire non-pattern Government," said the Emirate Prince, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan ben Muhammed ben Rashid Al Mctoom on Saturday.
The internal and external documentation will now be carried out in all Dubai governments only digitally through special information platforms.
Innovation has affected all without exception of the sector: health, ZCKH, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc., many commercial structures have also joined the Government's initiative.
The transition to the e-government and digitalization of the documentation began in Dubai since 2018.
At that time, as the authorities estimated, 336 million paper sheets were saved, with 14 million hours of human work and $353.8 million in monetary equivalent.
Rather, mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobinin, said that electronic services would save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's production and export of cars fell below the year 2020
Turkey's production and export of cars were sharply reduced in November on the basis of the devaluation of lira.
As a result, the industries of the industry had been worse than last year, Bloomberg reported, referring to the data of the Association of Automotive Producers of Turkey.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were released in Turkey in November, 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
The export was sent to 75.9 thousand vehicles, which was more than 25 per cent declined to the last year.
And if, as a result of the first 10 months of this year, Turkey's car sector showed a positive dynamic by last year, 11 months of 2021 had already been 0.3 per cent worse than last year.
The result of such decline was a rapid decline in Turkish lira, which increased by 29 per cent in November in relation to the dollar.
This led to the decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 IAS subjects have received a credit payment delay in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov told the situation on the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized business, transmitted by MiA Correspondent Kazinform.
“About the information of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the regulation and development of the financial market, in the present year, pursuant to the mandate of the Head of the State of 1 April 2021, the Chairman of the Agency of 9 April 2021 adopted the order for the provision of delay in loans of small and medium-sized enterprises,” Alihan Smailov wrote in his reply to the delegation ' s request.
He recalled that the order for the provision of loan payments provided for banks and micro-financial organizations, the delay of credit payments issued before 1 April 2021 to IAS entities, including IPs, during the period from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The period of delay was between 30 and 90 days of the IAS.
The borrower could have indicated a different period of delay in payments.
During the period of delay with respect to the borrower, the claim and expenses have been suspended, the notification of the need for exemption of the debt, as well as the receipt by the creditor of the commissions and other payments,” noted the enclosure.
For 2021, the second-level banks received requests for receipt of 603 loans borrowers, of which 553 IAS subjects were deferred to the amount of 9.7 billion tengue.

Pulmonologist Purasev assumed that people with weak immunity could easily carry out the Ocmiron type.
The doctor assumed that people with weak immunity could carry it easier than those who have strong body protection response
Pulmonologist Sergei Purasev explained why the ocmiron crown type could be dangerous.
The reason why it is necessary to be searched for in terms of the infection of the virus.
Scientists believe that Ocmiron was born in the body of infected HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
I mean, in mutation, he did not face any resistance to immunity.
That makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no immunity response, it became very quick.
Apparently, there are those spike proteins, the spikes, which may be more than they are supposed to have been cut by their antibodies during mutations, commented the plummonologist Sergei Purasev.
The doctor assumed that people with a weak immunity could be able to carry " ocmiron " easier than those with strong body protection reaction.
Turns out the strong response of the body to anything, any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens when a 30-year-old youth dies, and the 60-year-olds carry it in the form of chish.
The immune reply of the young is completely inadequate: where the finger could only be threatened, he beats like a wowber gun, Sergei Purasev concluded.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
The inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, only symptoms can be purchased -- the whole hope of the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of the intoxication of the body -- temperature, weakness, illness.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficult breathing, coughing in the throat.
Right or left pains, abdominal pains can also indicate a growing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, until the end of the year, they may begin to vaccine a growing generation between 12 and 18 years of age.
Virusologist, head of the IFTI genome engineering laboratory, Paul Volčkov noted that this category was very actively suffering from a skid.
Adolescents who go to school have a maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active flash, as well as the children's gardens, said Paul Volchkov, a virusologist, head of the IFTI genome engineering laboratory.

Immunologists emphasized why people with fatty become victims of quid
The authors studied the fat tissue remaining from bariatrial operations and discovered that fat cells known as adipocytes may be infected by coronavir.
The immune cells located in fat tissue, the macrophages, have also been infected, showing strong inflammatory reactions.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died of quid, and discovered particles of coronavir in fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and flu viruses can be hidden in fat tissue using it as a tank to avoid the response of the immune system.
Probably SARS-COV-2 is capable of this.
Biologist told the reasons for demention
The biological science candidate, Semen Golonejkin, described the causes of demention and reported how it prevented the radio interview of Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is demonstrated by a gradual loss of cognitive functions, and with time, a person is hardly oriented even in the familiar environment.
Golonejkin noted that the demention is mostly caused by neurogenerate disorders, head traumas, certain infections, metabolic disorders and lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of illness development.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behaviour level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activities is possible," he said.
Demention is also affected by dementia - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep-breaks and low-moving lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forgetty, inability to concentrate and reduce abstract thinking.
“The debate is that the loss of hearing may be both the early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and one of the factors of the risk of its emergence,” added the biologist.
In order to prevent the disease of WHO, it recommends that we maintain the necessary level of physical load, train cognitive skills and skills that require memory and logic involvement.
Previously, the Professor of the Neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics of FGAOU in RNIM.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the Cognitive Disorders Division of the Federal brain Centre and neurotechnology, Anna Bogolepova told the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30,000 illegally exported artefacts from the country
In the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return some 30,000 artefacts that have been illegally exported from the country in a smuggling way.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, in the television of Al-Hayat, the Chief Inspector of the Department of the Return of the Ministry of Tourism and the Ancients of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Hauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has recovered 29,300 artefacts.
Only this year, 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Hauad stated that all smuggling artefacts were registered in the archives.
The Department's staff are currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, professionals "track auctions across the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that, when cultural values were returned, they were restored and then exhibited in museums.
He said that one of the returned artefacts was discovered in Belgium by an ancient human skeleton, which is now part of the exposure of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities requested Interpol to help find the auction of Pharaoh Tutanhamon.
The Christie's auction house held trades on 4 July with over 3,000 years of age for $5,97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused displeasure from Egypt.
The Egyptian party also claims that the art subject was illegally taken from the Carnaqi temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanhamon, represented in the image of the god of the sun of Amon, was kept in private collection and has not been traded since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe, unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has actively pursued repatriation of illicitly exported monuments from the country.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the smuggling ancientities are the result of the archaeological findings of black digers.
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account," and that is right, because Crimean Tatars (232,000) are a self-related people (about Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people are living in Crime (see census).
Crimean tatars are a separate nation, and the name of the people is two words!
Only a Turkish language group combines them together.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal staff mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide access to their personal mobile devices, says Financial Times.
In Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not provide corporate communications equipment to its staff, instead offering a acquisition of a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications partner.
Under existing rules, the bank may review information on corporate devices issued to its staff, as they are used to address business issues with colleagues or clients.
The Bank uses the right to verify mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if a staff member used it to meet with a client who was not approved by the Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have moved to a remote mode, the bank wishes to extend this rule to all devices used to address work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's leadership has established a deadline to which staff can meet the new rule.
In Credit Suisse, information on the new requirement is not commented.

Part 4
The last year of the life of Sergei Esenin, 1925, was a productive creative, but the most difficult for the earthly being of the poet and his ego.
He was already out of any literary associations, scattered with imaginism, but is known, excited, sometimes strongly criticized, even evil, but the reader is ready to wear it in his hands.
Over 60 verses were written in the year, many of them -- real arts, a cycle of Persidian motives, the poem of Anna Snow, was issued by 8 books, a collection of Russian Soviet.
At the end of June 25, the Government concluded a treaty with Esena for its composition in 3 volumes.
None of the modern Sergei Alexandrovic poets had received such honor, he was the first!
In addition, it was very good money - the contract pays 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the factory director received 300 bullets per month, 200 Engineer).
The funds that year were needed more than ever.
Assenin married the granddaughter of Lew Tolsto Sophie Tolstoe, the family residence, the sisters of Katja and Sasha, as well as the mother.
It would have been like life to be rejoiced, but it has been decorated mostly in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the Black Man (written in November 1925 and published after the death of the Esenin):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is that the wind whistling?
Over the empty and inhuman field,
As I grow in September,
It's spinning the brains.
Many familiars pointed out that Esenin was very handicapped, badly looked, apparently sick.
It's frequently repeated, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason for this is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis is alcoholism, Sergei Alexandrovic has been treated with someone, there are no credible documents left.
Let's say that on May 1923, when the Esenin insisted on the fourth wife, the American Icedora Duncan corrected his health in the clinic under Paris at Professor Petra Hanuskina (the basis to it will be arrived two years later in Moscow).
Here are the evidence of the poet, the scandals on this ground, the milition's arrays that have been excessively scattered by dozens of memoars.
Since the early 20s, the scary novel of the poet with the green snake has been rapidly developed.
At the end of summer 1923, Esenin settled for a short time with a friend, imaginist Ivan Starzev.
It is surprising, but in his very good income, he never had his home in Moscow or Peter, he was located in flats, hotels or familiars.
The old men remember:
"I only came to sleep, and in most cases in a drunk, drunk.
Once again, at 4:00 a.m., Esenin fell down on the staircase...
When he fell, he scratched his face and screamed.
When he came in a little bit, he began coughing, and he scratched all the hollow blood..."
Yes, Isenin himself, after the European and U.S. voyage, (in the States there was a dry law, but Duncan had accepted a suitable drinking stock) admitted:
"I've seen nothing there but cabacs and streets...
I've ended up, and I've stopped remembering people...
Well, and a drink, of course...
And I've been drinking because the torment has been grieved."

MID Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as "weapons" against the EU
MID Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as "weapons"
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, Paul Jabloński, expressed the view that President of Belarus, Alexander Lukašenko, used refugees as “arms” against the European Union and intends to return to such an operation next year.
The relevant statement of the MID head was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Jabloński, the sanctions against Belarus have "stoped Lukašenko" temporaryly, but he "seeks new ways".
The Polish official is also sure that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons in many places of the world.
As the kp.ru website wrote earlier, the European Union has introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It touched 17 physical persons and 11 organizations.
In Europe, the readiness and further enlargement of restrictive measures against the Republic “if the situation in the country is not improved”.
Minsk responded to the food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to introduce sanctions against Belarus.

In the world events of 2021, the jackets were dominated.
Daniel Craig was probably the first to declare his new fashion decision.
In September, the film Prime Minister "No Time to Death" appeared in a barchat malina jacket and a traditional "bondow" butterfly.
The Earthshot Prize was followed twice by Prince William, who first took the eco-care ceremony of the Earthshot Prize, incompatible with the royal code, green jacket, and then chose a more classical option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A few weeks ago, the trend was based on himself and Lionel Messiah.
The football player came to pick up the seventh Goldball in the Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.

Not only online rhylers can be purchased.
Budget options are in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the segment, luxury jackets from the barchat in this season are represented practically in all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which one of the Prime Ministers of the House Gucci was the Ambassador of the Brand Jared Leto.
By choosing the jackets of expensive marks, you can be sure that the sheet is made of a sheet.
The special teeth-wrapping technology makes a dense tissue with a filthy external texture and a smooth internal side.
More budgetary options are made of cotton or polyamide, but they are also less.
The fashion expert of Lamoda Elia Vahoshkin warns that, in the case of a jacket, the main thing is not his model or fazon, but the appropriateness.
"Barhat requires a evening light, so this jacket is perfect if you are gathered for a party or a feast," explains Vahoshkin. - It will also be suitable if the invitation contains the Black Tie or Creative Black Tie.
Another important criterion that compliance allows to make choice in favour of a bargain jacket is his buyer's status.
"The man in a bargain jacket, first, should have a proper advanced party with a lot," believes the authors of the Telegram Canal on the Men's Fashion, "Beauty Brammmel." - The handlers of the jackets usually belong to the cost of those who are rarely buying tickets.
They are simply invited to attend special light events where the dress code is always specified.
Elia Vahoshkin suggests combining a jacket from a barchat with the same stuff: classic pants with arrows, one-tonne shirts, silk coats, fibers with purples, bands.
Too simple and daily things will seem inappropriate.
Fashion experts from Brammel's Beauty are sure that it will also be inappropriate to appear in the jacket of a soldier on the corporate, and that is, if it is a "management of those who run this event, "yes", it is the subject.
If the employee is lower and his goal is to move up in a complex hierarchy of the company or to blow financial bonuss, it is better not to wear a jacket.
The leadership will definitely appreciate the expression "not by the Shadow hat," according to the Telegram channel editors on male fashion.

It stresses that "military aggression" of Russia against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and cost expensively" to Moscow, but no specific measures are described in the document.
"We, Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the strengthening of Russia's military power and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," said the statement.
Furthermore, the ministers call on Russia to " weaken escalation, use diplomatic channels and respect its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities", as President of the United States Byden said during the video call to President RF Putin on 7 December.
" We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normand for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements in order to resolve the conflict in the east of Ukraine," also stated the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Great Seven.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response," they warned.
We reaffirm our firm commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome the restrainted position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement also states.
Earlier daily, the head of the British diplomacy, Elizabeth Trass, stated that Russia would be subjected to " serious consequences" in the event of invasion of Ukraine.
She said that the meeting showed the "one vote of the Great Seven countries" of 50 per cent of the global GDP, which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have great consequences for Russia.
The Pfizer vaccine was estimated 32 times less effective than the omicron-stamp
The efficacy of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the omicron cronavir stamp 32 times below compared to other types of disease.
This is the conclusion of scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong, according to South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity from citizens who received two doses of COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original option Sars-CoV-2, but that capacity was significantly reduced against omicron variety," said Professor Malik Peyris.
However, scientists emphasized that vaccine remains the most reliable way to protect from severe disease infected by coronavir.
The former scholars of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavir pandemic, taking into account its impact on the omicron stamp.
The research authors concluded that the omicron stamps could cause a new wave of viral circulation and increase mortality unless further measures were taken.
Ukraine's head accused the FRG of blocking NATO weapons delivery in Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of the former Chancellor of the FRG, Angela Merkel, of blocking the acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times, on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that Germany had put veto on procurement by Ukraine of anti-snape systems and guns to defeat drones last month.
It was noted that Berlin later mitigated his position with regard to guns, recognizing them as immortal weapons.
In approval of the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons under bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, it is United States, Britain, Lithuania and France.
In the meantime, FT notes that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Sholz on the authorization of weapons delivery to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier Sunday, Ukrainian Ambassador in Germany, Andrew Melnik, expressed his view that Kiev should not wait for weapons delivery from Berlin at Chancellor Sholtz.
He said that the previous leadership of the FRG explained its refusal to provide arms with the risk of the development of a military escalation of the conflict in Donbass despite the " occupation of Russia" of the Ukrainian territory.
The same " illogical " position, the diplomat ' s sureness that Germany will remain in the new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenski stated that Kiev was expecting assistance from Berlin to equip the marine fleet.
In Ukraine, Germany was expected to " be a technical partner of Ukraine," added the President.
It was also noted that, on the spring of the year, the Co-Chair of the Green Party, Robert Habek visited the Republic for sale of Kiev defence weapons.

Foreign Ministers of G7 warned about " serious consequences" for Russia if it continued military aggression against Ukraine, indicated in the outcome statement of the parties.
The meetings also noted that they condemned the strengthening of Russian armed ones at the borders of the country.
" Russia should not be doubted that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs," said the statement published on the British Government's website.
The Ministers of G7 and the Supreme Representative of the EU noted that “they are the only ones in condemnation of Russian armed strengthening and aggressive rhetoric to Ukraine”.
The head of MID of Great Britain, Elizabeth Trass, at the press conference in Liverpool, warned about “great consequences” for Russia in the event of invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any intrusion would have significant consequences...
G7 wishes Russia to renounce the aggression of Ukraine," she said (TASS quotation).
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of G7 agreed earlier at the Liverpool Summit that the Russian troops in the border with Ukraine had to return to the negotiation table.
It was negotiations in Normand's format.
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke for the dialogue on Ukraine in the Normand format.
The representative of the MID of Russia, Maria Zaharov, stated that, calling upon Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiations table, G7 countries had "subscribed to be incapable of taking responsibility for their own errors".

Exposed methods of return of stolen money stores
There are several ways to return the money stolen through the Internet stores and not to be a victim of fraud in the future.
They were disclosed by information security experts in the interview with the RBC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when the banking map is arrived in the hands of criminals, it is recommended that basic funds be stored on a map or a bank account that is not used for online shopping.
Part of the accumulation can be postponed on the savings account and as necessary.
Experts also recommend a separate map for shopping in the network.
If the money was stolen in shopping stores that did not use 3D Secure protection technology, the reimbursement procedure could be launched.
"In the framework of the rules established by the payment systems, on non-authorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility of the participant in the calculation chain, which does not use this service," acknowledged the representative of the Promscusbank.
The expert from the international payment provider, Ecommpay Arthur Zarba, stressed that the buyer had the right to file a statement to the bank to dispute a fraud transaction no later than 120 days after buying.
Furthermore, if the criminal used a map on online resources without a two-factor authorization, the transaction could be opposed and returned.
It is noted that, in some cases, the Internet stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been delivered.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the League of Safe Internet, Ecatherine Mizulina reported that 11,000 cases of fraud were received only in 2021: from selling fake documents to theft of personal data.
It said that an effective solution under current circumstances could be the establishment of a single window for complaints on online fraud.
Sholz arrived in Poland to discuss the North Stream-2 and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Sholz, arrived in Warsaw for negotiations with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the strengthening of Russian troops at Ukraine's borders and the situation with the Russian gas circuit, North Stream-2.
While Sholz claimed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed the unequivocal expectations of each other.
Poland Prime Minister Mateus Moravec said that he would invite Sholz to speak against the North Stream-2, by which the Russian gas was intended to be delivered to Germany in the circulation of Ukraine.
In the view of Moravech, Russia could use the gas-train against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported the efforts of Poland to stop the flow of migrants trying to reach the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that Warsaw and Brussels would be helpful to resolve the crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court has punished Poland, determining that judicial reforms carried out by the right party " Justice and Justice " have violated the EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay fines, and its higher court decided that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new Government of Germany, which has made an oath on Wednesday, despite the requirements of Poland and the United States, did not take public commitments to stop the work of the North Stream-2 in the event of Russia's invasion into Ukraine.
American officials stated to the members of the Congress that they had reached understanding with Germany on the stop of the gas pipeline, if Russia invades Ukraine, reported on Tuesday a high-level staff member of the United States Congress.
The German officials did not confirm these reports, but Sholz warned on the consequences on Wednesday if Russia violated Ukraine's border, and that position were confirmed by the representatives of the Great Seven on Sunday.

Our money in the church wall will pay $20,000.
The Santechnik, who found the money in the church wall in the American state of Texas, will pay the reward.
This is reported in the press release of the non-commercial Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in the great Gospel Church of Lakewood, where the pastor Joel Austin preached that the religious Christians are gaining fortune and prosperity.
In November 2021, a warehouse of Justin Cowley repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of money and checks under the heat.
He handed over the church’s findings, and he said he did not even receive thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do," he quotes KPRC-TV.
Apparently, the findings were related to the robbery that happened in the Lakewood Church seven years ago.
At that time, about $200,000 were missing in cash and $400,000 in the form of checks stored in the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church had no loss.
Nevertheless, a $25,000 prize was announced for information on criminals.
Justin Cowley was unable to claim that amount, as the award is already expired.
Nevertheless, the non-commercial organization of Crime Stoppers of Houston, which in time paid $5,000 for the prize and later received $20,000 for a gift from the Church of Lakewood, decided to reward the clergy of the Santechnical.
He'll get $20,000.
Previously reported that the police interrogated Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the church wall.

Full protection scheme from COVID-19
Virusologist, doctor of medical science, earned Russian science worker, Anatoli Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, has established a full protection scheme against coronavir infection.
He said that this could be achieved by injection and use of a nazal vaccine.

Immunoglobulin A protects a slippery shell, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And in the inside of the vaccine, we have the most immunoglobulins of G (antitel).
And if you enter both vaccines, you will get a lot of A and G immunoglobulins, but there's not yet a double vaccine solution," said the medicinal person.

He chose my society and went home.
In a video that works 90% of cases.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I have hampered many of the masters not to run after the dog, even though they read that there are 200 thousand running away, I took my hand and took it to the other side.
In the end, "200 grand" chose a master, not a dog who ran out there.

WHO found the micron in six dozens of States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new micron crown crown was already identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts already said that the spread of the new species could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of dissemination was reported in the WHO report.
According to the organization on 9 December, the stamp was already identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
It was that it had only started to spread actively from the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern at the high rate of the spread of the new version of the coronavir.
WHO experts are concerned that the new preliminary stamp could go through the distribution of Delta species, but it was an Indian version of the coronavir, which is now leading in all countries without exception.
Before that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Gabrielus, stated that the omicron stamps were capable of significantly affecting the pandemic of coronavir.
Similar conclusions were made in Britain.
The experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "micron" will exhauste "delta" in the coming months.
And only the number of patients in Britain will be approximately 1 million, with the official "microne" in the Kingdom in this moment, several hundred people are sick and up to 10,000 are estimated.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the micron pharmaceutical artist, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to the hospital at the top.
The British health system will not be able to deal with.
The situation is complicated that, according to recent studies, the efficiency of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the micron type 32 times below compared to other types of disease.
The reaction to the "micron" of the Russian Satellite V until unknown, will be clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalei Centre has only been tested by the Russian vaccine on the micron.

The United States (9 per cent) and Brazil (8 per cent).
The users for iOS as they used to spend more than the Android users: 65% of all the costs in the apps had to be spent.
Among the annexes was the first place in the number of downloads for 2021, the CapCut video editor.
It follows two Indian applications: MX Taka Taka video services and an application for meesho online trade.
The top-10 loads are also included in Telegram.
In general, the number of downloads is popular for users of VPN-services (top-10-two-VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and video-related services (including CapCut and MX Taka Taka, two other such services - My and SnackVideo).
“The users spent more than anything in direct broadcasting and online intervention applications”, notes the report.
It leads to YouTube, the top-5 user costs include the TikTok video service, the Striming Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as the Japanese Piccoma subscription service.

Worldwide, people adapted to pandemia through the transition to life in Mobile, which is one of the main conclusions.
The highest success has been achieved by those industries that have helped people to be closer both virtually and personally," commented the report by the manager of the Marketing Studies Department of App Annie Lexi Sidou.
The mobile games sector delivered in 2021 reached $90 billion, and the leaders on the number of downloads were casual and hyper-specific games in which there was almost no or nearly no story, and the videos were minimal.
The top-3 most popular games in the world included Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, DOP 2: Remove One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY are led in the middle of the games.
Previously, App Annie presented her projection for 2022.
Among the main trends of the next year, the company analysts referred to the increase in the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the increase in popularity of Z-generation financial applications, such as the Robinhood investors, and further increase in the popularity of metaversive mobile games.

Russians warned about the new scheme of frauds
Victims began searching for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
It is written " Notifications " with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon Zaura Abutaliva, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communications are the dipfeas.
In this case, a fixed video is created on the basis of real recordings with the victim's involvement.
This results in a precise reproduction of the characteristics of the behavior of a person.
Abutalim added that by using the dipfake, criminals could call a familiar video-link victim or create a film with a copy of a human dispatch to blackmail.
" Such counterfeits can easily provoke a bulling, as a perpetrator can put people into silly, dangerous or compromising pseudo scenarios," said the expert.
The leader of the system engineer Varonis Alexander Wetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people are more trusting others when they see them.
He emphasized that this could create specific risks in case of video technology.

Dr. Paulova told me about the "migraine of the weekend" of the worker's workers
Several factors may result in a deterioration of self-sensitivity during the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of self-efficience after working days is often " migraine on the weekend", said a known doctor endocrinologist, a medical candidate, a senior scientist at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine, the Scientific Director of the System Medical Clinic, Zuhra Pavel, in his telegram channel.
She said that workholks with headache, fracture, and weakness are particularly often suffering from this.
Dr. Paulova noted that, in addition to a week of tiredness, there were sufficient objective reasons for the negative response of the body to change conditions.
Weekly, our lives are rooted.
"Sleep long, all day lying on the couch, probably eating more, and drinking less," said the doctor.
Because of the dishes and the lack of water, it is gravity and fracture."
Further role plays a late rise.
So if you get up for three hours later, the reaction that is called Jetlag will occur.
It arises from passengers who cross several clock zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a crucial role in deteriorating self - efficiency, Paul recommended that the most important thing be changed on the weekend.

South Africa scientists stated that the Pfizer vaccine was lowly efficiency against " microne "
In South Africa, the Pfizer vaccine was lowly efficiency against " microne "
Scientists of the South African Republic conducted a study and reported the low efficiency of Pfizer vaccine against the omicron stamp of coronavir infection.
It is estimated that the (microne neutralization level) corresponds to the (level) efficacy of the vaccine at 22.5 per cent against symptom infection, which is due to the doubt of the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection," says the study published on MedRxiv portal.
Professionals, however, argued that the product could be saved from severe illness.
Previously at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the omicron stamps of the coronavir could cause a new pandemic wave in Britain with more frequent hospitalization than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars in usual products?
Sugar is not the best source of useful foodstuffs.
His excess in the diet may lead to diabetes of the second type, as well as to heart and oncological diseases.
The users should be taken into account that under an unknown word in the product can be indicated hidden sugar, sugar, similar to calority, composition and glycaemic index.
The label may be presented by several dozens of names, in fact of sugar marking.
One of the most common and frequent names is glucose and fruit.
Other sugars such as dexstrosis (corn sugar), leulosis (fructuary sugar), melass (black patch), agawa syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbons that refer to mono- and disharides, and they may not only be in conditer products but also in ketchup, doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce the consumption of sugar is to use targeted and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and many different sugar names.
Various types of sugar differ from taste, but whatever the product ingredient is called syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, it still remains sugar.
The exact amount of sugar is not easy to calculate, as not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package but also that vegetables, fruits, etc. contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be much higher than the label.
German Chancellor Sholz: gas will lose importance for the FRG in 25 years
The new Chancellor of FRG, Olaf Sholz, stated that the import of gas was deprived of the importance for Germany, since the country continued to move to dearbonization of the economy.
He said that by 2045, Germany plans to fully renounce gas, oil and carbon, and become a climate neutral country.
"In 25 years, the world will play another role in transporting gas to the FGG and Europe," Chancellor said.
Shaltz noted that Germany continued to remain committed to transporting the Russian natural gas and in the future, as this resource is of importance to energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which support was found by Berlin of the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Previously, the head of the MID of Germany, Annalen Berbok, stated that the process of certification of the North Stream - 2 was continuing.
According to the Minister, coalition negotiations and discussions of the coalition treaty were stated that energy projects should apply European Energy Law.
The diploma also indicated that the pipeline has not yet been in conformity with the requirements of the European Union.

In the New Caledonia referendum, most voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, concluded with the same result as the two previous.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, on noon, most of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted during the referendum against independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote has become significantly lower than in two previous votes.
According to the preliminary results published by local authorities, “for” the independence of New Caledonia from France was 3.51 per cent (2,755 per cent) voted, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against.
The Java was 43.90 per cent, and more than 80,000 people in New Caledonia participated in the elections.
As the French-Presse ' s interim outcomes commented, " the outcome of these elections did not leave a place for doubt", since the independence party called the voters not to participate in the vote.
As referendum initiators, they opposed its conduct on 12 December, considering that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelague prevents the full and " fair" pre-electoral campaign.
Thus, this failure opened the way to the third victory of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the inhabitants voted against independence, in 2020 to 53.3 per cent.
According to separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will dispute them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, 12 December, in the Elisha Palace, President of France, Emmanuel Macron, should be presented as a result of this referendum.
The theme of independence of New Caledonia has in many ways renewed the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several candidates for the presidents expressed the benefit of remaining in France, since it was the " latest region of the presence of the European Union in the Pacific".
“New Caledonia must remain French”, repeatedly Eric Zemmoor.
The same statement was made by the candidate from the Republicans, Valerie Pecres, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, calling on the Columbians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position, "because it was not his responsibility".
However, the President added, "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, on his own, expressed "the strong desire that the choosing of the Columbians would be the choice of France."
Lights, oh, hello!
I'm a little... I've got a lot of screwed up, still embarrassing, ashamed.

WSJ readers criticised the article on the relations of Russia and the United States
The Wall Street Journal criticized the article of Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations with Russia and the United States.

At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "go on a single front against Russia".
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American Professor.
"In this article, a lot of false information," the RIA News gives a commentary of one of the readers.

So they are able to act against air facilities, against other drones.
Even against the pilot aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and other Turkish aircraft: corpus and so on,” quotes the Dialogue.ua.
In commenting on the main features of ANKA machines, Arestovic said that it was a reactive, not a poor BPLA.
He said that this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceeds its "with all characteristics".
The first BPLA party should be produced by a factory at the end of the next year, concluded the Arestovic.
The ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of a drone was held by Turkey's authorities in collaboration with a number of private companies since 2010.
Before the Ukrainian General Headquarters secreted the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile facilities during the joint force operations in Donbass.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelenski reported that the construction of a contemporary military drone factory in the country was initiated.
He said that Ukraine intends to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and Ukrainian mino defenses concluded an agreement on the construction of the Centre in Kiev, in which staff training will be conducted, as well as the testing and service of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum a "great real step forward".
Two lions fled from the container at the airport
In the Singapore airport, the lions fled.
The Straits Times reported that.
Two predators were able to get out of the container with a family of lions arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the lions fled on the roof of the container.
The beasts couldn't get away from it because of the closed protective network.
The opposition ended after the arrival of staff in Mandai Wildlife Group, known by all Singapore zoo.
They circled the lions with the restrainted droaters and planned to deliver them to the quarantine.
It was previously reported that in Pnompen, the capital of Cambodia, the lion fled from the landlord and walked across the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast came home voluntarily, and people were not hurt.
Specialists warned about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies indicate that the excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, may lead to cancer.
The Daily Express issue was warned about this.
Professionals believe that there are significant evidence that people who do not experience a lack of folic acid are less risked to disease with certain types of cancer, in particular colorful.
However, overdose of the necessary dose has contributed to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietologist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the number of foil acids consumed during the day.
The optimum dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer is increased only if the number is significantly deviated to a large or smaller side.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without the doctor's recommendation, to monitor the dosing and avoid milk peaches and other foodstuffs containing folio acid.
Previously, Rachel Fain, nutrition advisor, called a foil acid, which slows ageing.
Since, among other things, it was in avocado, Fine recommended that men have more fruit after 50 years.
In Britain, by April, about 75,000 people may die because of the omicron stamp.
British scientists forecast that the proliferation of the omicron cronavir carnavir in the next five months in England may cause up to 75,000 people to die if they do not intensify restrictive winter measures.
The The Guardian newspaper reported this with reference to the research of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS transmitted.
According to the most optimistic prognosis of professionals comprising a scientific and advisory group on emergency situations in the British Ministry's office, by April 2022, at least 25,000 flight outcomes will be established in the country because of the omicrone stamp and a total of 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of disease, hospitals will take more than 2,000 infected daily.
" Serious measures to combat coronavirus may be required to prevent the overload of the National Health Service if the Omicron stamps are more infectious than the option of delta and the active vaccines cannot exclude the infection," said mathematician Rosana Barnard of LSHTM.
Previously, the British Health Agency has informed: if the proliferation of the omicron stamp remains at the current level, by the end of the year, there will be approximately 1 million infections in the country.
By mid-December, the omicron can become a dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, in Britain, 1898 cases of omicron-stamp of coronavir were discovered, of which 633 were identified during the last days.
The head of Britain's Britain's Minhala, Sadjid Javid, said that this rate could already reach 10,000 cases in reality.

The demand for superheats has grown for a quarter in the world
Building superheats this year and orders for the next year will be hit by all records in the world despite calls for reducing carbon lead and combating climate change.
In the world registry, the number of ordered yachts was 1200, a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the impacts of climate change for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a swimming fortress of $50 million and above will not be reduced, says Gardian.
However, they are increasingly growing.
This year, 25 per cent of ships were ordered more than in the previous year.
Brokers say that the market was not 20 years old.
The first reason is that many who can afford a boat fear of land infections and prefer to hide from the pandemic on their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavir.
If all these people went to the office before and met with business partners personally, the absolute majority of them are now working remotely, and the negotiations are being negotiated.
Broker Will Christi told the newspaper that the portfolios are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that the contractors are willing to pay more, only if their yacht was prepared for at least a year or two earlier.
"The people just want freedom, and the super rich could afford it," he said.
In the western society, many criticize such behaviour and call it a Decadent.
Wealthy sociologists do not want to understand that when traveling to space, living on yachts or flights on their own planes, it is a social irritation because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with all the rest of mankind.
Economists call on Governments to act and suggest to introduce new taxes and rules for super rich people, even though they understand that, with such money mobility, it would be extremely difficult.
In the meantime, only the number of ordered super-eats is impressed, but also their characteristics.
Of 1200 ships, 27 is the length of the feed above 100 meters.
The Norwegian billionaire of Recca is building the boat of REV Ocean 183 meters long.
It'll be the biggest yacht in the world.
The yacht provides a moon pool, as well as a submarine for sea depths.
The existing super-eats were common for the helicopters, the cinemas under the open sky, and some of them, such as the MacGregor Boy Platform for University.The Professor for Economic antropology of the University of America in Indiana Richard Wilk said that compared to the total number of greenhouse gases, carbon trail produced by super-rich, is small.
But it is symbolic if it takes into account that more than 2,000 billion people in the world.
It's just another example of superusing a very few people.
Scientists discovered that the emission trail of billions was thousands of times more than a medium statistical inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces a average of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, the largest pollutant of the planet is Roman Abramovic responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that had fallen into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trails were on its yacht, Eclipse, at a length of 162,5 meters.
Even if the owner is out of the boat, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner may call the captain and give the team a ship, for example, from the Mediterranean sea to Caribbean.
The superheat owners do not cause compassion for other people when they, like the richest woman in Australia, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that their giant ships have no place for the harbor.
It is also difficult to understand its invitation to build marines for ships 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of the infant cancer
American scientists have identified the risk of cancer development a week.
This is the issue of Daily Express.
Professionals concluded that the use of four and more alcoholic drinks per week had an increased risk of oncology development.
This increases the probability of illness by increasing the number of alcoholic consumption.
Furthermore, the risk of the cancer of the intestinal cancer of the females is modestly drunk.
The exact reason for this kind of oncology cannot be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors lead to a destructive process.

Dogs can understand the words and phrases at a two-year child level
Many, but more specifically, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very clever.
But they don't even know how developed four-foots are.
For many years, biologians have performed various experiments to know, of course, how intelligence of animals will develop.
Although the dog’s vocabulary stock is not as extensive as human, a new study proves that the dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or compile poems, do not make sense in politics, economy and art, while they often fake their owners.
The representatives of some species, considered experts, show better results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet sufficient.
Thus, some species are traditionally considered dog genius, for example labradors.
Scientists found that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and they do not fall away from a two - year - old child.

United States and Russia have been prepared in Ukraine for trade
The United States and Russia will “trade” on the entry of Ukraine into NATO, said Alexander Kochetkov, analyst in his article for the publication of Glavred.
In his view, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations on the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not enter the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Byden on the right of countries to " enter anywhere".
If you are offered something inadmissible, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not trade, but simply send the suggestor.
The analyst wrote that trade is intended for Ukraine.
Cochetkov added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine, but to Dialogue with Kiev.
" Preparation shall be conducted secretly, quickly and immediately, rather than waiting for the grouping to be detected and deployed by the opposition forces," he noted.
China stimulates the development of rail transport sector
Fine Chinese technology drew attention to companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the International Railway Transport Exhibition and Equipment Manufacturing of 2021, which was held in the city of Jujou of the province Junan /Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnostic technical failures, noted the representative of Hou Čauven.
High-speed trains courseing by the railway line of China Laos, which was introduced in operation at the beginning of this month, have already been equipped with data technologies, which will ensure the increased reliability and mobility.
In the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles and many Asian and European countries have become witnesses of Chinese speed.
In May this year, the CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd was deployed by the first two-way railways developed in China for export to Europe.
With the maximum working speed of 200 miles per hour, these trains will go on railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
The metro train, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began to be tested in November.
The train will be moving through the metropolitan, which connects the centre of Istanbul to the airport of the city.
The metro will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with 120 miles per hour.
"The Chinese railway equipment industry is one of the highest innovation sectors and the strongest international innovative competitiveness," said Fen Jaosian, head of the Chinese Trade and Investment Department of the Committee for the Promotion of International Trade /CCDMT.
"This sector is the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-class equipment production in the world market," said Fen Jaosian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, conducting a number of independent research and developments, China has created a good railway equipment system, full subsidiary and large-scale production system.
According to Fen Jaosian, the country takes the first place on the level of electricity of railways and on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist listed early signs of demention
The biological science candidate, Semen Golonejkin, in the interview with the Sputnik radio, listed the early signs of demention.
He said that the signs of future demention could be forgotten, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as the inability to concentrate, plan, the reduction of abstract thinking.
The debate is currently discussed that the loss of hearing may be both the early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and one of the factors in the risk of its emergence, said the expert.
Golonejkin emphasized that the causes of demention may be neurogenerate disorders, head traumas, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and aterosclerosis of brain vessels are the most common causes of the syndrome.
The biologist noted that medicalists do not know the effective methods of treatment of demention.
It is therefore necessary to begin its prevention in time.
He said that reducing the risk of demention development would help learning foreign languages and active communication.
WHO also recommends that the moderate level of physical load be maintained, regularly trained cognitive skills through games and hobbys that require intensifying memory and thought logic
"There are recommendations on the application of various BADAs, but their efficiency and appropriateness are still discussed in the scientific community," said Golonejkin.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regular training of cognitive skills and skills through games and hobbys that require intense memory and logic of thinking,” said Golowaykin.
Previously, the charitable organization for demention study in Great Britain stated that the disease is increasingly impressed by people aged 40 years.
Medicines called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered to be the problem of vision, which causes the patient to acquire difficulties in recognition of objects.
Another sign of developing weaknesses, the experts called the aphasy - the condition where a person cannot find the right words to transmit what he wanted to say.
Neurologist needed to send Saacashvili to abroad treatment
Former President of Georgia, Michael Saacashvili needs psychological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said to journalists, Otar Toidi, who belongs to the doctors established at the Ombudsman of Georgia.
His [Sakashvili] neurological status is leading to his disease.
The stable challenges are the movement, coordination, nature change," said the expert, noting that this is not beyond the regulatory framework and that the ex-President is now necessary to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"It is called neuroreabilitation and mental rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia," said Toidi, demanding that Saacashvili be treated in a special institution which is not in Georgia.
At the evening of 7 December, Saacashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical assistance after his penalty officers were punished.
The Georgian politics quickly revoked the punishment and renewed itself in the former rights.

In the Spanish towns of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against the mandatory vaccine certificate from COVID-19, Europe Press transmitted.
In the Catalan capital, the number of shareholders was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, the COVID passports were compulsory to go to bars, restaurants, sports rooms, homes of older people and night entertainment.
Many manifests have come to an action without masks.
They accused the State of totalitary and called upon respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also need more than 50 people to enter entertaining facilities and restaurants.
The opposition in this city claimed medical dictatorship, and the vaccine was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million of coronavir infections have been detected since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to introduce restrictions for non-vaccinated persons.
The draft legislation on a single QR code system introduced the Government to the State on 12 November.
The Russians are expected to be able to visit the sites of mass activities, cultural institutions, public food objects and discharge trade with either a certificate of vaccination or transmitting disease or vaccine.
The same rules will be set for trains and planes.

Cool rise: how the Chinese become miners
Olympiada should attract millions of people to the slope and help to establish international courts in the country
China hopes that the Olympiada will not only attract 300 million people to winter sports classes, which will enable the President Si Zingpine to gather 1 trillons of Yuana, but also facilitate economic development of remote provinces.
The Taiwa Mountain in Chanzjako, located near the place of the winter Olympic Games, is increasingly popular in the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, work on greening: workers are planted by trees.
There are more than 700 mountains in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
There are problems with snow in many regions in China, where the residents, including in Zhanzjako, are located.
The main challenge for the long-term prospect is to ensure a comfortable and interesting rest in the Chinese courts so that all the new ones will become forever.
However, it is far before.
The Adviser for Games Justin Downs said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed until unrecognized.
In winters, more and more Chinese are being sent to the slopes each year.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many years to create a mining culture here, believes Downs.
Many places are in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions are still to develop and create the infrastructure needed for rest.
The 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunli, near the places of the winter Olympic Games.
He notes that there has been a winter sports tourism bum in recent years.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chunley, the rapid railway was conducted, and none of the local people suffered without work.
In the country, more and more shops trade in clothes and winter sports equipment are opened.
The slope opens the spots with national kitchen dishes.
There is even a COVID-19 test station on Tajva.
China strives to create a prosperous winter sport industry, its sportsmen should become leaders of the biggest international competitions, and courts and equipment to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world can face extreme poverty due to pandemia, said WHO
More than 500 million people in the world could be placed in extreme poverty due to the pandemic of the coronavir, which hampered the progress of mankind in the overall access to health services, said in the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the International Day of General Health Services of WHO and WB, two complementary reports were published on 12 December.
They stated that the pandemic had led to disturbance in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the population's immunization has declined, the mortality of tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and BB emphasized that the pandemic has caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has been harder to pay people for treatment”.
This situation pushes over 500 million people "to extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services from their pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish stated that the pandemic of the coronavir had caused more than 100 million people to fall into poverty, more than four billion people have almost no social support.

Reuters: Taiwan Minister has been disfellowshiped from the Summit for Democracy on request of the White House
The Taiwan Digital Technology Minister, Audrey Tan, at the panel discussion during the United States organized Sammit for Democracy, was transferred to a video regime, a recording of the Summit on YouTube.
The Reuters Agency claims that the picture was disabled on the request of the White House.
They reported that the map of Taiwan was a separate color from the PRC that considered the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was made by the South African NGO and ranked the countries of the world to ensure civil rights.
Taiwan was designed as "free" on it, and the CNR, NDR, Laos and Vietnam were red as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, the picture on its side was replaced by a box with the note that the views of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the Government of the United States."
The PRC was not invited to the Sammit for Democracy.
The sources of Reuters pointed out that the map shown by the Taiwan Minister could go in contrast with the "one China" policy that was followed by Washington.
One of the sources of the agency stated that, after the map, the United States National Security Council had angered its contact with the State Department, accusing him of showing Taiwan a separate country.
The Summit for Democracy, organized by Washington, took place from 9 to 10 December, with representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the Zero Day Summit, the Nobel Prize Laureat, the Chief New Journal Editor, Dmitrij Muratov, called for an international fund, through which the money gained through corruption was given to charity.
Rather today, the Deputy Secretary of Saubeda, Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit had been carried by the " Antirosian and anti-Kinean charges " .

It's probably just in education like that...

What if this concerns other areas of life, judicial proceedings, etc.?
The laws are not written for them.
What if Dad's still initiating his methodology of education and education?
Feeling some kind of example for others is very bad.

In the MID, " sad conclusions " in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Heads of Russia, Sergei Rajabkov, evaluated the prospects of the relationship of Moscow and Washington.
He noted that a long way of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not started yesterday.
One side negative predictability exists, but part of a prospect of improvement in relations is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion of the long way we've gone with both the current administration, Tramp and Obama.
Problems have not been started yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Rajabkov, the problem is in the utility of the United States to incorporate Russia's approaches to a number of issues.
The MID heads added that it would not risk giving optimistic forecasts on the prospects for improvement of relations and would not expect to change the position of Washington.
He explained that, except for directions such as strategic stability and cyber security, progress was not observed.
Russia, however, calls on the United States to a responsible approach in international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the reasons of sound sense.
Previously, Head of MID of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, at the meeting with the Secretary-General of America, Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to restore the dialogue with the United States.
Virusologist warned about the risk of vaccination by COVID outside hospitals
The nazal vaccine from COVID-19 may be allergic and need medical assistance, so the first paragraphs for this medicinal product should not be organized in airports and trade centres.
The TACS virusologist, a member of RAN, a laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virusology of the Novosibir State University, Sergej Netesov.
To organize vaccination points with a vaccine at airports and trading centres is easier, but I would only do it at first times in medical institutions.
The fact is that the probability of allergic response to such vaccine is small, but it is desirable that a person then sit next to the doctor's office.
The doctors have special sets of anti-allergic medicinal products that operate literally in a minute or two, which sometimes is very necessary," said Netesov.
A virusologist believes that the vaccination in trade centres can be considered when experience in the use of the medicinal product is accumulated.
He also emphasized that when using the nazal vaccine, it is important that it reaches a slippery shell in the nose sheet.
However, the vaccine is likely not to reach the destination if the vaccine that is tagged in the nose is exhausted after the wax.

Sky News informs that.
In particular, 1196 new micron charms have been detected in England, 38 people have a new variety of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.

Sandkov warned of the suffering of Western countries involving anti-Russian sanctions
The Press Secretary of the President of RF Dmitri Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continuing " aggressive action " against Ukraine, including due to the alleged " invasion " in the country.
"Some restrictions to introduce against Russia and not to suffer itself are impossible," said the official representative of Kremlj in the television channel "Russia 1".
Peskov claims that it's "Everyone in the world."
It was previously reported that the United States considered the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the field of energy as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions to complicate the conversion of rubles into dollars against the Russian banks and the Russian Fund for Direct Investments.
The head of the Sberbank, Herman Graff, is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonia people rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final outcome of the third referendum on New Caledonia's independence, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave France.
The French BFM.TV television channel reported on this on 12 December.
96.5% voted against independence.
Independence of France was maintained by 3.51 per cent of the archipelagos in the South of the Pacific.
The results were cancelled by 2.99 per cent of the bulletins.
The voting level was very low on that day: about 55 per cent of the archipelagos had reached the stations.
Experts believe that the low phenomenon is due to the calls of separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to pass the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the people of New Caledonia in the referendum expressed against independence against France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the finding of archipelagos in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 miles from France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its property.
There are about 270 thousand people living in the archipelague, and the territory is given a special administrative and territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonia Administration provides that the region can vote on its independence twice in two years.

WHO has previously considered "micron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminarily believes that the micron is less dangerous than the delta stamps of the coronavir.
However, there are data on reducing the efficiency of vaccines in the disease of the new COVID-19 option.
The micron was registered in 63 countries on 9 December.
Preliminary data and significantly modified antigenic profile of the micron protein are allowed to assume that the vaccine efficacy against infection and the transfer of the option is reduced.
According to the preliminary conclusions from South Africa, it may be less difficult than in the " delte "," said the WHO technical report.
The Organization notes that all registered infections of " microne" in the EU are still prolonged easily or without symptoms.
However, the new stamp, according to the preliminary data, is distributed faster than Delta.
Two cases of omicron-stamp infections are registered in Russia.
They were "immunised earlier", reported the Gamalei Centre.
The head of Rossenger Ana Popov stated that there were no reliable data yet that the new version of the coronavir was less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios were named for Greenland
The Expert Deputy of the High Council, Vadim Denisenko, listed four development options for the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Greenski, in 2022.
He believed that the head of the State could be without the support of the West, and perhaps compromise on Donbass.
On Sunday, 12 December, Denissenko told in a publication on the Glovred portal.
The first option that Denissenko called " perfect storm " suggested that Ukraine would stop supporting key Western countries by reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such development will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev could face in 2023.
"It is a parallel to reduce the prices of key goods that we traditionally export " ...> internal protests and the opposition of power with key PGGs (Financial and Industrial Groups. - Red.) ", added the ex-parlamentary.
According to Denissenko, there is another scenario of development -- war against everyone.
This projection will be fulfilled in case of high turbulence in the world policy where Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this situation, Ukraine's leadership could compromise Donbass, which resulted in the opposition of the country.
At the end of the summer, the probability of this situation, according to the former Nardep, is to 50 to 55 per cent.
The third option of the development of the situation in Ukrainian policy is the opposite of non-Green Groups of the Populist and the President, which is likely to control the force block and implement Populist initiatives.
In the course of this crisis, Greenski will begin " transformation of power", added Denissenko.
Another scenario is the transformation of Greensky into "the father of the nation".
This may lead to an event that will be a great shock for society.
"The event must be sufficient to raise the response of external partners and to increase Ukraine's support," Denisenko said.
Such a situation is possible by natural disaster, technology disaster or Russian aggressive action, the ex-member believes.
However, the Russian party has rejected the probability of " attacks" on Ukraine several times.
Moscow noted that Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States have increased military activities at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, the surveys of the Rating Social Group showed that the Ukrainian President's rating was declined to recordly low, with 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest indicator since the election of his head of the State.
The analysts predicted a situation where, in the nearest elections of the President of Ukraine for Green, only 21.8 per cent would give their vote, while the former President of Petra Poрошenko was 14.5 per cent.
At the same time, only 19.3 per cent were expressed to the President among all requested.

Arrested for action at the Red Square poet: "For the quotation of Eutušenko 10 days, there it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, a 21-year-old poet, Alexander Volchenkov, was arrested for ten days.
The WSCE student was detained at the Red Square with a poster on which hestage #poetross was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Eugeneu Eutušenko.
Alexandr had a protocol on the administrative article on the re-violence of the order of public action.
The first time he was detained on 23 January at the Pushkin Square, on a meeting in support of Alexei Naval.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry generally, and now its interest was, unfortunately, lost to the decline of the common culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We have contacted a young poet to find out the circumstances of detention and to disclose the message.
How did police officers treat you this time before?
What did the department ask how your share was commented?
This time, the staff were more correct, the maximum detention, the kind, as funny as it sounded in some context of the word.

Researchers showed how potatoes help to combat age violations
The study showed that potatoes are rich with vitamins and microelectrics that contribute to improving the blood and reducing cholesterol levels.

These are carbon products that are rapidly diluted into sugars such as sugar, sweet alcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the Commersante newspaper warned about the possible lack of Russian potatoes, noting the reduction of their production in personal subsidiary holdings and the increase of processing powers.
According to market participants, the product deficit could only replace imports.

Estonian scientists will look for life in Vienna
The Massachusett Technology Institute, in collaboration with the Tartus Observatory and other research institutions and companies, prepares three space missions to Venus to find signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday "Aktual Chamber " .
The aim of the missions starting five years later is to assess the life of the clouds of Venus and then find life there.
For the project, Tartus scientists offered tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
The clouds of Venus near the Earth were still expected to be too acid to live there, but probably originally Venus was a planet of type of earth.
During the third mission, a sample should be arrived from Venus.
Let's assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it looks like a earthly or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that the earth’s life has not started on Earth.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life has been born on Earth," said the head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project, Mikkel Pauzalo.

The business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own meta-inhabitants and their subsequent monetization.

The British economist could not provide a projection for 2022
The British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to provide a projection for 2022, since he believed that such attempts would be a failure.
He wrote this in the article for the Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictableness and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the pandemic of the coronavir, and secondly, inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also confessed that he did not know whether the prices were temporary or not.
According to the expert, before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of infinite generosity of central banks has already survived itself” and it is time to return to relations where the percentage rates of inflation will be correlated with the expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that the continuation of over-measure economic policy in pandemic could, in some experts, lead to a new inflation.
Furthermore, O'Neill summarized the issue of productivity growth, as well as increased poverty and climate change.
Previously, the Head of the Division of Global Research " Opening of Investment " Mikhail Shulgin said that positive expectations for the dollar for 2022 were maintained, while the growth capacity would be less significant.
In addition to the risks for the course of the dollar, Shulgin referred to the FRS currency policy, the dynamic of oil prices and the fear of the pandemic of coronavir.

After 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent 2 trillions of 784 billion rubles to buy new cars, which was 28 per cent higher than the same period last year, the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency's statistics (NAPI).
To understand the scale, approximately the same amount (about 3 trins of rubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and economies during the pandemic of the coronavir.
Last September, at the meeting of the Heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount was compared to more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
Income on the Russian market, the Korean mark Kia leads.

However, the sales of Korean brands did not increase significantly: according to the statistics of the European Business Association of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia had achieved more than 9.4 per cent of cars in the same period as before.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota, in cash-expression, wasted by the Russians for 10 months of 275.5 billion rubles, 14 per cent more than a year earlier.
The Japanese follow Mercedes-Benz with 266.1 billion rubles (+75 per cent) - the German premium brand increased and sales (by 37 per cent), and the average car price (on 28 per cent, to 8.2 million rubles).
" Mercedes-Benz also observes a good increase in sales and average price -- more, for example, than BMW -- from here and more financial efficiency -- - explained the NAPI Director Tatian Arabiaji. -
In the growth of sales, the fantastic indicators show Chinese brands, which also significantly increased financial efficiency this year."
The Russian Lada on income growth shows medium-night rates (+ 28 per cent), the Russians spent 229,4 billion rubles on the cars of that mark.

They regularly transmit prices to their production and other autoproducers.
The volumes of the Russian road market in cash will continue to increase, besides the deficit of the vehicles, inflation and the pursuit of autoconcerns to play past losses, experts believe.
In the terms of the car deficit, I think many car concerts have even been able to partly transfer to the consumer the cost of the past periods that they could not put in the price of cars before,
"Analyst WTB Capital on the Vladimir Bespalov autoproof."
I believe that the autoproducers now feel very well in financial terms, maintaining high sales marginality."
The indirect indicator of this is the rate of the increase in the cost of vehicles observed during 2021, the prices for new vehicles are increasing faster inflation, according to experts.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in money, but mainly through inflation and complicating the construction of machines itself, Bespal projected.
The proposal will be limited with the rise of opportunities to raise prices.
In the cash expression, the Russian author will continue to grow and in the future year, even if the cost of cars slow down, autoproducers will be able to obtain their income from volumes, notes the independent Sergei Burgasliev autoproof advisor.
In view of the increased demand and the insufficient proposal, the autoproducers are now seeking to obtain the biggest profit from each car sold, Burgaslies notes.
The increase in the production of machines is not expected for the next six months, while the insufficientness of citizens in the future is also heated in Russia.
In the background of the situation on the market, the cars were a good object for investments purchased a year ago, even with a run, now can be sold more expensively, as observed by the expert.
Baiden expressed the transfer of US military to Ukraine in the event of the invasion of Russia
The U.S. leadership has never considered the sending of US military to Ukraine in the event of the invasion of Russia.
This statement was made by the President of the United States, Joe Byden.

Byden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and Natov troops to the eastern flag, B9 of all the NATO countries with a holy commitment to protect them from any attack by Russia," said Byden.
Press Secretary of Russia, Dmitri Peskov, emphasized that Moscow had no intentions of invasion into Ukraine.
He pointed out that Moscow saw the problem in the fighting of Turkey's drones, and that " American weapons are approaching our territory".
