The members of the Welsh Meeting are concerned that they will “seem like Mupets ”
Some members of the Welsh Meeting are consterned by the proposal that their title should be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal is the plans for changing the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the meetings across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could make a laugh.
One member on the Labourist side said that his group fears that “this is rhyme with Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers outside Wales: In england twp means stupid and pwp means bullshit.
The Plejd member said that the group as a whole "is not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said that his group approached the change of the name “with open mind” but noted that the MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the english letter “w” is spoken like the letter “u” in yorkshire English.
The Commission’s meeting, which is now preparing the legislation for the introduction of a change in the name, stated: “The final decision on how members of the Welsh Meeting will, of course, be called on the members themselves.”
The law of the WELGE Government of 2017 has given the power to change its name to the Welsh Meeting.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals, where broad support was obtained by the option to call the Welsh Parliament's meetings.
With regard to the title of the meeting members, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support in the public discussion.
The members of the meetings clearly suggest alternative options, but the fight to achieve consensus may bring to the concern of President Elin Jones, who is to submit a proposal for legislation within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include further changes in the functioning of the meeting, including the rules for disqualification of members and the draft committee system.
Members of the meetings will vote on their title in the context of the negotiation of the new legislation.
Macedonians will vote on the change of country's name
On Sunday, the voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed into “Republic of North Macedonia”.
All votes should address the tens of the last years of dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
The Athens have long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour represents the right to the Greek territory and repeatedly protest the requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the plebiscity of the change of name, declared that the vote would not be followed.
The referendum representatives, including the President of the Government of Zorana Zaeva, however argue that the change in the name is simply a price for EU and NATO entry.
The calls at St. Martin will be silent because the churches in Harlem fight for survival.
"Old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no one there today."
The extinction of bars is understood.
"The people are dealing in a different way today," he says.
"The bars are no longer the living room of the quarter where people go regularly."
Regarding churches, he is concerned that money from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later will be exactly where they began. ”
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of such types of people who will not help the remaining Stations in the quarter.
"A total majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and that is why the day that these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become members of churches."
Both churches have built white congregations before it became black metropolitan – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original white methodistic congregation moved in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the Black Congregation, whose godlyness was held nearby.
St. Martin took over the Montenegro Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was headed by the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping bullwar in Harlem, who refused to employ or expanse black people.
The fire in 1939 had severely damaged the building, but when the father Johnson's pharmacists planned his rebuilding, they also ordered a bell.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called the bell of the poor.
The expert who played the bell in July called it "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell in the church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one's been replaced by St. Martin.
In the last few months, a complicated story of architects and builders, some of whom were called by the lyic officials of the church, others episkopal dieces.
The Council of Elders – the Governing Authority of Pharity, consisting of laic representatives – sent a letter in July, in which he expressed concern that the diecesion “will seek to cover costs” to the elders' Council, although the employment of architects and builders sent to dieceze did not take part.
Some fountains complained about the insufficient transparency of the diet.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old boy in California who drowned for lobsters
According to the official report, a shark attacked on Saturday and injured a 13-year-old boy who drowned for lobsters on the day of the beginning of the humility season.
The attack took place in the morning shortly 7 o'clock ago near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Dieg that on Saturday morning he drowned with his friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he wandered to him with the whole group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel stated that the call first considered the joy of a lobster catch, but then “he realized that he was screaming“ He bit me!
He bit me!'
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that “he had the entire area of the key bones broken apart. ”
"I shouted to go all out of the water: 'The shark is in the water!' Hammel adds.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Council's Children's Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles said at the press conference that the shark was seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was designed not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic wounds in the top of the body.
The Office for Investigation and Security closed 48 hours of access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad after Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter a cosmetic market in Great Britain
Sainsbury's wants to build the boots chains, Superdrug and Debenhams cosmetic streets in the style of a business house where specialised salesmen will be available.
In the framework of the strong marketing of cosmetic in Great Britain, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and domestic needs falls, the streets with cosmetic will be tested in 11 sales throughout the country. In case of success, the next year will be expanded to other sales.
Investment in cosmetic is connected with the attempt of supermarkets to find use for regals used earlier for television, microwave pipes and domestic needs.
Sainsbury's states that it doubles the size of the offer of cosmetic products to 3,000 products and introduces marks like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
More space will also receive an existing range from L'Oreal, Mordalline and Burt's Bees marking places like those in boots.
Supermarket also reinserts its sorting of make-up Boutique, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
Furthermore, in two Saintsbury sales’s sales's concessions will be tested by a small-marketing seller of fragrance Shop. The first such store was opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the next year will be created in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping online and moving towards daily shopping of small quantities of food in local shops means that supermarkets must try more to attract people.
The Director-General of Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says the sales will look more like business houses, because the chain of supermarkets is trying to make a better offer of services and non-food products to fight discounted sellers, such as Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened hundreds of selling branches of Argos and also introduced a series of Habitat departments, which are the chains he bought two years ago.
The previous attempt to reconstruct the supermarket department with a cosmetic and pharmaceutical classification ended unfamiliarly.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury's tested the joint company with Boots, but the connection ended after the arguing on the distribution of medicinal products in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s 3 years ago sold his 281 pharmacists for 125 million pounds to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain.
Lloyds is to play his role by adding a expanded classification of luxury marks for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four sales.
Business Director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the appearance and style of streets with cosmetic to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our sorting of marks should satisfy all the needs and the attractive environment and the advantageous positions mean that we now represent a attractive place for shopping cosmetics that changes old shopping methods."
Peter Jones is "anger" after Holly Willoughby dropped off the contract for 11 million pounds.
The star of the Dragons Day Peter Jones "smalls" after Holly Willoughby's television moderator departed from a contract worth 11 million dollars with his lifestyle mark so that she can focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothing and the Truly's accessories.
The incentive of this couple was compared to the Goop actress Guineth Paltrow.
Seventy-year-old moderator announced the departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last moment – to focus on her new large contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the informed sources, Jones “smashed” when a TV star at a busy Tuesday meeting at the centre of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of the new contracts, up to 1.5 million pounds, would no longer be able to devote time to their marks of domestic clothing and suitableness of Truly.
The surveillance was compared to the Goop actress Guineth Paltrow and could double the wealth of Moderator Willoughby in the estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When 17 - year - old Willoughby announced to Instagram that Truly was leaving the mark, Jones left Britain to one of his summer neighborhoods.
The unnamed source states: “The Truly mark was the entire priority for Holly.
It was her long-term future, which would provide her for a few decades ahead.
Her decision to leave was totally shocked.
No one could believe what's going on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
There's a full storage of goods ready to sell in the Marlow center."
Experts believe that the departure of the moderator show This Morning, which belongs to the most favourable British stars, could cost the company millions in view of the fat investment in products from pillows and candles after clothing and home clothing and possible further delay in the label.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been a close friend for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby set up the Truly mark with Tary Capp in 2016 and the 20-year-old Jones joined as Chairperson of the Bureau in March.
Pairs ride together on vacation and Jones has 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become an Ambassador of M&S and replace Anta McPartlina in the modification of the I'm A Celebrety to ITV.
The source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business. ”
The difficult acts “and then we fell in love ”
He was joking about the criticism that he would receive from journalists as a note that some believe as “unsuitable president ” and how positive he talks about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump replied by his ridiculous "proclaimer" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after their June first meeting in Singapore Trump appreciated as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons were stuck at the dead point.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, the important North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations Valn Meeting that North Korea from the United States does not see “suitable response” to its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, the United States continues to sanctions with the aim of increasing pressure.
Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were at the edge of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, he believed, resulted in positive results — the closure of missile tests, the help to release hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers to the country.
And he stopped his unusual approach to information about relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave as President, but instead of trying to get 10,000 out there to get into this scratched arena, we should have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said and pointed on the crowd ahead.
Tsunami waves and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, in the situation after the earthquake of Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations have learned that they are not necessary.
Although more than 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lombok were expelled from their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is an essential assumption to accelerate international assistance.
"In many cases, they were very clear that they did not require international assistance, so it is a little difficult," Mrs. Sumbung said.
Although the Children's organization is bringing together a team that travels to Palo, it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel can work here.
The speaker of the National Disaster Agency, Mr. Sutupo, said that the Indonesian officials evaluate the situation in Paul to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Since the earthquake occurs very often in Indonesia, the country is still unprepared to anger of Mother Nature.
Although the Aceh ceilings against tsunami were built, it is not common on other parts of the coast.
The loss of human lives has likely contributed to the obvious lack of siren warning in Paul against tsunami, even though the warning was issued.
Even in the best time, travel among many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship that coated in Lomboc and helped victims of earthquake is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days to get to the place of the new calamity.
Improving the bad Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of the election campaign of President Joko Widodoa and the president spent a lot of money for roads and railways.
Next year, he will seek to be elected again, but his government will collapse the funding deficiencies.
President Joko also faces pressure from the persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia when members of the Muslim majority accept a more conservative form of faith.
The street fights between Christians and Muslims, where gangs use machetes, ports and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already demanded more than a thousand people and tens of thousands of people have expelled from their homes.

Cromwell's statue in parliament has recently been hit by arguing about "prescribement of history"
His exile would be a punishment for his fanatical puritanian followers in the style of Taliban destroyed many English cultural and religious artifacts.
But Mr. Cromwell Society called Mr. Cromwell's proposal "idioticity" and "the effort to overwrite history."
The President of Cromwell Society John Goldsmith says: “In the existing debate on the elimination of the statues, it was unavoidable that one of the goals would become the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell hasn't ordered or conducted an iconoclass in English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his precedent Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent formation of Cromwell, whose author is Sir Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the view of the 19th century and part of the history of the figure that many think they still deserve to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Mnight people consider Cromwell, even though today is something less than at the end of the 19th century, for the defense of Parliament against external pressure, of course by the monarchy.
The precision of this interpretation is the subject of uncomfortable historical debate.
Certainly, the conflict in the mid-17th century formed the follow-up development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifier figure that represents one side of this area.
His success in the Lord's Protector's function is also worth celebration and remindance."
Killing pigs broke the Chinese farmer
According to local media, the market in southeastern China was attacked and killed by pig farmers.
As South China Morning Post wrote on Sunday, a man with only a name “Yuan” was found dead with a cross-cut arterial in the blood cloth near the market in Liou-pchan-shui province of Kuj-Chu.
The pig farmer is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs on 30 May 2005 in the city of Si-ning in China province Ching-chai.
He reportedly arrived in Wednesday with his cousin from the side province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the next barrel was open.
He said there was a big powder in the powder with blood thumbs.
According to information, forensic research confirmed that 250 kilogram pig broke the farmers.
"The Brother had the legs of all bloody and crushed," quoted Guiyang Evening News' cousin, named "Wu".
On the security camera record, Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News journal that the pig was closed so that no one else would think when the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
The market representatives are allegedly dealing with Yuan's family on compensation for his death.
The attacks of pigs on people are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at the farm in Massachusetts and cruelly injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300kg pig pulled the welsh farmer to the tractor, and he was removed by the farmer’s wife.
After the oregonic farmer ate his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoby said the CBC News station that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a “starter”.
"They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa will bring strong rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurican Rosa is weakened by predictions and moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the next days, it will bring flood rain to northern Mexico and southwest of the United States.
At 5:00 a.m., Rosa reached the wind speed of 137 km/h, which represents a category 1 hurricane and was 620 km south-east of Punta Eugenia city in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific, the beard of low pressure is formed and moves to the east of the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California semi-east on Monday, it will be like a tropical storm and start pushing tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up 250 mm collisions on Monday.
The tropical moisture then, with the nearing scar of low pressure in the next days, causes strong rain in the southwest of the United States.
The cruises of 25 to 100 mm locally cause dangerous floods, streams of sufficiency and possible soils in the desert.
The strong tropical moisture will cause the sites to be close to 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas in the southwest of the United States, especially above the majority of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm crashes are expected.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions, the distracted nature of tropical rain may occur inflammatory floods.
Given the danger of tropical crashes, it would be very unreasonable to walk to the desert.
A strong rain can cause the canyons to become the rainfalling rivers, and the storms bring locally blowing winds and flying dust.
The nearer beard of low pressure will bring strong local crashes on certain parts of the coast of South California.
There may be a total collapse over 13 mm, which could cause smaller streams of suffix and slippers.
It will be the first rainfall in this region.
On Sunday evening and Monday morning, the only tropical strokes will be approached to Arizona and on Monday evening and Tuesday the rain will be expanded.
On Tuesday, a strong rain will spread to four corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense changes in temperatures throughout the United States, because the Arctida is starting to cold, but in the tropical zone it will still be warm.
It sometimes leads to a strong temperature change in short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaho in Nebraska and the difference between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsia.
In the next few today, they will try to expand summer heat again.
Most territories in the middle and east of the United States are expected a warm beginning of October with temperatures around 27 °C from the south planes across the northeast of the United States.
In New York City, there could be 27 °C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast shows the high probability of high temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation followed over 20 million people
More than 20 million people were watching on six TV channels a quarterly linked statements from the candidate at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual attack, which reportedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political pat situation continued, and the voters interrupted the regular programmes with reports on sudden Friday Return: the agreement that Senator for Arizona Jeff Flake had intermediated, that the FBI would conduct a weekly investigation of the charge.
Christine Ford told the court committee of the Senate that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was touching her at a high school party drunk and trying to get her dressed.
In his excited deposition, Kavanaugh said he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were watched by the Nelsen Agency.
The company was counting on average monitoring on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for other stations that have transmitted statements such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not available immediately.
And Nelsen usually has trouble counting people who look at the offices.
For comparison, it is similar to the number of watchers who watch football games in play-off or participating Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderaters strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the greatest trace from all stations when he was monitored by the Nelsen Agency during the whole day hearing in the average of 5,69 million viewers.
The second was the ABC station with 3.26 million audiences.
Nelsen states that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.2 million viewers.
He remained interested even after the negotiation was completed.
The main figure of the Friday drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of this modest republican made a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS camera caught on Friday morning, as protestants cried on him when he was about to ride a lift to the court committee.
CNN lived on the way he stood with a few minutes with his eyes, and he had to go.
One woman said: “I stand right in front of you. ”
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement, and before closing the door of the elevator, he added that he would say more about the committee's negotiations.
All cables and television networks later broadcasted lively when the court committee was to vote for the submission of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do that if the charge against the candidate would be investigated by the FBI next week, which required a minority of democrats.
Flake partially convinced the conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After the interview with Coons and several other Senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched a FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.

Before the anniversary of the independence vote, the police faced catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting for independence encountered with a regular police and thousands of people joined in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of voting on independence divided by Catalan.
The regular police blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder color after them. The streets that are usually flooded by tourists created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, there were also conflicts that the police had to use their arms to calm down.
Groups supporting independence were singing "We will not forget, we will not forgive" faces in the face of protesting Union counterparts who cried "Let Spain live".

A year after a referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal but separatist catalans celebrate it, remains tension in the region that strives for independence is still high.
The voters of the large majority expressed themselves for independence, but the participation in the elections was low because the opponents of the deviation were boicing them.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people have been injured last year after the police in violent conflicts across the region have tried to end the vote in the election rooms.
Groups supporting independence remained on Friday night outside to prevent demonstration to support the national police.
Although the demonstration went through, she had to choose another route.
The 80-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated with his wife in a separatist protest, said he no longer hoped in the prospects of acquiring independence for Catalan.

My parents cried with joy to vote, but now we are in a blind street," he said.
Despite the important, despite the close victory in the regional elections last December, the catalan parties supporting independence have to fight to keep things in progress this year. Many of their most famous leaders either left to exile or are waiting in custody for their share in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Twenty-five-year-old Monter Joan Puig recorded a protest to support the police on his phone and said that the conflict was sighing by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalan leaders waiting in prison last year, announced on Saturday that the next year will run to the European Parliament.
"The candidate in the European elections is the best way to judge the decline in democratic values and repressions that we are witnessed by the Spanish government," he said.

Mengo's hit secured Livingstone victory 1-0 over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Mengy for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who came from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of 18 matches as the manager of the Ibrox club.
The Dolly Mengy Trefa turned out to be crucial when Gary Holt's team came to Hibernian in the second place.
Gerrard's team has not yet got this season in Premiership victory on the field of guests and next Sunday will be the first Hearts to lose eight points.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has expanded a number of fights without defeat in the division to six fights, so the main coach Holt, who ran Kenny Miller last month, has not tasted the defeat.
Livingston did not use a chance against unexplicit guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before the goal because his directness caused Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson broke into the defense, but he failed before the gate, then Alan Lithgow just passed the head of Craig Halkett in front of the gate.
The households were just watching Rangers play before them because they knew guests could suffer from standard situations.
And so the key naked came.
Against the Rangers was ordered a free cop, and Livingston created a sculin, Declan Gallagher and Robinson sent Mengu, who was scoring and scoring the ball in the middle of the penal territory.
In this stage, the Rangers dominated in holding the ball, but the domestic defense was invisible for them, and Liam Kelly brancor had mostly no work to do.
The same picture of the game was in the second half time, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to hit.
Scott Pittman stopped Rangers Allan McGregor's legs and Lithgow didn't hit another standard situation in Livingstone.
In the Livingstone penalty territory, the centres that were continually cleaning, and two penalt spears came to the ground — after Halkett's attack on the substitute Glenn Middleton, and another in hand.
‘Fenomen’ from Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont with BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and still overcome expectations on their way up.
Their style of games and men have almost changed since they returned to the peak, but the Holt deserves great commendation for how the team had erupted since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was awesome, leading greatly arranged defense, while Menga kept him all the time in the emergency for Connor Goldson and Joe Worral.
Rangers are missing inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't reach these standards anymore.
Their end was chab – only once they broke into the homeside – and for Rangers it should be a wake, because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan waited for a mixed arrival in the Cole.
On Saturday (September 29th) when leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and all the smile.
This is the last day of a controversial visit to President Erdogan in Germany, aimed at fixing relations between NATO allies.
They disagree with a number of themes, including human rights, freedom of press and the adoption of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Colin, where he opened a huge new mess.
There is a largest Turkish population outside Turkey in this city.
For security reasons, the police have prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the meshito, but there have been many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
There were also hundreds of people -- many of them were Kurds – protesters against Erdogan, who condemned his policy and decisions of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the controversiality of a visitor, which some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as a autocrate.

Hurikan Rosa threatens floods of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where it is dry can benefit)
It is not usual that the tropical beards of low pressure affect Arizona, but it is probably the beginning of the next week when the remaining energy of the hurricane Rosa crosses the desert southwest and brings the risk of the floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings against floods on Monday and Tuesday from the West Arizona for South and East Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel through Phoenix on Tuesday and brings rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “from 1950, only ten tropical cyclones were stored up to 320 km from Phoenix’s state of tropical storm or pressure below!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane of 64 km from the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Centre for hurricanes foresee crashes from 50 to 100 mm, in the area of Mogollon Rome in Arizona, up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the eastern northwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Panve, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local edges to 100 mm.
For those who are not in danger of the floods, Rosa's rain may be a blessing because the area has been dry.
The floods are a very serious thing, but these crashes may help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States has just hit dry.
The weather.com server states that U.S. Drought Monitor experiences more than 40% of Arizony at least "extreme dry", which is the second highest category.
The road to the hurricane Rosa will first lead to Baja California's polo islands in Mexico.
Rosa, still with the strength of the hurricane with the maximum wind speed 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at 19 km/h north.
Then the storm will meet the colder waters of the Pacific, and therefore it will lose its strength.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, collapses will be strong, which represents a great risk of flood.
“In the area from Baja California to Northwest Sonor, a total collapse of 75 to 150 mm is expected, with up to 250 mm,” states the weather.com server.
Rosa then likes as a tropical storm across Mexico north and on Tuesday in the morning arrived on the border of Arizona, then passing through Arizona and on Tuesday late night entering South Utah.
“The main risk of Rosa or her remains is expected to be very strongly disturbed in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the Southwestern Southwest of the United States," the National Centre for Urricanes informs.
These rains are expected to cause deathly dangerous floods and streams of fertilizers in deserts and landscapes in the upper area.

Trump says that Kavanaugh "cus the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is the rejection of the unreasonable and scandal tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the property in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh during his nomination process “cus the wickedness and anger” of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh told before the Congress on Thursday, where he definitely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's order that several decades ago, when teenagers were, he sexually attacked her.
Ford also told her about her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that day “the American witnesses were the greatness and quality and courage. ”
His representatives from West Virginia said that “a voice confirming judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the most excellent legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has an excellent public service account. ”
The President indirectly insisted on Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it is that the Republicans take part in the elections in the middle of the functioning period.
“Five weeks ago, one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm still moving," he said.
"So I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump declared that the Democrats decided for “resistance and obstructions”.
The Governing Board of the Republican Party said to the CNN station that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the ground of the Senate is expected at the latest Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims continue to grow
On Saturday, the authorities announced that after the Indian island of Sulawesi affected the large earthquakes and tsunamis, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of which destroyed huge waves flooded by the beaches.
On the beach in Palo, on Friday, hundreds of people gathered at the festival, but at the darkest of the coast, up to six-foot waves that killed many people and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The wave of tsunamis was preventing the earthquake of the power of 7,5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people continued on beach activities and did not immediately escape, so they fell with waves for the victim," said the speaker of the Indonesian Agency for Mitigation of BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroa on the Brifin in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave didn't go alone, took cars, cloths, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugro said and added that before the coast attack, the tsunami waves spread at the open sea at 800 km/h.
He stated that some people fled the trees and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palo.
Aviation photographs, which were published by the Disaster Reduction Agency, show many destroyed buildings and shops, screwed and broken bridges and a meshite surrounded by water.
The consequences were shaken by the coastal city even on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were to feel in a area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Appliance Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy was released by the Friday's strong trespass was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bombs deployed during the second world war in Hiroshim.
The city is lying at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could even increase the tsunami wave.
Nugrohu described the damage as “extensive ” and said there were thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found scattered under the ruins of declined buildings, and he added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroh informed that the number of victims and damages could be greater on the coast of 300 km north of Palo, in the area called Donggala, near the epicentre of earthquakes.
He said that the communication was “freely protected without any information” from Donggala.
The Red Cross stated in his statement that more than 300 000 people live in the area, and added that his workers and volunteers are headed to the affected places.
"It's a tragedy, but it could make it worse," the statement says.
On Saturday, the agency experienced considerable criticism because she did not inform Palu that the wave of tsunami was affected, even though the authorities stated that the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
At the amateur recordings shared in social media, it is hearing a man in the higher floor of the building with desperate screaming warning people on the street against the nearing tsunami.
During a few minutes of coast, the water wall will hit the buildings and cars.
Reuters wasn't able to verify the record immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunami waves caused a huge loss of electricity that interrupted communications in the area of Palo, so the authorities could only have been difficult to coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army began sending trucks with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only for the transport of aid and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centres in Palo on Saturday.
The number of Tsunami victims in Indonesia climbed to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When the workers of the World Vision of Donggala arrived in the city of Paula, where employees hide in the ceilings built at the courtyard of the office building, they saw images of destruction, says Mr. Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed homes,” he added.
It's too bad.
When assisting groups started a sad work to help in disasters, some of them complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to the Indonesian legislation, financing, supplies and personnel from abroad may begin to be placed on the ground of calamity until the zone of national disaster is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," says speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross Aulia Ariani.
"When the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can start international assistance, but it is not yet."
When the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami came in Paul, friends and relatives of those who were still unwilling, they still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that distract the dark stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a little boy out of the channel on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescue officers released a woman who was held in jail for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists on the Asian games that ended in Indonesia this month.
Another of the people in Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a man who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon emphasized how in the hours followed after the paragliding community learned about the denial of Roa Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages through whatsApp competing from Palo, who attended the beach festival.
But his messages, instead of a couple of blue scratches, ended with a gray mark.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he says.
The thieves took 26 750 USD during completion of the Newport bankomate on the Levee
According to the press report of the Newport Police Department, the thieves left on Friday morning 26,750 USD worker Brink while complementing the bankomate in Newport on the Levee.

Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name – to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: “The creature is formally known as Kanye West. ”
Forty-five-year-old West has a name Ye for a while and uses the pseudonim as the name of his eighth album, which came out in June.
Change comes before his show in the Saturday Night Live show, where he should introduce his new album Yandhi.
In the show, the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for “sensitive reasons ” as he stated the creator of the show.
West has already said that the word for him is other than the abbreviation of the existing professional name and the religious meaning.
The “ye” is the most utilized word in the Bible, where it means “you”, was told by West at the beginning of this year when he spoke about his album with the Big Boy Radio Moderator.
"So I am you, I am us, it's us.
It's changed from Kanya, which means the only one, to just Ye – just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of whom we are."
The name has also changed a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names of Love (Love) and Brother Love.
The former West collaborator, J.Y., also wrote his name with the connector and without it and with large and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised that he would not use the army against civilians.
At the occasion of the 50th anniversary of blood attack against students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador committed himself to never use the military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on Tlatelolco Plaza that “he would never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
At the time the left student movement spread across Latin America, the soldiers started shooting people at a peaceful demonstration in the Square and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador was committed to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to students and opening other free public universities.
He declared that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education brings young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert on the artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the United States should double the amount they invest in research in this area.
The comment comes after the various parts of the U.S. government have published an AI notification, even though the United States has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China has launched a plan by which it wishes to be an innovative AI by 2030.
"Duplicate budget for research of AI would be a good beginning, since all other countries are far further than the USA and we are looking for another breakdown in AI," Lee says.
Lee, in the interview for the CNBC this week, said that doubled funding could double the chance that the next major discovery in the AI area will be done in the United States.
Lee, who issued this month in Houghton Mifflin Harcourt his book “Supervelmocy AI: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order”, is the Director-General of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most significant AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 80s University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on the AI system that overcome the best American player in the Otello game, and later he was head of the research worker Microsoft and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee appreciated the previous technological competition of the U.S. government, such as the Robotic challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when it would be next to help identify new visioners.
Researchers in the United States often need to try hard to obtain government grants.
"Academic peaks do not take China but corporations," Lee says.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have been employing the best experts in universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
In order to improve efforts in the area of AI, the United States believes that change in immigration policy could also help.
"I think the doctorat holders of the AI business should be automatically offered with green cards," he says.
The State Council of China issued the Plan for the development of the artificial intelligence of a new generation in July 2017.
China's National Fund of Natural Sciences provides funding for people in academic institutions like the National Scientific Council and other government organizations give money to researchers in the United States, but quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
The United States Department of Defence has established the Joint Intelligence Centre, which is to be involved in partners from the sector and the academic environment, and the White House has announced the creation of the Election Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that she invested 2 billion USD in an AI Next initiative.
With regard to NSF data, it now invests more than 100 million USD per year in research.
However, the U.S. legislation that wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not done anything for a number of months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum whether they want to change the country's name
Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum whether the name of the country should change to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would solve a decades old dispute with Greece, which blocks the requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour represents the right to its territory and therefore vetted Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments concluded a new name proposed in June, but nationalist opponents suggest that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovak population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov declared that he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycot calling campaign raised doubts whether at least 50 per cent of the voters would be delivered to the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum was, "Are you for NATO and the EU membership with the adoption of a Greek agreement?"
The appreciators of the change in the name, including the President of the Government of Zorana Zaeva, argue that it is a price worth paying to make Macedonia, a member of the former Yugoslavia countries.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they could live freely under the roof of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not mandatory, the number of members of the Parliament said that they would be followed by the result of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-third majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no problems have been reported in 13 hours.
However, the vote was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters finally repayed their vote.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko are giving their votes in the Macedonian referendum on the change of the name that would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage to the parliament and drawing the chairs before the states built by people who are boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with a head raised, not a door for servants," Kavadarkov says.
“We are the poor land, but we have our pride.
If they don't want us like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Assian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has a level of unemployment exceeding 20%, so needed investment.
"I think the majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
The result “yes ” would be“ confirmation of our future. ”
According to a survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, the referendum could participate between 30 and 43 percent of the voters – which is less than the required participation.
In another survey arranged by the Macedonian TV station Telma, it was found that 57 percent of respondents would vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote yes.
In order to be successful, the referendum must be updated by 50% plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious injury for the Western government policy since it was launched last May.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City came for a goal through the entire defense of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made the defense of Brighton on Saturday, and thus secured Manchester City win 2-0 on the Etihad stadium in Manchester.
In Aguer's administration, his naked in 65th minute seemed ridiculous.
It all started with the retrieval that the Argentine attacker got in the middle of the field.
He printed between the three brayton defenders and got into the open space.
Then Aguer was surrounded by four green dresses.
On the edge of the conviction territory of Brighton, he circled around one defender and ran a few more.
He found Sterling on the left.
The English attacker attached the ball back to Aguer, who right-handed the Brancher of Brighton Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has a problem with his legs," reporter City Pep Guardiola announced.
“We thought he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's what it was.
We were lucky he put a naked at that time."
Initial advantage for Sky Blues in this game Premier League has arranged Sterling.
This goal fell in 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
On the left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a remote stick.
The Sky Blues attacker put the ball into the network just before he slipped out of the field.
City will play Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the League of Masters at Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the joy of Rockies
When the Nationals were expelled from the play-off fight, there was no many reasons to enter again.
But an eternal competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be set up for a castle in a fight against Colorado Rockies – only when they will have Rockies who run in NL West on one game over Los Angeles Dodgers, hope for play-off.
Rockies made at least a wild card on Friday night victory 5-2 over Nationals, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
"If we don't play anything, we can at least start, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play about the greatest effort I'm going to do this year.
Why don't I want to play?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are allegedly struggling to throw Scherzer for such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be 34th start.
The right-handed DC has 18-7 statistics in this season with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump attended a meeting in Western Virginia
The President indirectly expressed the situation around his candidate at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about how important it is that the Republicans take part in the elections in the middle of the functioning period.
"In November, everything we have done will be in the bet.
One of the most important choices of our lives remain five weeks.
It's one of the great, big -- I'm not running, but we're still moving and I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: “You see that horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it happens right now.
And they're determined to take power through any necessary means, you see the wickedness, the immorality.
They don't care who they're hurting, whom they have to overcome in order to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give it to them."
Democrats, according to him, decided for “resistance and obstructions. ”
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, and said that the Democrats were "angered and wicked and disgusting and lied."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Court Commission, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud bullet in the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what?
No, no, wait -- that was really the bad speech of the body -- the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The Labourist Party is no longer a variety of views.
He is not tolerant to those who express their views
When activists from the Moment on my local side voted for my comment, it wasn't a surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of labourists who said they weren't welcome - because they honestly said their opinion.
My colleague from parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she was resistantly confronted with anti-semitism.
In my case, I was criticised in a note that I disagreed with Jeremy Corby.
In view of the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxically similar issues that Jeremi did not agree with previous leaders.
The notification of the Friday meeting of the Labourist Party at Nottingham East stated that “we want the meetings to be accessible and productive. ”
Most of the eight years since I was a local member of the Parliament for the labour party, GC meetings were exactly like that on Friday night.
Unfortunately, in this day, most meetings do not take place, and the promise of “greater, more politics” has been forgotten for a long time, if it has ever even started with it.
It becomes increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the labourist side and every opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This started shortly after the leadership of Jeremy. The colleagues I thought before we had similar political views, suddenly expected me to turn around 180 degrees, and I would stand positions with which I couldn't agree – whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in the public - and it doesn't matter what I say - then the tirada of the social networks where they call for my appeal, they condemn the middle policy and tell me that I should not be on the labourist side.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments on me are usually political.
I have respect for professionality and determination of those colleagues who face every day the inflammation of sexist or racist insults, but they will never step down.
One of the aspects of this era of politics from which I am most disappointed is how insults become a standard.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labourist Party should grow a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer limited with this variety of views and with each proposal to express confidence or change in the selection rules, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I have been encouraged to stay back, not to speak so much, and then “I will be fine. ”
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I had entered the Labourist Party as a school student 32 years ago, the lack of care was caused by the government Margaret Thatcher, who let my class of universal school break down literally, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most — whether as a local council or minister of the government.
I've never hid my policy, even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the existing leadership.
For those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only say that when the country is exploring to Brexite, which will damage households, businesses and our public services, I do not want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labourist Party.
Of course, my main message is not designed to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labourist Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of appeal or political pragmatism will prevent me from acting according to what I think is the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, undefeated, rising to the top
Two late fives slightly scratched the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved in this incredibly fun match Tennent's Premiership triumph.
Now they're headed by the tables, like the only invincible.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and better use of chances that helped the home to win, and the coach Peter Murchie had the right to be satisfied.
"We have been through great tests in our fights, and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, says: “All the honour of Ayra, they took a better chance than we did. ”
Five Grant Anderson in 14 minutes, transformed by Frazier Climate, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for the Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to use the number of advantages, and Jason Baggot won an unchanged five.
Climo increased the leadership of Ayra with penalta and then scored exactly in half-time and changed the salt attempt, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayra.
But Melrose started the second half well and the five of Patrick Anderson, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on his noses, and when he started playing again, Ayr again jumped through the five of Stafford McDowall, which Climo transformed.
The representative captain Ayra Blair Macferson then received the yellow card and Melrose again used the players with the unchanged five Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
The households came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow for the attack of Clim without ball, MacPherson put the ball behind the progressive maule of Ayra.
Climo changed, again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth five homes.

"The sea is ours," inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Navy guards in front of the La Paz marine command, which is decorated by chains.
Over the public buildings, the blue flag is flagged in the ocean color.
The marine bases from Lake Titicaca for Amazonka are described by the password: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to gain it."
In the entire Bolivia, there is still a living memory of the coast that the country lost in the benefit of Chile in a bloody war on sources in the 19th century – as the desire to reimburse the Pacific.
These desires may be the biggest in a few decades, because Bolivia is waiting for an international court decision that should fall on October 1, after five years of roaming.
"Bolivia has energy, the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, expects a positive result," says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will monitor the MSD decisions on large screens around the country with hope that the Hague Tribunal will decide for the benefit of the Bolivian claim that – after many decades of interrupted talks – Chile is obliged to deal with Bolivia's sovereign approach to the sea.
The Charismatic Native President of Bolivia Evo Morales, who has a controversial battle for the re-electing next year, also has a great interest in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court decides for the benefit of Bolivia – and even if it did, it would not change much.
This United Nations body has no power to give to a Chilean territory by the Netherlands and has stated that it will not determine the result of possible interviews.
The fact that the decision of the MSD comes only six months after the last arguments were raised shows that the case was “not complex”, as says Paz Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years, they didn't just support Bolivia's thing, but maybe it's rather hardened.
"The issues of access to the sea have been raised by the existing Bolivian government," Zarat says.
It adds that Morales' attack rhetoric weakened all the remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will begin to act again once again, but after this will be extremely difficult to discuss.
Both countries have not changed Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Deputy Bolivia in Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia “a special opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to“ end 139 years of disagreement with mutual advantages,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales -- still one of the most favorite presidents in Latin America -- would use the question of the sea as a political chicken.
"The pain will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is not going to happen unless the United States can believe.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his people will never arm their nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN Valn Meeting.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises made at the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after it appears that the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is about to restart the nuclear diplomacy that has stuck at a dead point for more than three months for the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Unem.
Ri says it's a "playing hope", that the lasting sanctions and opposition to the United States against the declaration that ends the Korean war could sometimes be slaughtered by the North on the knees.
Washington is cautious about the consent of the declaration if Pchjongjang first does not make significant steps to disarmament.
Kim and President of the United States Donald Trump want the second summit.
Of course, there is general scepticism that Pchjongjang thinks seriously that he will renounce this arsenal, which the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pchjongjang next month to prepare for the second summit Kim-Trump.
The Paris show shows that your fashion shops will soon arrive in the latest trend of huge head covers.
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely block the sun, your search is over.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of huge head covers for their spring/summer 2019 collections on the show that on the Paris week of fashion all grabbed.
Very unpractical hats this summer flooded Instagram and these designers sent their exciting creatives to the mole.
The exhibition piece of Valentin was overwhelmed bedge hat with a wide edge of a feather that flooded the heads of the models.
Other excessively large supplements were decorated melons, a wizard hat, and even ananas – but are not intended to warm the head.
Thom Browne also represented the choice of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the pestro-color masks have sewed lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One craft reminded the diving equipment and with the snorch and glasses, while the other looked like a corn with a ice cream.
And if you continue with a huge fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion scholars predict that huge hats could even reach fashion shops.
The grown hats come after the "La Bomba", a slamma with a half meter wide cremp that all wear from Rihanna to Emily Ratakovski.
The cultural mark behind this very unpractical hat flooded by social media has sent to the show mole another enormous creation – a slamming beach bag, which is almost as large as a model in the swimming swimming.
Dark orange rafia bag leemed by rafia shakes and armed handcuffs from white skin on the Paris week of fashion was an exhibition piece of the La Riviera collection spring/summer 2019 from Jacquemuse.
The filmlist Luke Armitage told F.EMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for the summer – since the designer had such a great success, it would be hardly possible to ignore demand for excessively large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Scotland independent schools have a number of academic successes, and it continues in 2018 with other excellent results of the tests. Individual and group successes in sports, artistic, musical and other community activities only underscore it.
These schools have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools – SCIS, and are trying to provide their students and parents with the best level of services.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can propose and implement individually adapted school education plans, we observe that modern languages are still popular and demanded subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man the language he understands, it goes straight into his head.
If you speak his own tongue with him, it goes straight into his heart."
It is important to note that if we want to build relations and trust in people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year's tests show that languages are at the first place of tables, with the highest level of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned a foreign language have reached the best marks A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that the highest mark A reached 72 per cent of the students of Mandarin, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will need in the future.
Languages as subjects that students choose are equally respected in the study plans of independent and other schools as well as the subjects of STEM (science, technology, technical obstructions and mathematics).
The study carried out by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for the reasons for which employers are indicating problems in the employment of free places, 17 per cent of the insufficient language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly needed in preparing young people for their future career.
Since more job opportunities require languages, these skills are essential in the globalized world.
Whatever a person chooses any career, if he learns the second language, he will have a real advantage in the future that he has such a life - life skill.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person speaking more languages will receive an automatic advantage before competitiveness.
According to a study organized by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in Great Britain, 75 percent of them have not been able to speak a foreign language sufficiently well so that they can have conversations, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, specifically 15%, was French.
It is therefore important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially the languages that develop economies, they will be more likely to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school is different from what languages he teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others learn languages that are considered the most important to the Great Britain in the view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child cares about, he will always have in independent schools to choose from several languages with teachers who are in the field of experts.
The Scottish independent schools are committed to ensuring the educational environment that children prepare and equip the skills needed to succeed, whatever they are expecting in the future.
At this point, it cannot be denied that the languages in the global business environment are essential for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered “the international communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and dignity to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will be presented on Sunday in San Diego for the first time in Lakers' dress
The fans who are looking forward to the first time LeBron James joins Los Angeles Lakers will soon wait.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James will play the Sunday opening match in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes it's going to take.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton reported on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
Last week after the training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the pre-session.
"In this stage, I don't need pre-season fights," he said.
Trump performance in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump in Wheeling in West Virginia is starting the campaign wave.
It's the first of five haveins planned for the next week, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the cessation of the vote on the confirmation of his candidates for a free place in the highest court, Trump wants to receive support for the coming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans are standing in November elections before the risk of loss of Congress.
At what hour is Trump's show starting tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 east time, today on Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's imaink in Western Virginia you can watch online below via live transfer on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearing a candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, which took place this week and was very tense about the charge of inappropriate sexual behaviour. The confirmation of the Senate is expected to be delayed a week before the FBI investigation is conducted.
But the main goal of this wave of possessions is to help the Republicans get a pace before the November elections.
According to the Reuters campaign organizers, President Trumpa said that these five meetings in the next week are intended to “add the energy to volunteers and supporters so that the Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives”.
"Control over the Senate is so important for his agenda that the president will take campaigns to as many states as possible in this disturbing season," the Reuters spokesman of the Trump campaign said to the agency Reuters, who did not wish to be appointed.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, we could have visited today in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling by supporters from “Ohia and Pennsylvania and watch him from Pittsburgh. ”
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits Western Virginia, in which he won more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Western Virginia Patrick Morrisey who remains in the surveys.
"For Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the president has to come to help him in research," says a politologist from the Westovirgin University Simon Haeder.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team showed that it was to fight the stomach to keep hopes from Sunday singles
After three one-sided fights, Saturday couples may be exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The flipping whip is a completely invented sports concept, but the players really trust him, and the most of these competitions.
So where's the slipper going now?
"They took six points and now it's four, so we take it in the way that the wave apparently moves a bit towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, leads by four points, and there are still twelve.
As Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in the sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, for example, the forms of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each can admire three points of four.
Spieth was dying when he passed from the loft to the green and walked by an example.
The famous screams still strengthened the continuation of his bike when he managed the key pat to gain the whole game when they were with Thomas after two holes back by two.
His patch, who won the 15-hole match, met with a similar scream that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own match," said Spieeth.
That's all each of these players left.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, unsputably the main story of Ryder cup.
The strange, but cute couples of Europe are four of four and they can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only two who did not hit the hole on Saturday afternoon but passed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again Friday morning."
The progress and the way energy flows both towards a violent audience and confirms from him that these are the players designed for Sunday victory, and that there will be no more favorite player than Fleetwood or Molinari until the sunset of Le Golf Naitional.
It's best both at the same time for a different hole.
However, talks about European glory remain early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked shortly with Sergei Garcia, the hero of the morning games of four balls when he was parsed with Alex Norren.
The hole and two dables on the front nine were buried by Spain and Sweden into a ruin that they did not come from.
But on Sunday, no one will help you.
The games of two two balls are so fascinating when you closely watch the interactions of people in a couple, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better so far as a team and has taken significant advantage by the last day, but this game of two couples has also shown that the U.S. team has a stomach to fight, which some, in particular from the states, have doubted.
By the final day, Ryder Cupu leads Europe with 10-6 points score
Europe gets a healthy advantage by the last day of Ryder Cupu, afterwards, from the Saturday two games on two balls, the score of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly almost twice won over the struggling Tiger Woods, decided to make four cuts in Le Golf National.
The European Party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to maintain the trophy lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the morning games on two balls with the American side that failed in series 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in four, winning two fights, but they couldn't get into deficit.
The party of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the Sunday 12 matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newman who wins four points behind, while he and Molinari, who have received the nickname "Molliwood" after the sensible weekend, are only the second couple who won four points from his four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After the defeat of the Woods and Patrick Reed players in the game on two balls and then smoothly defeated the tired Woods and the US newman Bryson Dechambeau even more importantly 5&4.
Woods, who stretched two matches on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in the game of two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after the morning game on two balls, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in the 2&1 defeat of Dustina Johnson and Brooks Koepky - units and threes in the world's ladder.
However, Europe did not have it on this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris victory throughout the line.
The three-fold main winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas ran two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a tough 2&1 victory over Spain John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game on two balls and later returned to beat the two Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game of couples, although two first holes lost.
Only twice in Ryder Cupu history, the team returns from the four-point deficit to the two games, even though as the defending party of Furyk needs only a remise to obtain the trophy.
After the second day he was the best in two days, it seems to be a Sunday attack behind them.
North Korea says that “in no case” will not be armed unilaterally and without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said on Saturday that the continued UN sanctions have deepened their confidence in the United States and, under such circumstances, the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual valuable meeting that North Korea adopted “significant measures of goodwill” in the past year, such as stoping nuclear and missile tests, demolition of nuclear tests and promises that they will not spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see the relevant response by the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, trust in our national security will not come and there will be no unilateral disarmament under such circumstances."
While Ri repeated the famous North Korean complaint on the opposition of Washington to the “consolidated” approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for each step, its statement appeared to be important in the fact that it did not refuse unilateral denuclearization only because Pchjongjang had been through it in the past.
Ri mentioned the common statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the President of America and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim committed to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean poloostrove” while Trump pledged security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea seeks a formal end of the 1950-53 war conflict, but the United States said Pchjongjang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the challenge to release hard international sanctions against North Korea.
“USA insists on ‘the first denuclearization’ and increases the pressure on sanctions to force their goals and even object to ‘the declaration of the end of the war’”, said Ri.
"The impression that sanctions can lead us to knees is a dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our untrustedness."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader emphasized in the UN earlier week.
Instead, the Minister emphasized three meetings of Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: “If this question of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come into such a patical situation.”
However, the ton of Riho's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he said to the UN Valley Meeting that the targeting of missiles in North Korea in the U.S. territory was inevitable after the "Mr. Bad President" Trump named Kim "rake man" for a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations Trump, who threatened “a total destruction” of North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that there must still be many work and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is fully denuclearised.
In Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame, he said: “If it takes two years, three or five months, it doesn't matter. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pchjongjang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the promotion of sanctions of the Security Council must continue instantly and without stopping until we realize the complete, final, verified denuclearization”
The Security Council is unanimously supporting sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in the effort to undermine the financing of nuclear programmes and programmes of balistic missile Pchjongjangu.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly by the party and Pompeo declared that the next month Pchjongjang will be visited to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pchjongjang in July and declared that progress had been made, just to make North Korea announced that he had incurred “gangster requirements” within a few hours.
North Korea has committed a meeting with Moon this month to unmount the missile area and the nuclear complex, if the United States adopt “suitable measures”.
He stated that Kim informed him that “suitable measures” in which he hopes are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore to normalize relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard will attend a course to teach them a sufficient rest
The new course at the Harvard University this year has made all his students sleep more, trying to fight the growing macho culture study all night when students are not sleeping and encouraging with caffeine.
Academy found that students in the world's world's most famous universities are often helpless when it comes to the basis of care for themselves.
The course proposed Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School Faculty and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a woman's hospital that he believes to be the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after he talked about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“A girl came to me at the end and said, ‘Why are you telling me just now, in my last yearbook? ’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, explains to students the basic information about how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall comfort.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatric professor at Harvard Medical School and executive Director of Health Services of the University, said that the university decided to introduce a course after finding that students were really sleeping during a week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of student railways where students click on cups with coffee, jackets, tennis and books on the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance affects the lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
In other parts, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of campus with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that student behaviour will not immediately change.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes to health," said Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride in the "study all night" still exists, he added that modern technologies and still growing pressure on students mean that there is also a problem of lack of sleep.
The enough sleep of good quality should be a "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gathering, because sleep deprivation switches the brain into the hunger regime, so man is still hungry.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler propose a course that during the first year in Harvard graduated from one of his classes.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the whole course.
He hopes that the next step will be requested by all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before entering a competitive institution.
Professor recommended that students consider setting the alarm time to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights that can solve your circuit rhythm, which leads to problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal drowned Gerrard's husband
The Rangers suffered another loss when the Dolly Mengy hit identified Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
The Ibrox party tried to record its first victory from 4 to 1 February on St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as a manager to leave his post eight points from the front leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes ago half-time, and the Rangers composition seemed without inspiration and determination to combat.
While the Rangers are now falling to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and right behind the Hibernian team to the difference of one branch.
And there might have been more problems with Rangers after the line judge Calum Spence had been treated with a head injury after he was probably hit by the object from the perspective.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, which moved around Ayr to the Betfred Cupu semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, which took the Hearts points last week and would be pleased as his well-trained men choked his rival on every step.
Rangers may have controlled holding, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score only two minutes after the start, when Menga first let Scott Pittman go to Allan McGregor's gate, but the booker buried his great chance.
A remote free cop of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the back post.
The Rangers took over control, but it seemed that in the last third there was more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he should have a penalty for a four-hour lead when Steven Lawless and the judge, Steven Thomson, hit the Colombian challenge from the table.
Rangers only handled two targets in the first half, but the former Branchman Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassana Coulibala and a mild shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener could be against the game running after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it for the last time.
Rangers couldn't handle the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Menga to a easy final.
Gerrard took action at a break and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had almost immediate result when the wing broke into Morelos, but the impossible Kelly fought himself from the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into the game of exactly the kind they like when Lithgow and Halkett metaled one long ball after another.
Holt's party could have deepened its scope in the final stages, but McGregor was well set up to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
The substitute Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to punishment when he was screwed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned back.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger's Reader
And now the page from our Sunday morning almanach: 30 September 1882, today it's 136 years, and it's still coming... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measureing radioactiveness, an invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger's reader.
The Station of Science Geiger Counter then also became a standing pop culture, such as in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado”, in the main role of those seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man: "What is this for God?"
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s reader that is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put on these listeners, you can really hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactives in minerals.
Evans: “Oh, yeah, now it's really blowing up! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that brings his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method includes extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the lab
Then they can "see" protein that is common to many cancers and then inject again
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with several types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify dangerous cells was missing the cancer of eggs for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the lab, so they can "see" protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-used into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “regulated the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
Similar approach when immune cells were taken from patients and “learned” was to focus on cancer cells has already been promoted in treatment with leukemia.
Kanye West participated in the pro-trump preaching, in his magic hat, after his show at the SNL.
It didn't work well.
Kanye West was printed in the Saturday Night Live studio after a confused performance, during which he praised President of the United States Donald Trump and said he would be running in 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he was wearing a hat Make America Great Again, he started swimming at democrats and repeating his support for President Trump.
"I often talk to white men and they say, "How much can you like Trump, is he racist?"
If I had disturbed racism, I would have been in America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL started a show of parodia with Matt Damon in the main role where the Hollywood Star was joking about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court Committee on Ford's rape from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't transmitted, West's theateral speech recorded on social media by Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to laugh at West.
West also complained to the audiences that he had had his head decoration to eat well in the behind the scenes.
“In the back of the scene, I was freaked out.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
That's ridiculous!
They also said I was in the wrong place," says Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Would you like to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "pull his superman suit because that means you can't say what to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments only served the audience’s buzzing at least twice, and the members of the SNL seemed to be distressed, says Variety, and one person even said: “The entire studio is completely silent. ”
West was invited as a late replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing the song I Love dressed as a bottle of water Perrier.
West received support from the TPUS Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous characters: Thank you for setting up the SES.”
But the hosting talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that West was " just who he was, and that's absolutely amazing."
“BUT I WANT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “art”), which I believe is representing and sending to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Before the rapper show, he announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West."

The game Thrones star Kit Harrington started in toxic masculine
Kit Harrington is known for his role Jona Snow with a sword in hand in a violent medium-century fantasy of the HBO series.
The actress, 31 years old, however, came out of the macho hero stereotype and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be claimed to deserve respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he believed that "something is wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculine in the age #MeToo.
The whale, who recently married his star of Rose Leslie’s throne, also admitted that the problem was “a very strong ” to be expressed.
"In this moment I personally feel pretty strong - what happened so bad with the masculine?" he said.
"What do we teach adolescents about the problem we now see here?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic maleness because of its very male figures.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do the boys learn on TV, on the streets, they're growing a sense that every man needs to have a site like that?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our day - how do you change it?
Because the young men must have changed to worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in no prequel or sequel of the throne game after the end of the series, because he has enough “fights and horses”.
Since November, Kit will play in the renewed Real West of Sam Shepard, which is a story of the film producer and his brother, the thief.
The actress recently discovered that meeting with his current wife Rose for the best of the Game of the throne.
“I recognized my wife during the series, so he gave me my future family and my whole life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the object of the love of the Kita figure, John Snow, in this fantasy series of Emma's price.
A couple of people entered in June 2018 on the lands of Leslie's family house in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China indicates 14% increase in new cases
China announced 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are affected in the country according to official numbers.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases were transferred by sex, which meant a change against the past.
Traditionally, HIV is spread over some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have infected HIV in this way has been declined nearly to zero, the Chinese healthcare indicated at the Yunnan Province Conference.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people annually.
Transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is allegedly still expanded.
In view of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these contacts.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of the effort to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff would let the GOP data of Senators avoid, the terms of "dangerous lies" and "conspiration theory"
The American Ambassador Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday the claim that a member of her employees sent three republic senators to the lawmakers.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the charges were supported by “ultra-rightes” scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despisable lies," Waters said in her statement on Twitter.
The information published reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for American Senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the negotiation of the Senate for sexual abuse by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
There was some way out of information after three Senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address, which is the source of contributions, is linked to the Waters office and published information on members of the Waters staff, says Hill.
“This unfounded claim is absolutely false and absolute lie” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been threatened by these false and false accusations - was not in any case responsible for the escape of this information.
This unfair claim is absolutely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly served online criticism, including the former press secretary of the White House of Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that there is no temperament to be a member of the Congress."
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
They can't be opposed.
He must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They must be calm and not excited."
It seemed that Fleischer compared Waters' response to the critics of democrats towards Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticised because he seemed too angry during the fourth hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who participated in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it was true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office warned “the competent authorities and authorities acting in criminal proceedings on these deceits.
"We shall ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for everyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English again interferes with reviews – a weaker spy parodie Rowan Atkinson
It's already common to look for Brexit in every new British film with a British trend, which seems to be the case of Johnny English renewed in a series of action parodies - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this awkward satir on the subject how obviously bad nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this exhausted, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to spoil things in a completely new way - that name more than anything else signal that it was a wide comic creation designed for non-Anglish speaking film audience.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a little of inspector Clouseau, a patch of Mr. Bean and a big piece of the guy who sang the only tone in the Chariots of Fire at the celebration beginning of the Olympic games in London 2012.
The figure is also originally based on a traveler and an international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the already forgotten Barclaycard advertising, and left behind chaos.
In this last edition, there will be one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he was approaching the helicopter in the middle-aged armor and the rotor's bowls were shortly screaming about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite subdimensional and strangely superior, especially when "serious" filmmarks such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offering a comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is rather as if it was designed for children than adults, and for me, the crazy tramps of Johnny English are so inventive and focused, like Atkinson's silent film gags in the person of Mr. Bean.
The persistently current assumption is that Great Britain has serious problems.
Cybernetic hacker infiltrated the British super secret spy network and discovered the identity of all British agents in the field to frighten the agent in the service - too little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the Prime Minister, which is a pompézious and obsessed figure that is already suffering under the complete decline of political inpopularity: Emma Thompson plays this favor of Theresa May as best as possible, but there's nothing in the scenario.
Her rapporteur advisors inform her that once each active spy is threatened, someone will have to retire.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as director in some luxury device, but also gives record lessons about being a secret agent: there are a few nice gags, because English offers a spy academy like Rock School.
They returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his former long - suffering partner, Bough, who was playing Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the commander of the submarine, an afflicted figure that Vicki Pepperdine's talent may be a little waste.
So Batman and Robin are back in action and meet with the beautiful femme fatals of Ophelia Bullet, which Olga Kurylenko played.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously subjected to the magic of a charismaic technological billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer crimes: a vicious Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyseum full of frachy patalias: masked as waitress will burn the French restaurant; they will create chaos when they go through Volta's luxury yachts; and English will launch a clean anarchy when they try to know with Volt's home inner reality.
All the essays are surely ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and violent it is, it has something in it from child television.
It's quite a measure matter.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that really fits his talent?
Labourists deny that they would develop a plan for Englishmen to work four days a week to get paid in five days
The Labourist Party of Jeremy Corbyn should consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and pay for five.
The Party allegedly wishes that the boss companies provide savings to workers that result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
The employees would enjoy the class weekend - but they would still take the same reward.
The sources argue that this idea would be “good” to the economic agenda of the party and plans to boost the country for workers.
The transition to the four-day working week was approved by the Congress of the Union as a way that workers can use changing economies.
The long-term labourist member stated for Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is the wish that enters the positions of the party to balance the economy for workers and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labourist Party will not be the first to support this idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the labourist party as a whole.
The labourist speaker said: “The four - day working week is not our party’s policy, and the party does not consider it. ”
The Shadow Officer John McDonnell used the work conference last week to fill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell has declared that he is committed to returning energy from "anonimous directors" and "scientists" in utilities.
The Shadow Officer's plans also mean that the current shareholders in water companies must not return to their total share, as the labourist government could carry out the "guards" on the basis of a perception.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees in the company's administrative councils and to create funds for their own own property, which are transferring 10 % of their own capital of private enterprises to employees who have the right to pay annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in the show "60 minutes" whether the FBI investigation could change their views.
The FBI's investigation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has deducted the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week and raises the question of whether the finding of the office could swing any Republican Senators to draw their support.
In an interview from the Sunday "60 minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened when the charge came out, and he said, "You did it?"
He was determined, determined, clear."
However , Graham's decision is inconvenient .
"I have already made my decision over Brett Kavanaugh and would mean a really explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it hardly," Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those whom she appointed could verify.
It's been 36 years.
I can't see anything would change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what did he do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, in New York, the annual musical activities of the Global Citizen Festival will be performed, which offers a very impressive series of stars and an impressive mission at the end of world poverty.
The Festival Global Citizen in the seventh year welcomes tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise their awareness of the real goal of action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was introduced in 2012, is the extension of the Global Poverty project, the international groups to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
In order to be able to obtain a free ticket (if you were not willing to pay a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, e-mail to the world leader, call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was the Global Citizen now 12 years before he reaches his goal?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with a free concert in a really way of convinceing them to require action, or is it just another case called "clicktivism" - people who feel that by signing an online petition or leaving tweet, something changes?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by his favourites, trying to achieve various goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to the fact that the world leaders will notify commitments and measures of more than $37 billion, which will affect lives more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, a group of 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that secured funds have a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, the British partnership of investors and implementers who committed to “help children to grow into their full potential”, which promises to provide Rwanda $35 million for help in the end of subconditional food in the region after receiving more than 4.700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can only make a note in history," Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman said the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5,000 shares called for the U.K. to improve mother and children, the government announced the financing of the Power of Nutrition project, which addressed 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your web site with a question, “why do you think we can end extreme poverty? ”
Global Citizen answered: “It will be a long and hard way - sometimes we fall and fail.
But as well as the great civil rights and the movement against the apartheid before us, we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae belongs to one of the actors on this year's year in New York to host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The USA could use the marine for the “bloc” that would protect Russian energy exports - the Minister of Interior
Washington may "if necessary" avoid the navy to prevent the invasion of Russian energy on markets, including the Middle East, discovered by the US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a reason for examining new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy as in Eastern Europe, in the southern abdominal of Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States have the opportunity to make sure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy is not marketing," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the action carried out by the consumer energy alliance, which is an unprofit group that is considered “the voice of the energy consumer in the United States”.
He compared Washington's approach and dealings with Russia and Iran, and noted that they were practically the same.
“Economic possibility for Iran and Russia is more than investment in or replacement of engine materials”, he stated, while referring to Russia as a “one-intentioned” player with the economy depending on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes because Trump's administration is to strengthen the export of its fossil gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
For this purpose, the officials of Trump's administration, including the US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to step away from the “inappropriate” project of Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “home” of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that Nord Stream 2 gas supply valued $11 billion to double the existing capacity of the circuit to 110 billion cubic metres is a purely economic project.
Kreml claims that the zealous resistance to Washington against the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of a non-competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to develop pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandar Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The United States has taken a view from Germany, which reaffirms its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the United States to avoid EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to "see closely" the presidential candidacy in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the elections in the middle of the election period, the "see closely" the president's candidacy.
During the Council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidature.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and repair our broken government, including the supreme woman's position," she said, according to The Hill.
"I will take a close look at the presidential candidacy after November 6th."
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said that “he leads this country in the wrong direction. ”
"I fear the bones of what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment to the highest judge Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren on Twitter said: “Of course we need a FBI investigation before vote.”
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters do not think that they should be running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters from Massachusetts said that the senator should not be running, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the candidature of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% for candidature and 48% against it.
Among the other highly built democratic names that were discussed in relation to the potential candidacy by 2020, the former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders includes the former Vice-President Joe Biden.
Biden said he'll decide officially in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palina for a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through after his return, may concern other families that feel the consequences of PTSD and some injuries with which our soldiers are coming back," the audience said to meet Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest “the elephant in the room ” and told her son and other war veterans that “they are returning a little different, returning to healing, returning and asking if there is any respect for the things their colleagues and airmen, and every other member of the army, gives their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence attack on a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and holding weapons in drunkness, Dan Bennett, speaker of the Vasilla police department.
18 States, D.C. supports the call for new asylum policy
Eighteen States and District of Columbia support the legal call for new measures of the American government, which support asylum from victims fleeing from gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of the 18 states and the district in Washington issued a brief report on Friday to support the asylum applicant and question this measure, stated NBC.
The full name of the prosecutor in the case of Grace v. Sessions, which was issued in August by the United States Civil Freedom Organization against Federal Politics, has not been revealed.
She said that her partner “and his sons and members of the violent gang ” abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
Attorneys of the supporting states described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations facing all the problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed the decision of the Appealing Senate for Immigrants from 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants to flee from domestic violence to request asylum.
The General Prosecutor Karl Racine of D.C. stated in the Friday statement that the new measure “is ignoring the decades of state, federal and international law”.
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the request, and such a obstacle is violated by the principle”, said a short friend.
Attorneys further briefly argumented that the policy that denies the entry of immigrants would damage the US economy and said it was more likely to become a businessman and “do the necessary work”.
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in the field of immigration not to give asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“The asylum is available for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or because of the political opinion," the Sessions said in its statement of 11 June.
Asylum was never targeted to mitigate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palo, where the number of victims has risen twice, race in searching for survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her hot boy in the evacuation center in the sprayed town of Palo.
"Each minute, the ambulance brings other bodies.
The pure water is rare."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, choosing through underground things and trying to save anything they can find.
Thousands of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by a earthquake of size 7,5 were protected.
Some wounds, including Dwhi Harris, who suffered the spinal fracture and shoulder, rested at Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of continuing severe subsequent strokes.
The tears filled his eyes when he felt that the violent earthquake shaked the hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared the room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was incorporated into a ruin of the wall," said Harris for the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "scanning" propaganda advertising
A week after the official Chinese journal published a four-page advertising in the American diary, which was devoted to mutual benefits from trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Peking of using the US press to spread propaganda.
The American President Donald Trump mentioned the payable supplement in China Daily in the De Moines Register, the state of the largest sales newspaper in Iowa last Wednesday, after accusing China of trying to interfere with the US Congress elections in November 6th.
Trump's accusation that Peking tried to interfere with American elections marked what American officials said that the Reuters agency was a new phase of escalating campaign by Washington to develop pressure on China.
While foreign governments are common to advertise commercials to support trade, Peking and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that is demonstrated at the level of mutual imports.
Chinese legal sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in countries like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador in China, and former long-year governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Peking injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China is now duplicating this bullshit by publicizing propaganda advertising in our own free press."
"In the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses an American valuable tradition of free speech and free press by placed advertising to Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in a newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited disagreeable votes and you will not see any real reflection of unrelated opinions that the Chinese might have on the disturbing economic path of China, since the media belong to the company "China Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish the offer ” of his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
The Republicans leave their voters before elections for the debacle with Kavanaugh, warn the analysts
How many top republicans defend the candidate at the Supreme Judge Brett Kavanauga, who faces several charges of sexual attack, the analyst warned that during the coming elections in the mid-period, especially from women.
Emotions around this case have been extremely high, and most Republicans in the record already say they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be restored," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell's University School in Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will in the last moment strive to investigate the FBI will be enough to calm the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the chief advisor and speaker of the MoveOn Group, the newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters scandaled “Lestopad is approaching!” on a demonstration in the hall of the Senate, where the Republicans who are responsible for the Justice Commission decided to name Kavanaugh even after the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic stated.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break the records," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it's already been high, it's true."
It could, however, be higher, especially among the hesitating women's elections in the suburb and the younger voters, 18 to 29 years, who do not like the president, but often do not choose."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, the analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, there would be a resistance.
"The confused mess for the GOP has been removed," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the capital, it is also about how the Republicans managed and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, the US Priority Director, the group that helps vote democrats, pointed out the reporting channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in the opinion of whom to trust in the light of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimony, with a little more sympathy to the other appointed.
The new YouGov study shows that 41 percent of the respondents were definitely or likely believed in the testimony of Ford, while 35 percent indicated that they were sure or probably trusting Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent suggested that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges raised by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, stated the Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate Court Committee under the oath last week that the drunk Kavanaugh attacked her at 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her its genitalities at the party during his study at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new Internet and pre-run Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of World Wide Web, starts startup, trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company building on the Open Source Platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive conversation with the Fast Company Berners-Lee, he was joking that the objective of the project's Intrust was “world overcome”.
"We must do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or sub.
It may contain lists of contacts, tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like the Google Disk, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's on the personal online storage of data is that it's entirely on the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal power through data”.
The purpose of the project Inrupt is to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform to be available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some employees working on the project have cooperated on the project and community of voluntary programmers.
Since this week, technological developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications by means of tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about making a complete change where all their business models overnight are turned up.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In his contribution to the media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that by sending the Inrupt project, it is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Berners-Lee was an influenced voice in the discussion of net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Spiritual celebration that Victoria Cross received during World War 1
The celebration took place for hundreds of years since the only Spiritual Church of England won Victoria’s cross during the first World War.
Lieutenant Reverend Bernard Vann received an appreciation on September 29, 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was killed by the shooter, and he never knew that he had gained the highest British military appreciation.
His two grandchildren revealed his memorial stone on Saturday at the rushden feast in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the stone was “genially symbolic ” that it was discovered for exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his batalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin very dense fog and strong shooting from field works and bullets."
Later, he entered the first line and with “the highest courage ” led the line forward before he dropped himself separately into the firefield and knocked three disconnected units.
Lieutenant Vanna killed a German shooter on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
72 - year - old Michael Vann said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do but at the same time something humiliating. ”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, after the show led by the Brantwood Imperial Youth Band, put a vein.
Michael Vann said that “he felt great honor to participate in the show, ” and he added that“ the courage of the true hero is a support that many will provide. ”
MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead, they got Peppa pigs.
Imagine it, you've been waiting all night to watch the screwed Bellator 206, just to deny your main event.
The account of San José contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasts, took place in Great Britain all night on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegar Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, the observers in Great Britain remained amazed when the reporting changed to the Peppa pig show.
Some remained unexcited after they stayed awake until early in the morning for the fight.
One of the Twitter fans described a change in the broadcast for children as a "some form of bad joke."
"It is not suitable at 6:00 a.m., and therefore it is necessary to send child shows," said Dave Schwartz, a higher vice-president for marketing and communication to the Bellator after he was asked for this transfer.
"Peppa, yes."
President of Bellator Scott Coker said that they would work on the program so that the viewers in Great Britain would be involved in the future.
"I think that when I think about the broadcast, we can probably handle it," Cooker said.
"But there's six hours in the morning Sunday, and we can't handle it until Sunday, Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and back, and not all of them were very friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's fault.
I promise you, that's not gonna happen again.
We reduce it to five matches instead of six – as we usually do – and we have tried all the strength to keep the promise given to the fans and we failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "minor" because of sexuality
The Olympic jumping into the water Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of minority to everyone because of his sexuality – but it motivated him to go to success.
A 24 - year - old sportsman said he didn't realize that “not all were like him until he was in high school. ”
On the first Disk Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, represented by Lauren Laverne, said he spoke loudly about gay rights to give the other " hope".
He also said that he was less interested in being a parent in the Olympiade victory.
A regular moderator of the long-term Kirsty Young show had a few months off because of the disease.
Daley, who appeared as a runner in Lavern's first program, stated that he felt “minor ” than anyone else who grew up with him, because“ it was not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls. ”
He said: “So far, these feelings of minority and distinction were real things that gave me strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “Someone, ” he said not to disappoint anyone who might find out how it is with his sexuality.
The double owner of the bronze olympic medal became a warrior for the rights of LGBT movement with a high profile and used his presence at this year's Games of Commonwealth in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he responded because he had a feeling of happiness that he could live openly without consequences, and he wanted to add “the hope to others. ”
This triple world champion stated that he was in love with a man, a US film director Dustina Lance Black, who met in 2013, “was caught unprepared.”
Daley's owner of Oscar, who's 20 years older, married last year, but said that age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much in your young age – he was at his first Olympiada when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was not easy to find someone at the same age who experienced similar rises and falls.
The two of them adopted the son of Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said that he "has changed his entire angle of view."
"If you asked me last year, it would be all like "I want to get a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
My olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011, aged 40 years after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said that his father didn't have to die, and the last thing he asked was if they had tickets on London Olympiad in 2012 because he wanted to be in front.
"I couldn't tell him – you won't be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held him for a hand when he stopped breathing and when he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The year Daley attended the Olympiads in 2012 and got a bronze.
"I knew that I had dreamed about this all my life -- jumping in front of our homes at the Olympic Games, I don't know better feeling," he said.
It also inspired the choice of his first song – Heather Small Stream – which resonated with him at the beginning of the Olympiada and continued to cause a goose skin in it.
The Desert Island Discs show is sent to the BBC Radio 4 station on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of form, on Saturday at Ryder Cup ended on the cage
The American Phil Mickelson would have reached the record on Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup game, but he would have to fix the shape to prevent that it was an unhappy mistress.
Mickelson, who played on the events held every two years on the sub-12 record, sent Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday Fourballs and four-fours on the bench.
Instead of being in the center of the event, as he often used in the United States, he spent five times of the main winner of his day in the middle between the cheerleaders and the work on the game in a row he hoped to fix what he was bothering.
This 48-year-old player has never been the directest of drivers, not even on the top of his career, so it is not an ideal choice for the narrow field Le Golf National, where a long membership field routinely punishes a broken shot.
And if the golf playground is not quite anxious about himself, he's faced with Mickelson in the ninth Sunday match with the British Open Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches this week with Tommy Fleetwood's new team.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, escaped the rapid appearance, Mickelson's sword could turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband and gave nothing else.
"He fully understands the role he had today, he cried me on his back, gave me his hand around my shoulder and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He believes himself so much.
He's a member of the Hall of Slam and in the past and this week he was so useful for these teams.
I guess I couldn't imagine he'd play two swords.
I imagined more, but that's how it evolved, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will overcome Nick Fald's record in most wests of Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of the career in Ryder Cup, which never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson reached 18 victories, 20 losses and seven remises, even though Furyk says that his presence to the team has brought some unmaterial results.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and is a great companion in the team's room," he explained.
"I think younger players also enjoyed fun walking at him this week, which was fun to watch.
It gives a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, from experience knows that a great leadership to the singles of the last days in Ryder Cup can easily change into a uncomfortable ride.
Dane debuted in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where the company led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point scope over the Americans, but they got to the target level with close victory 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You must still remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklin, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but only closely," said Bjorn, on the picture, after watching when we won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of that team showed me that it wasn't behind us.
You'll be totally bored tomorrow.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all those points are on the board.
We have a goal, and we try to get the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
I said I'll focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand on the other side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn, delighted in how his players led at a complex golf field, added: “I would never do it myself.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Tomorrow, individual performances are prepared, and that's too hard.
It's great to be out with a partner when it works well, but when you want to be there for yourself, your capacity of the golf player is fully checked.
That's the message you have to pass to the players, get the best tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you, and he has to go and get the best out of yourself.
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will ensure that his players play better as individuals than as partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieeth and Justin Thomas, who won three points from four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great vomitings, when he was part of the victory team in Brooklyn, to end as defeated when Europe reached the "Miracle in Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players to move forward until the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to begin quickly as in Brooklyn, as in Medinah.
When this rate goes in one direction, it puts significant pressure on the middle matches.
According to this, we have set up a composition and ensure that the boys feel like you know, as if we were to magic tomorrow."
Thomas got an assignment to try to lead an attack and stand up with Rory McIlroy in the top game with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other Europeans in the upper half of the series.
“I went with this group of boys in this order, because I think it covers the whole road,” Bjorn said about his choice of singles.
Germany's new warship has been relocated
The latest German marine fregate was recognised in 2014 to replace older warships from the cold war age, but will not be available for at least one year because of the wrong systems and the snow coast, local media indicate.
The operation of the boat leader “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the entire new fregates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, according to Die Zeit's quoting army, was now deferred to the first half of 2019.
The vessel was to become a part of the Navy in 2014, but the difficult problems after the supplier disadvantaged the fate of this ambitious project.
As a compensation for the ageing fregats of Bremen class, four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the Navy ordered in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with an effective artillery, a number of anti-flying and anti-floating ballistic bullets and some hidden technologies such as the reduced radar and infrared and akustic elements.
Other important functions include the long-term maintenance period – the latest fregats should be placed until two years outside the home port.
However, continuous delays mean that the top seaships, which were supposed to allegedly allow Germany to send powers to the overseas, will be expired, notes Die Zeit journal.
The famous F125 fregat came to the newspaper last year when the German Navy officially refused to operate and returned to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the manufacturer after the transfer.
It was only a little known about the reasons for return, but the German media quoted a number of major “software errors and obstacles on metal elements”, which would cause the warship to be unused in the fighting.
Software disruptions were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will operate the crew of some 120 mariners – a half of the workers needed on the Bremen class fregates.
It also turned out that the ship has a significant overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to add future innovation.
It is believed that the 7 000-tonne boat Rheinland-Pfal would be twice as heavy as ships like classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the obstacles on metal elements, the price of the entire project is the problem, including the training of the crew.
It is said that from the original 2.2 billion euros, the price has risen at 3.1 billion euros.
The problems with the latest fregates have been particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German maritime power is declined.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament defence committee, confirmed that the maritime troops are really "come on ships capable of planting".
The representative stated that the problems have been collected continuously because the old ships have been excluded from operation but have not been granted any replacement.
He lamented that none of the fregats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could become part of the marine equipment.
National Trust Organization listens to the secret life of the nettiers
A new research on discovery is being conducted on the headquarters of the Scotland Highlands, how the netopers use the landscape in the hunting of food.
There is hope that finding the research will put a new light on the behavior of unique flying insects and will help to manage future activities for the preservation of this species.
The study carried out by the National Trust Association for Scotland will be followed by whistleblowers and the smallest and brown long-earth and water in the Botanical Gardens of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the key areas of this non-product, which will monitor the activities of netopyrs throughout the year.
Employees and volunteers of NHS will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings finds the frequency of calling netopyrs and what individual species do.
The map of the habitat and the report will then be issued to create a detailed landscape of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Consultant for Natural Resources, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are the most important and how individual species use them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitat, such as the creation of a port, and the best procedure in maintaining forested areas for netopyrs and other related species.
In Scotland and the whole United Kingdom, the inflammation of the population in the past century is large.
They are threatened by construction and territorial development that affect colonies and the natural environment.
Risk can also represent wind turbines and lighting, as well as traps for flies and chemical treatment of construction materials and cat attacks.
The nerds are not really blind.
But because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful in hunting.
They're using a substantial echo-location technique to track the bugs and obstacles in the flight.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the netopiras very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly conduct research, colonie controls and sometimes rescue work.
This organization even set up the first and only preserved reservation in the Threave headquarters in Dumfries and Gallovey, which is home of eight of the ten species of netopyers in Scotland.
The headquarters David Thompson states that this is an ideal territory for them.
"There in Threave we have a great area for the netopyers," he said.
"We have old buildings, many ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's too many things that we don't know about the netopyers, so the work we're doing here and in other places will help us better understand what they need to survive."
It emphasizes the importance of the control of the netopiers before starting maintenance work in real estate, because it is possible that ignorant destruction of one mother's nest can kill up to 400 females and youths, which can destroy the entire local population.
The nerds are protecting and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, disturb them or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scotian representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to attach her hand to work and help.
She said: "We must learn a lot about our untouchers and a lot of species that we do not know how their population is.
Ronaldo refuses the charges of rape and his lawyers are about to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo marked the charge of rape for “fake news” and stated that people“ want to be seen ” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German diary of Der Spiegel, who informed these charges.
This Portuguese and the attacker for Juventus was accused of rape by the American Kathryn Mayorgy in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Accordingly, he paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the case, the Der Spiegel journal informed her on Friday.
A few hours after the publication of the charges, 33-year-old Ronaldo in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million trackers and marked the information as “fake reports”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold holder of the appreciation of the Golden Ball to the camera.
"They want to feed on my least.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their work.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said a smile player.
According to the Reuters agency, the lawyers are going to charge Ronald Der Spiegel's journal of unsubscribed charges, which they have named “inadmissible suspicion notifications in the private area”.
The lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player will require compensation for “moral damage at the level of the corresponding severity of violations, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times”.
The alleged incident was to be held in June 2009 in the hotel Palms Hotel and in the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the game, where according to the documentation filed at the court of Clarky County District Court in Nevada, she was analytically raped.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo kneeled and told her that he was “99 percent ” of “cladias” and disappointed by “one percent”.
The papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensus.
Mayorga also declared that she went to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement, because “she was afraid of revenge ” and was afraid of“ public humiliation. ”
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now trying to renew the procedure because she is still traumatized as an alleged incident.
Ronalda, at the time of the charge of the attack of steps from the move to the Real Madrid club from Manchester United and this summer, bought him in 100 million euros in the celebrated Italian club Juve.
Brexit: Great Britain will regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
Great Britain “will regret forever” if after Brexit loses its status of the world leader in the manufacture of cars, the secretary for Greg Clark has stated.
He added that it was "restraining" that the Toyota UK car told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in the Burnaston race, near Derby.
"The agreement is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese car stated that the impact of the delay on the borders in case the Brexite agreement is not concluded, it could cost jobs.
In the Burnaston race, where Auris and Avensis of Toyota marks were manufactured – nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would note the stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnastone.
Other cars, including Honda's cars, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in Great Britain, spread fear of leaving the EU without agreement with regard to the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW states that he will close his race for the manufacture of cars of Mini in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what producers call for risks for the supplier chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operating on the basis of the supply of “right in time”, while parts from suppliers in Great Britain and the EU are supplied for cars produced for the order within 37 minutes.
If Britain leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a disruption on the border, which, according to the sector, would lead to delay and lack of replacement.
For the company Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in the Derbyshire race, the company said, and this would result in the suspension of production.
Mr. Clark stated that Theresy May's plans for the restoration of future relations with the EU are "precisely calibrated in order to avoid these border checks".
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best business that will allow, as I say, not only current success but also the understanding of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence from Toyota is also from other producers that we must be absolutely able to continue with what is a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was not able to say how long the production would be stopped, but in a long term, warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the race and would eventually have been compensated for jobs.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has been working in the Burnaston race for 24 years and is the chairman of the racing committees, said that members of the committee organisation are increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these places disappear, they will never return.
The speaker of the government declared: "We have set up a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, states White House
The meeting of Donald Trump at the high level with the representative attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “other week away” because he continues to fight for the post of the highest judge with Brett Kavanaugh, told the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is looking at the work of a special Council Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian elections, the link between Trump's branches and Russia and the possible legal obstruction by the President.
If Trump releases a representative of the general authority and threaten Mueller's independence, Washington's knocks will be satisfied for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the carrying of a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of meeting the president through the 25th supplement.
Rosenstein denied the message.
However, last Monday, he came to the White House surrounded by reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump declared that Rosenstein would not be “willing ” but then a meeting was delayed to discontinue hearing at the Senate Court Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual distress, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate a weekly charge against Kavanaugh, and the full vote of the Senate was delayed again.
Trump's press speaker, Sarah Sanders, showed up on the Fox Channel on Sunday.
She answered a question to the meeting with Rosenstein: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, perhaps it will be necessary to move for another week, taking into account all the other things in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I will always communicate the current information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders did not organize a press conference with the White House since September 10th.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders stated that too few press conferences were not caused by an avert to the "diversity" of television journalists, even though she said, "I disagree with the fact that they're coming out."
It subsequently suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press will grow.
"The President organizes more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without giving evidence. "We looked at those numbers."
The conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press representatives were able to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying and you've seen that we've been doing this in the last few weeks and a press conference will be held, where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with high representatives visiting.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre views before the gathered journalists.
The Ministry of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland to not be afraid of Brexita
She wrote to the Ministry of Health to EU employees who work in the Scotland NHS to express their gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman's SME sent a letter, not six months before leaving the EU.
The Scotland government has already committed to fixing costs on requests for the status of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “In summer, they continue negotiations between Great Britain and the EU on the departure and are heading towards the expected decision this autumn.
However, the British government also takes steps under preparation for a possible derogation scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reconsider you how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and outside of it, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to patients and communities to which we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our hot wish is to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is running an emergency surgery after head injury
The expelled defense of Tigers from Tennessee Christion Abercrombie took an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury on Saturday defeat 31-27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ from Tennessee.
The Chief Coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told the reporters that the injury happened shortly before half time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Coaches and doctors gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line and then put him on their noses and prepared for another assessment.
The Tennessee state officer told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie took a surgery in Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no "no details of type/dimension of injury" yet and that Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second in the red shirt, graduates from the first season for Tennessee after the transfer from Illinois.
Before the game was finished on Saturday, he had five total operations, which means a total of 18 seasonal operations.
Foreign customers will be charged with higher property tax in purchase of real estate in Great Britain
Foreign buyer will be charged with higher real estate tax when he buys real estate in Great Britain, while additional money will be used to help homeless within the new Tory plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corby's move, which aims to attract young voters
Increased taxes from real estate will be paid for persons who do not pay taxes in Great Britain
Increased state treasure by 120 million £ per year – for helping people without home
Buyers from abroad will pay higher tax from the purchase of real estate when they buy real estate in Great Britain, while additional money will be used to help people without home, tells Theresa May today.
This act will be viewed as an attempt to neutralize the success of drawing Jeremy Corbyn to attract young voters with a promise to provide price-available accommodation and focus on people with high income.
Increasing tax from the purchase of real estate will concern individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Great Britain, while the money will further strengthen the government's efforts to fight sleep without a roof above its head.
The supplementary supplementary to the current duty of the purchase tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago in other homes and purchases for rental purposes, may reach up to three percent.
It is expected to increase up to 120 million £ per year in the treasure.
The estimates say that new estate in London buys 13 percent of citizens who are not residents of Great Britain, which extorts prices and disappoints those who buy for the first time, to get to the ladder home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “the cities of ghosts” just because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new principles appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called after the reduction of the tax from the purchase of real estate to help more young people get their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping their property prices high by taking the land, but not using it, and insisted on Mrs. May to withdraw quotas from the price-available homes to repair the "non-favour" of homes in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a boundary of the proposed housing reforms, including the management of rents and the end of the "unconditional" immigration.
It also wants to increase the competence of the committees to build new homes.
Ms. Maya said: “Later I said that I wanted to devote my efforts to renew the British dream — that every new generation would have a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and create life.
However, it cannot be proper that it is easy for entities who do not live in Britain and for foreign companies so that they can buy houses as hardly working residents of Great Britain.
For many people, dreams of their own home are too far away and sleepless sleeping without a roof above their head is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Boss Sunderland Jack Ross states that he is his “the highest ambition” to become the manager of Scotland at a certain stage.
42-year-old Scot is looking forward to the challenge of renewal of the North-East Club, which currently stands in the third position in the First League, only three degrees below the top.
This summer, he went to the Stadium of Light after the last season brought St. Mirren back the Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B and it was," said Ross on the BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that's always something that brings me back.
But that's the opportunity that would only come if I was successful in the club management."
Ross' previouss were: Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former head of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel anxious about the consequences of such names in such a big club, when he refused to play prehere from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The success would then be questioned whether I could return this club to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get him back there, but I guess I'd feel successful only if I could get the club back there."
Ross is running a career for three years, before he was the assistant boss in Dumarton and spent 15 months as among Hearts Coaches.
Then he helped the Alloa club to recover from the descending to the third group and transformed St Mirren from the starting decline on the winning of the master title immediately in the next season.
And Ross says he feels much better now than ever in his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"They were probably real crossings," he recalls the time he took Alloa.
"I really believed that the leadership was the right thing for me, more than playing.
Sounds strange because I was good, making good money and enjoying reasonable heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There's a lot of things you have to go through a week.
I'm still going through stress and pressure on the job, but I just feel good in the leadership.
I always wanted to be the manager, and now I do it, I feel like I feel the most in my whole adult life."

The research found that a great time for the pinte is on Saturday at 17:30
The summer wave of Veder increased the revenue of British bedrooms facing difficulties, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The numbers show that the cabin and bar groups recorded the increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July – but the revenues of the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Consulting Company, who produced final reports, said: “Stable sunlight and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, when the visit of the bedroom increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The decline in the market of restaurants by 1.8% in June has yet been worsened in July.
The houses and bars that taught drinks have led to the strongest of the way the restaurants have worsened.
The houses whose main merchandises are from food also suffered by the sun, even though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
Among controlled values and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food by three per cent fell."
Paul Newman, analytical company of free-time activities and hospitality, said: “This results are the continuation of the trend that lasts since the end of April.
Weather and impact of significant social or sports actions are the biggest factors in the sale outside the domestic market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chains continue to fight, even though the annual sales reduction by 4.8 per cent will be particularly painful in light of the ongoing costs.
The long hot summer cannot be a worse time for food-faced business operators and time tells whether the lighter temperatures we have experienced in August will bring so much relief."
The total growth of sales in bedrooms and restaurants, including newly open, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowness in the presentation of the marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sales monitor for the British market, bars and restaurants collects and analyses data on performance from 47 operational groups with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, which is an industrial measure in the sector.
Every fifth child has a secret account in social networks that hide from his parents
Every fifth child — only 11 years old — has a secret account in social networks that hide from parents and teachers — shows research
Study between 20,000 high school students showed an increase in “fake instagram pages ”
Reports raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of the students indicated that they have “the main ” accounts that parents know
Every fifth child — only 11 years old — forms accounts in social networks that he hides from his parents.
A study among 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “fake instagram accounts ” on which photographs share.
The reports indicate the concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students indicated that they have a decorated “the main ” account that parents know, while they have a private account.
One mother who encountered her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website found that her teenager encourages others “to rape her. ”
The study carried out by the Digital Awareness Agency of the UK and the Association of Headmasters and Headmistress Conference (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40% of 11-18-year-old students have two profiles, while half acknowledging their own private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is anxious that he has so many teenagers of temptation to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “glass of athletes” in the Scottish athletic committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as an inexecutive director at the annual General Meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most appreciated light athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are in sports leadership like those who will benefit from its long-range experience at the international level in the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletic Community and we are sure that it will be significantly useful for the athletic in Scotland when he is a member of the committee," Beattie said.

He wrote on Twitter: “I made an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show me if I'd be healed or to what extent.
It is exhausting, but I have been fully healed, he has learned to walk again, and today I have exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
Milk sugar caused by comparison of mothers to cows shares opinions online
The company dealing with the production of sewages separated online opinions by advertising, comparing breastfeeding mothers to breast cows.
In the framework of the marketing of the “first quiet sealable inflammation in the world”, Envi produced a musical video with an excessive score showing the freedom that a new swimming carrier gives to the breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of shadow with cows to song with the text: "Yes, I understand, but you don't see any tail" and "If you didn't notice that I had no weight, there are my tits."
The congregation continues: “Pump, pump, I feed children, pump, pump, feed my sweet milk. ”
The advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, however, led to online controversial reactions.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and he had mixed reactions from those who saw it, and many of them claimed that it was putting light on the “horories ” of the milk industry.
“Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and be born to give milk, but their children are taken away a few days after their birth," said one of the comments.
Elvie sewing is discreetly placed on breast breast breasts (Elvia/mama)
Another comment: “Seems to be traumatic for mother and child.
But yes, why don't you use them for the ad on the breast pump for the mothers that they keep their children?"
Someone added: “The advertisement is completely out. ”
Even those who defended the advertisement appeared, and one woman admitted that the song was considered “infective. ”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have made the pump if I'd still chicken.
When I suck, I feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but it's a thing.
It's a brilliant product," one user wrote.
Others added: “It is a fun advertising focused on mothers who suck milk (optional at work or toilet) and feels like “cows. ”
It's not an advertisement that should commend or exploit the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they all dance with discreet suckers hidden under their chest.
The campaign concept is based on the note that a lot of women who suck milk says they feel like cows.
However, Elvia is completely silent, has no wire or swimming wire and is beautifully hiding in the breast of breasts, so she gives women the freedom of movement, the possibility of holding a child and even sucking walk.
Anne Balarin, a partner and ECD for mothers, added: “The Elvie seal is enough a revolutionary product to deserve a significant and provocative marketing.
By creating a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and cows, we wanted to point out the sucking of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing a fun and reliable incredible sense of freedom that the new sugar will ensure.
It's not the first time Elvie's seasoner got on an execution.
During the London week of fashion, one of the two mothers, Marta Jacobowski, who was currently using the product, appeared on the mole.
Thousands of children of migrants have quietly moved to the established camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant detainees detained has increased rapidly despite the fact that the monthly border crossing remained relatively unchanged, especially because the hard rhetoric and principles introduced by Trump administration have impaired the placement of children with an escort.
Most escorters were traditionally formed by immigrants without evidence fearing the threat of the possibility to stay in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the immigration and customs department, testified to the Congress that the agency arrested hundreds of people asking for an immigration status of the lonely minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous criminal records.
When 80 percent of those who are sponsors or members of the household are illegal in our country, and many of them are criminals.
So we continue to pursue them," said Mr. Albence.
According to asylum workers, representatives in the effort to faster process issues on children have introduced new rules that will require some of them to be brought before court within a month before detention, instead of earlier standard 60 days.
Many will appear by calling within the video conference instead of personally to declare their case a legal status for the immigration judge.
Those who do not have the right to help will be deported quickly.
The longer the baby is in custody, the more likely it will occur in anxiety or depression, which can lead to explosions of anger or escape attempts, claim asylum workers and report from the system in the past few months.
Attorneys claim that these concerns are increased in a larger device such as Tornillo, where the signs of the child suffering are more likely not seen, just because of the size of the device.
They added that displacement of children into a established camp without sufficient time of devoted emotional preparation or byeing with friends could cause a trauma with which many children are already fighting.
Syria announced that American, French and Turkish “occupational components” should be downloaded immediately
During the general meeting of the United Nations, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moul also called after the return of Syrian refugees home, even though the eighth year of war in the country is in progress.
The Moul, who also represents the Prime Minister, said that foreign forces in Syrian territory are illegally, under the cause of the fight against terrorism, and that “this will be charged accordingly. ”
"It must be given up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moul insisted that “the war against terrorism in Syria was almost over, ” and more than 360 000 people died since 2011 and millions of others lost their homes.
He said that Damaszek would continue “a fight in this holy battle until we get rid of all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and“ any illegally present aliens”.
The United States have some 2,000 units in Syria, which are primarily trained by Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting with President Bashar al-Assade and advising them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the territory of the war of a narrowed country.
When he issued refugees, Moul declared that the conditions of return for them were good and accused “some Western countries ” of“ spreading unracional concerns, ” which caused refugees not to return.
"We have contacted international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicize what should be a clean humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for Syria to recover until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protective zone in the last shelter Idlib has created an opportunity to move further in political discussions.
The Russian and Turkish agreement prevented the great attack of Syrian forces protected by Russia in a province where three million people live.
However, the Moul pointed out that the agreement had “disciplinated final terms” and expressed the hope that the military action would be focused on the Gihadists, including the Nusra Front warriors with imprisonment to Al-Qaeda, who would “be expelled”.
The Ambassador of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that the first meeting of the new committee consisting of the members of the government and the opposition to propose the post-constitution for Syria and the delivery of the road to elections will soon be held.
The Moul established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee with the words that the work of the panel should be limited to “control articles of the existing constitution” and issued warnings against the infringement.
Why Trump wins in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win in other elections in 2020, if many liberal observers, prosecution and scandals were likely not overcoming his presidential office.
In that case, it would certainly be “the most dramatic finals of the presidential period in history! ”
Until now, there are no signs of tiredness of the followers.
Since 2014, the monitoring of the main broadcasting time increased by 1.05 million per CNN and almost tripled by 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has a average monitoring of 2.4 million in the main broadcasting time, which is an increase of 1.7 million years ago according to Nelsen’s agency and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has increased cable television to 3.5 million watching main night reports.

Nell Scovell, an experienced author of the comedy and series “Just the Funny Parts: and a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking In the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
He remembers the taxi ride in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The driver told her she'd vote Trump.
Why?
"He said, 'Because he's funny with him," Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, a story that happens in Washington could pre-determine the future of Roe v. Wada, whether families of immigrants can reconnect and benefit from the global economy.
Delaying is a luxury that only the most privileged trackers can afford.
And yet it's about whether you're an informed citizen when you're watching a panel of experts who discuss how Bob Woodward uses "deep reservation" resources for his book "Fear," shores the skin jacket of Paul Manafort worth $15,000 (arrogance clothing" as Washington Post) and the consequences of the disgusting picture of Mr. Trump Storm Daniels's "anatomy".
By the way, I won't look at Super Maria again the same way.
"The part of what he does and what causes the reality show is that you are feeded by something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of Pawn Stars on the rotating C.F.L. Trump show, in which Kim Chong-Una appreciates it.

Money outside flows to the most tight domestic races of the medium-term election
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania district experiences the flow of finances through the reorganization of the congress districts generated by two holders of the office in the fight for the same chair.
This has recently led to the conversion of the Pittsburgh District by the district democratic Republican Conor Lamb – who won another district in the special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another owner of the office, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who presents the old 12th Pennsylvania district, which is strongly covered with the new 17.
After the Supreme Pennsylvania Court issued in January the opinion that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided for the Republicans, there were maps.
The race in the new 17th district launched a strong financial breakdown between the financial branches of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after close victory in tracked March special elections to the 18th Congress District.
This chair has been captured by the Republican for over decades and Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
The politics experts give democrats a mild focus.
America considers convictioning Salvador for China's support, then retreats
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing under a mild pressure of Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with President Panamy Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and was accommodated in a hotel in Panama until the partners had legally moved the organizational team of Trump's leadership.
The representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to revoke the US Directors of the Diplomatic Mission from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “new decisions not to recognise Thai-wan”, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Heather Nauert in the statement issued at the beginning of the month.
However, the penalties were considered only against Salvador, which received estimated 140 million USD of US aid in 2017, including the means to control drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial assistance and focus on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Mediterranean country and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
With continuing internal negotiations, North America and the Central American representatives postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity in relation to similar negotiations from the previous year, which was viewed as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
By half September, however, the front officials explained that they wanted to continue in negotiations and effectively complete any considerable penalties for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now entrusted with the resolution of the conference currently scheduled for half October, in the framework of the signal, which the administration for the negotiations has stated diplomats.
And three American ambassadors quietly returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without having any new unbreakable news from Washington.
Mr. Bolton, speaker of the White House, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American representatives, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources have been confirmed by an external analyst that is close to the government's executive and has also spoken under the condition of anonymity.
Study History
A definitive coffin to the coffin could be the report of Robert Mueller from the Special Commission on the possible defence of Mr Trump in the exercise of the law, which is now in public records a lot of evidence.
Mr. Mueller, in his investigation, is allegedly referring to whether Mr Trump's campaign had a secret agreement with Russia on the attack on our elections.
If there was an exchange of parties in the Congress, Mr Trump would have to report to responsibility before this body, as it is preparing to regain before the voters, and would eventually be expected by the jury composed of his colleagues.
This is a whole series of "if" and I don't want to say that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable -- as well as in similar politics in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the suffering will take.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to arrange a push against Hitler, just to build up and support the Western powers in Mnich Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid long years full of bloodshed that followed.
History is around such critical moments that accelerate or slow down the inconvenient course of democracy.
The Americans are now standing before several similar critical moments.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, here is the man who runs the destiny of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's been pushing it from the time the report announced that he proposed to record the president secretly last year and speculate that he wasn't in a state of health so he could represent the presidential office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times' versions are inaccurate.
"How do we react if the new investigation requested by F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or what if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite a convincing charge of sexual attack and false deposition?
And what's most important, we're going to vote in the middle of the functioning period to the Congress that will be responsible for Mr Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will be waiting for a long dark night.
But I believe we can't, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew whom he deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once occupied my Ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to burn candles on the table with a swastique.
How can I not be optimistic about our future with such heritage?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about the conflict with Rapid Vienna
Rapid Vienna is aware of Thursday that victory over the Rakunani would give them great hope for the progress of the Group of the European League.
The wounding of the knee prevented Graham Dorrans from showing his first appearance in the season until the 2-2 remise with Villarreal. However, they believe that the Rangers can use the result as a reflective bridge for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team," said 31-year-old player.
“We went to a fight with faith that we could scratch something, and we took a point.
Maybe we could have reproduced it at the end, but the remise was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half of time, but in the second, we were better and we were better.
It'll be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be hard, because in the last match, they played a good result.
Last year, it was pretty hard with all my wounds and changes in the club, but now I feel very good about it.
The team's strong, and the boys really enjoy it, the training is fine, too.
Hopefully we're going to do it now, we'll throw past season behind our head and we'll be successful."
Women are worried about retirement savings
Although the participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people had spoken about it with family members.
Approximately half of the public studies declared that they discussed the cost of long-term care with her partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not decide to discuss it," explains Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the whole State life insurance.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care unless you advance your desires to them.
Together with your advisor and your family, discuss where and how to take care, because these factors can play a great role in determining the price.
Call your financial advisor: The advisor can help you find a way to refund these expenditures.
For example, long-term care can be financed by traditional insurance for long-term care, hybrid cash insurance that will help you pay these expenditure, or by your own insurance using your own funds – as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Stop legal battles as long as you can.
Determine your healthcare representatives, which will be a trusted person to surveillance your medical care and ensure that your doctors respect your desires if you are not able to communicate yourself.
Also consider writing full of power for your finances.
You choose a confidential person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not eligible to do so.
Do not forget small details: Imagine that your old parent needs medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Please write these details into the written plan to be prepared.
“The game is not just finances, but, for example, what are the doctors' names?" Martin says.
"Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have a plan prepared by your hand."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a strong earthquake and tsunami affected by the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to grow.
Since communication is out of operation, the subsidiary units could not get any information from the Donggala regent, which is a region north of the Palo, near the epicentre of the power of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palo after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palo and the Donggala Regentity, on the Sulawes Island:

The oldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested for the charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska governor and Vice-President candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for the charge of the attack.
According to the report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, a 29-year-old Palin living in Vasilla in Aljaska was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, breaching domestic violence reports and defending arrest.
When a woman tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Pala's phone took away.
Palin was sent to the Math-Su Pretrial Facility and is detained on an unsafe bond 500 USD, reporting KTUU.
According to the network report, he appeared in the court on Saturday, where he declared that he felt “decisively innocent ” when he was asked for a statement.
Palin faces three offences of class A, which means that he could be condemned until the year of abduction of freedom and to a penalty of up to 250 000 USD.
At the same time, he was accused of a class B offence punishing a single-day prison and a $2000 penalty.
It's not the first time Palin has to face a criminal notice.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palina.
The alleged attack on the police reported to his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently in front of the Alaska court for war veterans.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, infringement of domestic violence reporting and holding weapons under the influence of deceptive substances in connection with the incident.
He reportedly hit his girlfriend's face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by war veteran groups in 2016 when the violent behaviour of her son connected with posttraumatic stress disorder caused by the son's service in Iraq.

Federal Prosecutors require a special death penalty for a suspect of a terrorist attack in NYC
The Federal Prosecutors in New York request death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died – is an exceptional penalty that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly launched a cycle attack along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, using a rental truck Home Depot, which was destroyed by walkers and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, the applicants will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused a number of injuries – thus the conditions of the intention to grant death penalty under the document approved by the Court of Southern District of New York.
According to the judicial documents, both those figures would mean the possibility of a death penalty.
Several weeks after the federal jury attack, Saipov accused of 22 criminal acts, including charges for murder for extortion, which the federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, and charges for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “remarkable planning and preparation, ” claims the prosecutor and describes the way Saip's act was done as disgusting, cruel and cruel.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diega Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrena Drakea, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diega Mendoza and Alejandra Damian Pagnucca” is named in the intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York was last sentenced to death.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was accused of murdering two drug suppliers, but finally sentenced to lifelong imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was indeed executed in connection with the federal case in New York in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed by a couple who had been conspired to spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a relative from Uzbekistan, showed a minimum regret according to judicial documents during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he felt good about what he did.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by watching the videos of the Islamic State on the phone.
The police also announced that he also demanded the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He said he was innocent about 22 accusations.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “approximately disappointed ” by the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to require death penalty instead of accepting guilt and conviction for life without the possibility of release only extends the trauma of these events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
The Saipov defendant team has already asked the prosecutor not to demand death penalty.
According to Members of the Conservative Party, it should be authorised by negotiations on Brexit NIGEL FRAGE
During today's protest at the Conservative Party's conference, Nigel Farage has undertaken to mobilize the army of the people.'
The former leader of the United Kingdom's Party of Independence declared that politicians must "feel pressure" by the Eurosceptics – as one of the own Members of Theresy May should negotiate with the EU.
The Red Conservative Ambassador Peter Bone declared at a march in Birmingham that Great Britain would already be outside” if he was a secretary for Brexit Mr. Farage.
However, the problem that Mrs May faces in the reconciliation of her lines, where the deep diversion is prevailing, has also been emphasized by conservatives fighting for endurance in the EU who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain its compromise plan from Chequers under the attacks of the Brexit advocates, residents in the Union and the EU itself.
The unions insist that they will continue to seek agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and the ‘Chaos’.
Mr. Bone announced that the Leave Means Leave group would be gathered in Solihull where he wanted to “release on Chequers”.
He proposed Mr. Farage to become a representative and have responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was headed, we'd be out today," he said.
Ambassador Wellingborough added: "I'll stand for Brexit, but we need to drop on Chequers."
To show his opposition to the EU, he said, "We have not fought world wars to listen.
In our own country, we want to make our own laws.’
Mr. Bone rejected the proposal that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The thought that British citizens would change their views and wish to endure is totally expensive."
The conservative deputy of Brexita Andrea Jenkins, who also participated in the march, told the reporters: "I just say, Mrs. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is unfamiliar with the public, opposition will not vote for it and they do not like it by members of our party or our activists who currently fill the streets to be elected at all.
Forget Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp report for Mrs. May, she says, "The Ministers will keep their place when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage declared that the conservative policy must be ‘in an unpleasant situation’ if they wanted to betray their decisions adopted on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"It is now about trust between us - people - and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit and we are standing here today to tell them that we will not let you."
In the report of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political class, at the edge of betrayal Brexit, to feel pressure.
"Now we are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that has provided us a victory in the Brexite referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of the Great Britain that rules itself."
In the meantime, the Union residents went to Birmingham and then arranged two-hour meetings in the centre of the city.
Several activists had transparency to the Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend of the operation of this party.
The Labourist Ambassador Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives because of the security problems of the party after the start of the conference.
"This are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"The whole thing is a good thing.
There is nothing like a good Brexit,” he added.

Great price Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world master when the team director joined his victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas ended on Saturday qualification in front of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team director would play a great role in the race.
From the field position Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two turns he defended his position and called Vettel to attack a team partner.
Wettel went into the depth first and let Hamilton catch the cars circling on the whiskey of the group, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider ran into the depo a bike later and after his exit, he set himself behind Vettela. However, Hamilton went forward and in a close fight, the Ferrari rider had to unwillingly leave the inner trail free so that he could defend the double maneuver in the third scroll.
Max Verstappen left the back of the ride field and at the end of the first round he was on his 21st birthday in leadership.
Then he led a large part of the race because he held the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and could take Kim Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the depo in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight wheels, he couldn't increase the rate, and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he was acting like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and the first two places are rewards," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday Meeting because she insisted not to publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford with the charge of a candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual attack.
During the meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the statement made by Ford before the Senate Court Commission, and instead declared that what is going on in the Senate showed that people were “the wicked and disgusting and lying. ”
"One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that happens the last days in the Senary, when you see that anger, when you see those people as angry and wicked and disgusting and lying," he said.
"When you look at publications and publications and they say to you, "Ah, I did not.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you get away?
Remember her answer... you published the document -- ah, ah, what?
Oh, no.
She hasn't published."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... no, no," he added and imitated the senator.
Feinstein sent a Ford letter with details of the charge against Kavanaugh in July and information escaped at the beginning of September – but Feinstein refused to escape from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's orders, nor have I published information about the case," said Klomisia Feinstein, as The Hill informed.
"She asked me to keep everything in secret, and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, the president, who expressed himself to the meeting on Saturday night, did not believe her words, according to everything, believed: “I will tell you that this is a really bad speech of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway, it's the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The President continues to defend a candidate at the Supreme Court of Justice, who was accused of sexual distress, and indicated that the Democrats use this charge to their own goals.
“They are determined to take power back by any available means.
You see the suckership, the disgustingness, they don't care who they're hurting, whom they have to be trapped into the country to get back to power and to the wheel," Mediaite quoted the president's words.

The analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The Prosecution concluded its speech on Saturday in this case where a man is repeatedly judged by the burning of a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The Ministry of Justice of the United States witnessed Paul Rowlett's analyst for several hours and provided expert reviews in the intelligence analysis.
The jury analyst planned a scenario using the phone records from 29 of Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers of the night she died.

Another black girl?
The New York raiser sued a couple for his dismissal after the “racist” text report
A newyorka is suing a couple for her discriminatory dismissal after she received the wrongly sent text message from her mother, in which she was marked as “the next black ” text report.
A couple refused to be racists and compared the lawsuit I “extortion. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed the shock when the first day of work in 2016 found out that the new teacher of her children, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NEEEEEEEE, THE FOLLOW,” she wrote. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the text report.
However, instead of sending her to her husband she sent her two times.
When she understood her faux passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman, “concerned”, fired Mrs. Maurice and said that her departure of the Afro-American teenager, she was working really badly and she was expecting the Philippine instead, said New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a pay for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple of compensation for dismissal and requests compensation of 350 USD per day of six-month engagement, for which she was hired at the beginning, even though without a contract.
"I want to show them that this is not done," the Post newspaper said this Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
However, the two men regained their racist impact, but that the termination of Mrs. Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure because they were afraid that they could no longer trust her after that insult.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists," said her husband, Joel Plasco list Post.
"But would you trust your child in the hands of someone you were acting roughly to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco compared the complaint to “extortion ” and stated that his wife only cared for two months of old child and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
"Would you drive someone like this?
This is not a nice thing at all," the investment banker said.
Even though the jury continues to continue, the jury in the social media was very quickly condemned to the couple for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of the Stories of Bear Paddington feared that readers were not identical with the speaking bear, showing the latest reports.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the acceptance of the book, said to the rapporteur: “It is difficult to get into the situation of someone who reads it for the first time, before the publication.
It's very fun to know now that we already know the great success of Bear Paddington."
She stated that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC, before he was inspired to write a child's book about a small bear bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, added the 60th anniversary of a book publication, which became a “sweet” point after his death last year.
To Paddington, described as “the very important member of her family, ” she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a silent man, he was never awkward," she said.
"But because Paddington was such a real figure for him, it was like you had a child who has achieved something you can really be proud of.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success with this view.
Even though it was just his creation and imagination, he always tried to make all the successes only to Paddington."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louise Pasteura 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that this is really bad and that she does not expect to get out of it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I had to call from Nada, where she told me she would die in another two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did it.
I said, "Tash, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medicinal products that the doctors gave her to keep her heart walking slowly lost their efficacy and left her body.
She died shortly after that, and it was like everything closed.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep it in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning by the loss of her daughter, entered the plane together with other passengers, without showing what difficult test she is currently going through.
“No one knew about it,” she said.
"I kept my head shut, all the time my faces were tears.
It's difficult to explain, but it was just during the flight when I felt exciting understanding for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The grieving women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones as a result of suicide are working together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending cards to the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can search for support.
The son of Tyler, Mrs. Davis, was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and took his life in 18 years of age.
"I don't want any other parents to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old in Lydney, said that her son was a talented young cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile was able to light every room."
Nevertheless, before his death, he left his work because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his cousin’s immovable body after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis says: “I am constantly afraid of the effect that it will have on his life. ”
Mrs. Davis suggested sheets, “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help and can talk to them even if they were friends.
Don't sit down, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is the older girlfriend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"Nothing he told me he felt on the bottom or depressed, at all," he explained.
“Since a few days before Christmas, we observed the change in his behavior.
It was the worst thing in Christmas, when the children opened gifts, and he didn't look at them, nothing."
She stated that her partner’s death was a huge trauma for them, but that it must gradually be done: “It can make a complete hole in the family.
It broke us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance of how the FBI starts its investigation.
"I thought we could get something that we actually asked -- an investigation at the limited time, with a limited range -- could bring a little unity into it," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee would fall apart because both parties would bury at the gained positions.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his republic supporters not want the FBI to initiate the investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The elections in the mid-electoral period are only five weeks away from us, on 6 November, and if the Republicans do badly, it will lead to their substantial weakness in their attempts to put the requested man to post at the highest court of this country.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobated with them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI compile their message?
The Senate will vote about it and there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which allowed Vice-President Mike Pence to break the remiss and confirm the Supreme Court.
Numbers of refugees from North Korea for Kim "fall"
The number of refugees from North to South Korea since the beginning of the government, Kim Chong-Una, has fallen down seven years ago, according to the South Korean legislator.
Byeong-seug Park, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, stated that the last year there were 1127 escapes – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park further stated that there were stricter checks on the borders between North Korea and China and higher rates required for smugglers on the borders.
Pchjongjang has not made any public statements.
A large majority of refugees from the North receives a offer for South Korean citizenship today.
Soul claims that since the end of Korean war in 1953 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them flee across China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross it than in a difficultly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Koreans.
China is looking at refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees and often forced to repatriate them.
Relations between North and South – which are still technically in war condition – have been significantly improved in recent months.
In this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pchjongjang for interviews that focused on the stopped denuclarisation negotiations.
This was the historic June meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Chong-Un in Singapore, where they agreed on large conditions of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong accused the United States of no progress in the issue of sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and there is no way we could unilaterally disarma ourselves," Mr Ri said in the speech before the UN Vale Meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court
The leader of the Democratic Minority, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and stated that it was inappropriate for service at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this note on Saturday interview at Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help myself, but if any woman ever showed this theater, they would call it "hysterical," Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh's fourth statement before the Senate Court Board.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all the charges that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both puberty aged.
During his introductory word, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and drowning at his family and his age at high school.
He also explicitly condemned democrats in the committee and stated that their accusations against it were “grotesk and coordinated attack” by organized liberals who were unable to pass through the loss of Hillary Clinton in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's statement proved to be unable to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was predominated against democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself by these statements and the way he was based on Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question whether she would have tried Kavanaugh's appeal in case of confirmation, even if the democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will tell you this -- if he does not tell the truth to Congress, he is not only eligible for work at the Supreme Court, but also in the court on which he is currently working," Pelosiová said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeal .
Pelosi added that as a democrat was concerned about the potential profits of Kavanaugh in the Court of Justice or Roe against Wade, because it was considered a conservative judge.
As part of the hearing of the previous confirmation of Kavanaugh, he avoided the answer to the question whether he would revert any decisions of the Supreme Court.
"There's no time for a hysterical, predicted person to come to court and expect us to just say, "Oh, that's lovely," said Pelosi.
And women have to rule it.
After the vocabulary, months and years of wrath, she was unable to get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “The woman who used to make a director somewhere helped me, and she told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she created a certain technique, which means that when she was angry and she began to cry, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I'm crying because I'm sad.
But I'm mad."
And so she went on.
And I think that's great."
The tears are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, partly because they are unacceptable.
One of my most alive memories comes from the first job where I worked in the office where men dominated, and I once expressed my inexplicit wrath with crying, but the elder, always a cold manager I always had a little fear, caught me in the neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never show them that you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to get you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a democratic congresswoman from Colorada, cooperated with Gary Hart at his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was captured at the unmarried affair on the Monkey Business ship and had to withdraw from the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not examine the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It was not a well-considered decision," she said to me with a smile after 30 years.
“The seven more candidates were running and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and Seven Patches."
Because at that time, the campaign has been running for a long time, it has not been able to keep up with acquisition of contributions, so it has committed itself not to go to the fight unless it gets on the contributions of 2 million USDs.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give 1000 USD to a man candidate would only give it 250 USD.
"Does she think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of appreciation to those who supported it, frustrating her with a system that bothered her to gain money and focusing on the voter rather than on delegates and from anger over sexism that she was totally angered.
"You might think I've crashed nervously," Mrs. Schroeder said about how the press reacted to it.
"And perhaps you would think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking what they might have written on my grave stone.
"Crying?"
Why can Chinese-American business war for Beijing be good
The introduction of the trade war between the United States and China was deaf, and even though the battle is not far from fighting, experts say that there is a long-term gap between countries.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, gave the first warning this year by giving Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most of the most important escalations, however, have seen the world’s light this week, when new tariffs for goods are reported for 200 billion USD (150 billion GBP), which is practically the taxation of half the trade exports from China to the United States.
Beijing reacted every time, the latest of the fifth to ten percent of the 60 billion imports of American goods.
China tried to repay the United States with the same coin and it is unlikely that the second largest economy of the world would kneel in the knee.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to the original railways, it would mean to retreat his demands, but publicly subjected to American requirements would be totally humiliating for Chinese President Si Jin-pching.
Even though experts think that if Peking could play his cards correctly, the U.S. trade war could positively support China in a long-term manner because it would reduce the mutual dependence of these two economies.
"The fact is that a rapid political decision to Washington or Peking could create economic conditions that would initiate economic rise in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have ever admitted," said Abigail Grace, a research collaborator, focusing on Asia in the thinking tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, states the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that she is ready to voluntary return of refugees and appeals to help rebuild the country devastate by more than seven years of war.
At the Voln Meeting, the UN Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moul said that the conditions in the country improved.
"The current situation in the territory is stable and safer through progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas of destroyed terrorists into normal state.
All the conditions for voluntary return of refugees who were forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism, as well as the unilateral economic measures focused on their daily life.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million inhabitants have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million inhabitants still live in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem stated that the Syrian regime welcomes any assistance in building the devastate country.
However, he emphasized that he would not accept the conditional aid or assistance from the countries sponsored by the rebels.
Europe responded clearly to the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The Euria team won in Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US team with the final score 16,5 to 10,5 at Le Golf National field on the border of trouble in France.
The U.S. has now lost the sixth part of the European soil, so it has not won Ryder Cupu in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached 14,5 points needed for the defeat of the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Mickelson, who was most of the tour, then burned the ball into the water at 3nd of 16 holes and left Francesco Molinarim's victory.
The Italian golf player then shined in all its rounds and became one of 4 players and reached the best result of 5-0-0 since the existing format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest assessment, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The highest estimated world player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who apparently graduated his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the best European player with 25.5 points gained for his career.
“I usually don't cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy I got a cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after the winning of Europe.
He gave a cup to his landlord John Ramp, who defeated the American legend of Tiger Woods on Sunday 2 and 1 in the single.
"I feel an incredible pride to beat Tiger Woods, but I grew up on watching this guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded his career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
The strange statistics of one of the best players of all times that won 14 largest titles, with which only Jack Nicklaus can be compared.
The US team struggled all weekend in trying to find a fairway, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed a top golf during the whole tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk, after the unsatisfactory results of his team, said: “I am proud of these boys, really fighting.
We really warmed Europe in the heart this morning.
We really couldn't do it.
I'm cutting my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We'll overcome and, in collaboration with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cupu committee, move forward.
I like those 12 boys, I'm glad I could make them a captain.
I really have to screw up.

Update on the red influenza: Concentrations are reduced in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report of the Commission of Florida Fish and Wildlife indicates a total decline in the concentrations of the red influenza in the area of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, flourishing water skeletons are now reported from the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this suggests a declined concentration.
The flowing water of the red fluid has about 130 miles of coast from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee.
The skeletons were observed about 10 miles from the coast in the Hillsborough district, but last week it was relatively smaller.
The redflow was also observed in the district of Pasco.
Last week, medium concentrations were reported at the coast or on the free sea in the Pinellas district. In the Hillsborough district, low to high concentrations were observed, lowest to highest concentrations in the region of Manatee, the lowest to highest concentrations at the coast or on the free sea in the area of Sarasota, the lowest to the middle concentration in the area of Charlotte, the lowest to the highest concentration in the coast or the free sea in the region of Lee and low concentrations in Collier.
Respiratory irritation continues to occur in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
The irritation of respiratory roads was not reported in Northwest Florida last week.
