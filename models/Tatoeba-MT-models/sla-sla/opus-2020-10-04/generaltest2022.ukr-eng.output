If there are no options, I still agree.
Thank you in advance.
In Herson, people went back to a meeting, and the Russians weren't able to squeeze.

Rather, the migrants were traditionally gathered to protest in the Freedom Square - near the ODA building and the fraud.

I need to look at the place and try where it hurts.
He wants to push on all my painful points now, he knows what.
But not for me, it has no effect anymore.
I didn't want to talk about him and his drama yesterday.
You can't close it in the bank, with no rain, if there's no rain to close.
So I just feel uncomfortable in my own body.
It's my classroom English.

Sasha wasn't at school today; I wrote to the teacher on the mail.
Hello I'm sick, so it's better to move our meeting next weekend, I'm sorry.
I know how to cook, mostly for a prescription, but I like to bake.
In Ukraine, it is traditional for the bowl, the barrels, the others.
I don't have my favorite food, I like to try different foods of different countries.
What kind of food you like, do you like cooking?
I want to be busy.
Exactly, there is a train, and there are no places
Sorry, we're a little late.

If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train:
Green: Mariopol is the heart of war, stops fighting — we will have weak positions
The President Vlodimir Greenski believes that fighting for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, by Mariopol, will define the course of war — and if the U.S.S.A. defeats there, the Russians can abandon the negotiations and reoccupi the participated areas.
The direct language is, "Mariopol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It fights, we fight, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They are (protecters of the city, the order.) - people who have dragged a large number of enemy on themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariopol, the stronger our position will be in the east state, in the (rayon) OOS, and if they are stronger, then the table of negotiations will be closer to us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, we may be looking forward to meeting.
Because then Russia will do all these steps that can lead to returning even to the cities we have now shared.
They can go to that.
Then our situation in negotiations will be weaker and perhaps not interested in the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we find out.
We believe in our result, in our victory..."
Details: Greensky also said that having negotiated after the torture of the Ukrainians is difficult, but "we should not lose the possibility of a diplomatic solution if we have them."
The right language is, "The people will take peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
In our terms, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something -- and I don't think any peace will satisfy them under any conditions.
But if we speak not emotionally, the war must end with peace, or the millions of victims.
And even where a million victims come to the end of the war.
Yes, we must fight — but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing, there's no people."
Good afternoon, do you still have rooms for the Czech course for adults from 7:00 on Tuesday?

In connection with the change in the estesis of the Ukraine literature, new ideas were needed to describe its new quality state.
The metaphorical area of the Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
The English poetical metaphor in modern literature allows to analyse postmodernist context as one where the metaphor plays the role of the axiological criterion

The diet requires the code
The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence Intelligence has published a list of Russian military officers involved in committing military crimes in Buch Kiev.
According to Ukrinform, the Department of Defence Intelligence of Ukraine reported in Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
GOUR MO Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 military officers of a separate Motor-Shooting Brigade that are directly involved in committing military crimes against the people of Ukraine in M. Buch," the report states.
The GUR MOU notes that all war criminals will be brought to justice for crimes against the peaceful population of Ukraine.
The list can be viewed by a link.
According to Ukrinform, Irping, Buch, Hostomel, and the entire Kyev area were released from Russian entrepreneurs.
In free cities and villages, mass murders are recorded by Russian military civilians.
On April 1, the head of the city of Butchi, Anatoli Fedoruk, reported that 280 people were buried in the brother’s graves.
The Prosecutor General Irina Venedictova stated that 410 bodies of the killed peaceful inhabitants were taken out of the Russian entrepreneurs of the Kyev area on April 3rd.
On 24 February, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, announced a full invasion to Ukraine.
Russian armies are shooting and destroying key infrastructure objects, massaged housing areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, reactive fire fire systems, balistic missiles, airbombs.
Good afternoon, I'm sorry, but I can't work for you, because I'm going to go to Canada soon.
There's regular names right behind the tile, and there's a slengy expression in the brackets used in the hour schedule.
I don't want to bother you.
I've been watching the weather forecast.
I don't need a brandy.
It's just a nice clothing at normal prices and a size.
We were at the railway station shop
Professions that offer. Is it possible without language knowledge?
It's important, if there's a tradition, I need to know how to prepare it.)
I thought a week later, but we've got a lot of cheese.
Tomorrow may be a bad connection on the road.
I appreciate every person’s experience, even if he is painful.
I believe that I have experienced from every situation for myself so that I can avoid repeating mistakes.
The directives are introduced in the form of numerated written supplements, which are part of this Regulation.
I'm sure it won't be a problem.
In Ukraine, many are celebrating the same week.
This depends on religion.
Is there a Greek Catholic or a Catholic man?
At first, you can try it for free.
Maybe you'll write us a paying algorithm, we'll pay.
We have the paper that children get at the end of the school year is a table, and they get witness when they are born and married.

I'm gonna try to make it, because I'm still in my office, signing documents.
Your wife's not mad that you're on the phone
In my daily prayers, I thank God and the Hospital for you.
Let them turn you around with their cover of love and warmth this night.
My heart belongs to you.
Do you mind if I come right after the war?
place, day and time will be clarified according to interests and opportunities
We promised that when you go to school, we'd bring you a surprise.
It would be great, I have the money for two months of rent, the area in Olomouca doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my friends are deeply shocked by the news of the beast abuse of civilian population north of Kiev.
The photographs of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?
And I'm not surprised, it's just what I've been waiting for.
I took my children and older parents out of Kiev to the second day of war.
Then a colleague with children, and only after that he returned to the capital of work.
Since 2014, the CEA has consistently helped, and I have no doubt that in the case of occupation, Kyev's pre-occupation would not save my family.
Because there was and I'm absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten Communo-KDBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it can't exist, it's built on terror.
In 1937, one of my grandfathers was shot in the city's prison.
A few years ago, a copy of the anticipated anticipation was removed in the C.A.P.A.: the whole thing is over a hundred pages ago, and the sentence of execution is very simple and more scary than that.
The accused was unwritten, denied his guilt.
The ethnic Poland, the Catholic, had five children, was free people, poor "one-way" path, never walked in the cords.
The fact that they lived on the coats and had a few cows was sufficient to condemn the crown and the meadow of minor children to be executed.
The parents didn’t even know about the funeral site.
Grandma said that nearly a hundred people were taken from the village then and killed all other than two who agreed to testify falsely.
There's a name of the Sharie whisperer in the penalty case.
Our former High Council speaker comes from the neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I would not be surprised if his relative was the KGBist informant.
The apple from the apple is nearly known to fall...
The ethnic Russians were the tribunal that had been executed by the villagers.
By analyzing the case of the patriarch, he was interested in various information resources.
There are beautiful (no sarcasm) information resources in Russia, such as "Beauty Barrack", which is a good reminder of the events of those years.
So in modern Russia, the NKVDs' descendants found ways to punish and destroy almost all who have seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found massive graves of victims of stelin repressions and publicly wrote murderers’ names — the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It's like the computer found the child's pornography files, she was put in jail, and she died there soon.
KGBists are still killing those trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the past century.
Then why are you suddenly surprised by their action now?
The most disgusting qualities of human nature are concentrated there.
The surface of the Millennium Ordinal Tradition was slavery and the Imperial Shovinism of the 16th to 19th century.
And then, over what came out, a beast genetic experiment was made by cutting intelligence during several waves of red terror.
Look at the semi-French movie "Chequest" in 1992, that's what it was.
So you saw my photo in the bath.
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from cough?
I'm sorry I don't have anyone to ask.
I still wanted to ask maybe you know where the kids went, because Gala can't know their marks
Lubosh, Igor asks if you're comfortable tomorrow?
We're very uncomfortable to bother you so much.
You help us so much, thank you!

But it's not necessarily, only if it is, and I'm very grateful to you, too.

As is also offered by the hatches in the BTR Boxer option for 1.2 billion euros.

I have to bring this all up.
On Monday 4.
4. 2022 the refugees from war in Ukraine may ask for humanitarian assistance at the new jobs of the Office of Work on the Prague market.
The branch office of No29 is designed to submit and process requests for assistance, so there is a translation.
Lydia was already taken to school, but we're going to go on Tuesday, and I told the teacher today.
I'm sitting, keeping ears on my ears, listening to music and thinking about you and the kids.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, love, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I feel like we're together, that we're a couple.
I'd say there'll be a lot of work to do after the war.
So I'm not afraid I can't find her there.
I can do a lot of things.
So I'm not afraid that I didn't get into any of them.
I just don't know what's going to happen with the apartment.
I need to take a surveillance for food license.
Please give me a tip tomorrow for five guests to prepare the apartment.
Fifth place I understand that in the TV room?
Laying down and scratching the couch?
Can we stay at you while Mrs. Margarita finds us a place?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one they've already used, but he's a worker, but he doesn't need it.
Write the Czech address, let's look at the map where this is from us.
I don't know how much space there is, so I can't plan anything with the furniture she finally wants to look at that apartment this week and then figure out what furniture I need.
I'm sorry I answered so long, the working day, it's hard to adapt
Is that enough yet?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I finally want to be with you, having this opportunity to hug you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell me how you feel.
There's already a bed and a bathtub here for the child, things found for the first time.
Don't forget that you promised to help me as soon as you can, but don't give me the last one.
I want to make a haircut called a hat.
Oleg's sick, he's coughing and cough, and she's better not take it with us so she can't get infected.
Only I'll be a little later -- somewhere at 8:00.
I don't want any misunderstanding with you.
Because I'm worried that everything is fine!
Because we haven't even talked about this with these excarsions!
I understand how important it is to you!
And for myself, I'm silent. It's just the top that I can't reach!
How do you feel today?
Hey, I'm sorry, I just woke up, I didn't sleep well.
Sorry to bother you.
I was upset that I and Colee had a bad translation of the test yesterday.
I'll ask whether Gregory Denisenka or maybe Jonasaka) to help me with the mathematical ideas.
Maybe I can be helpful to them.
If that's the possibility, I want to pull the mathematical terms on the weekend.
The geometry is hard at all, but we have to work with the Cole to make it unchanged.
Thank you for the test tasks
We too have a great hope for this.
And so she is very pleased with any gift
Jab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Yesterday at the 402 bus station, I met Ukraine, Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And yesterday night, thanking God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine where my heart felt mutuality.
The branch office of No29 is specially designed for the application and processing of aid applications
turns out I ordered a backup card
Don't, I'm just a man.
So she won't be scared that no one came.
I'm not going, I'm hot.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Seven months ago, in the Memorial Holocaust "Babin Yar" in Kiev, we honored 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of the Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the honour to speak after three heads of the states, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their way and life in a territorial integrity, a peaceful and safe Europe.
This is the foundation that we must protect -- that is also part of our responsibility related to our history."
If "the evil demons of the past appear today in a new clothing," he said, "then for us, Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight should last."
Today Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombs and kills thousands of peaceful inhabitants, hungers in the blocked cities and allows them to die from sickness.
Russian troops perform mass shootings by Ukrainians, even visually like the shootings in Baba’s yar.
For more than a month, the Germans see it in real time news.
Yes, Germany introduces sanctions, provides humanitarian assistance, and weapons that have not been imagined so long ago.
Germany draws away heavy weapons necessary to Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to speak against the swastique.
This means fighting all possible means against mass murders, genocide, war crimes, and malicious acts.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to overcome evil and to stop the malicious things that are happening in Ukraine.
One song to you at night
We agree, make a trip, and write when to be gathered.
Everyone was sick only Lydia didn't sick had a micron new species of covid.
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I use this penalty instead of punishment
Call for the delay of the documents.
The ticket cost me a leader of 2,000 Guineas
Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has stopped being a far-bearing perspective
Nine years ago, the Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were opposed to NATO entry and only 18% of the respondents were speaking "for".
After the Revolution of Highty, the escape of Victor Janukovic, the Crime Anexia and the beginning of the war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the advocates, on the contrary, increased.
After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukraine's sociologists recorded the record level of support for Ukraine's NATO introduction, more than 75% among the citizens of Ukraine.
Despite the support for Ukraine's accession to NATO and the aid that NATO is doing under war, there is now a lot of criticism on the Alliance and the memberships of the countries -- the undue delivery of weapons, the refusal of closing the sky, the non-interesting of Russia.
Furthermore, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to renounce the desire of membership in the Alliance because of the RF position, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable safe guarantees, including military.
In the new episode of the Damn Questions, together with the editor of the European Truth, we're talking about how it helped Ukraine Alliance since Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticised, and why the Alliance is criticised in vain, why our prospect of membership in NATO is close than ever in history and why safe guarantees discussed in negotiations with Russia can become another Budapest memorandum.
How do you think it's here?
I have a partner in my volt point that my statement is on consideration.
I gave it through this mobile supplement
There is no visa, we need to go to the center of the convention and find out how to do it, because it was formed in Poland, and there was no visas, but a pesel.
We're going to write to you!
Dennis went in a good mood today.
I agreed with a boy from Ukraine, who met yesterday, to meet at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
'Cause I don't like this, I'm missing for a long time.
In Ukraine, it is reported that the Czech Republic has sent T-72 tanks to Ukraine and fighting cars.
I'm going to leave my children alone waiting for 3-4 years and going home because I can't leave them anymore.
And take it for 6 or 7 years in the morning.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a sincere feeling for this man, but he did not very well, and I left him.
Some time later, he came back and asked me to forgive me.
I refused him.
After a while, he called that he had a heart surgery.
I asked him to talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I psychologically supported him for almost six months.
During this time, we had a lot of communication.
At that time, I had a parallel of work problems.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual help.
And I was wondering, maybe we really need to look at him differently.
And he offered me to marry, and two days later he died.
So God himself decided our destiny.
What does your marriage mean?
And he only speaks Czech
I wanted to say that I was able to find a place, and I'm very happy with it now I have where to live and where to be with my baby.
Did you have to mention me before?
) Because I helped to see children in the family.
Don't apologize, just write what sentences you don't understand.
I understand that the translator does not always translate the text correctly
I don't know how to talk to the doctor or should she give a paper?
The guests must have forgotten, I put it in my closet.
Maybe it's time for you to go to bed to work tomorrow.
Can anyone help, you need things for a woman's XS or S size, 165.A also for her daughters (8.10.12 years) Thank you.
I bought two packs in ice that time, and my mom bought two.
That's very nice of you, thank you.
You've made me feel good.
Okay, let's talk about something else, or I'm not asleep, I'm still sleeping and I'm dreaming of bombing...
God is never late, all his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me :)
I understand the price of unqualified work, and I understand that the job I had at home in Kiev I can't have here, and the money I've earned at home, I'm not getting here now.
But I can't do anything, because all the bad thoughts go in the head, so you have to do some kind of physical thing.
In the airport, documents are formed from 7:00 to 7:00 a.m., but at other times, you can just wait.
Volodimir returned at 4 a.m.
So we took them to our place.
We slept with Vika in the kitchen, and they were put in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job and go to the airport with them.
When you get it, write it and find out what's next...
I don't find a place anymore.
Sir, this is the invitation of the Ukrainian children to join high school.
Yeah, but I'm doing it hard.
Okay, write me when it's comfortable.
I'd like to get my kids in the gardens and school.
That's the way we planned.
I'm sorry, I really don't have any missed calls from Wednesday.
I offer work, bathroom cleaning, toilet, washing three windows, washing dust.
Works about 3-4 hours, 800 bucks one time, from Tuesday 19.04, from 14.00 p.m.
I hope I tell you we're all right.
Can I call you?
Or can you write a contact with your wife?
I'd like to ask what I can buy in the pharmacy.
I'd like some advice.
We have Hannah viewed as an indigenous type of name Ania
She was handed by her uncle from the house
They made an English version, added new partners
Let him know if you need anything.
Don't forget about me, please.
Are classes different on Monday and Wednesday?
You're doing so much for our family! we're all incredibly grateful to you.
To be in the pool, you need help
But that's my thought
My uncle gave her a roller from her house and a board for riding, and she was riding at home, so that's what she has.
I got up too at 9:00, and I'm just making breakfast right now.
I'm so embarrassed that you're hanging out with me on your weekend, and I hope I'm not too tired.
We want to tell you about the change in the apartment and put the documents on the card.
We're giving medical oxygen to all hospitals of our country.
And I forgot to tell you that tomorrow's going to be a breakfast.
One mother said that she would bake potatoes for children
He comes to you at a visit
Please tell me, do you have any approximate timetable for a month ahead, even if you want to understand what days?
I can't remember this schedule.
The Russian army threatens to hit Kyev: they say, "Don't do this before."
Conashenkov's direct language: "We see the attempts of diversions and the tasks of attacks by the Ukrainian troops on objects in RF.
If such cases last, the RF forces will strike in the decision-making centres, including in Kiev, which the Russian army used to keep away before."
The Russians have caused rocket attacks on Kiev since the first days of full-scale invasion of RF occupational forces to Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles hit by the Ukrainian PPO system fell on a multi-party house on the capital Poznians.
On February 26, the Russian missile hit a multi-fall in Valerie Lobanovski Aspect.
On March 1, the Russians hit a television on the Roadways near Babi’s yar, which resulted in five passages.
On March 2nd, the Ukrainian PPO systems hit the South railway station Russian missiles flying towards the building of the Ministry of Defence.
March 14, the fractures of a broken occupational missile broke the house and the trolejbus on the Korenovka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a housing mass in Vinograd, and one person died, and another 19 were injured, including four children.
March 21, Russian missiles totally destroyed modern Retroville Turks in Vinograd, resulting in at least four deaths.
Mayor Kyeva Vitalij Kličko declared that the inhabitants of the capital that were evacuated from the city were too early to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still cause missile strikes on Kiev, and there was a lot of mines and munitions in the capital.
The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence Intelligence Warned on April 12 that the Russians plan to first a series of terrorists in RF to accuse Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against civilians.
April 1, near Belgorod in Russia, the oilbase exploded, as if as a result of an air attack of the Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April, the local government of Belgorod stated that near the city, the “ukrainian bullets ” appeared to have fallen.
Apparently, the elites in Washington and Berlin are thrown into a cold sweat from the thought that the natovers would be beating Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Greenski does not speak to them as much as with their electorals and society in general.
By speaking in parliaments and in front of many thousands of crowds in the squares of the largest cities of Europe, the Ukrainian leader does something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Greenski does not convince European politicians to do anything for Ukraine; he convicts the European nations who choose those politicians.
And these talks, this fine collapse of strength, touchingness, and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
As long as the same Baiden is strongly against the closing of the sky, 70% of his companions already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels is against the speed of Ukraine’s introduction, this process is ongoing.
I understand you, so I don't want us to be a fraud.
The cost that you gather is better to give to people more demanding.
I can come to you and we'll decide where we are.
But the air's clean, it's plus.
It says I've got a tariff for two without the internet, and I asked you to make the Internet again.
I don't understand the terms of the tariff.
Do we have another room today, or, as usual, just go downstairs?
So I'm on my way, and you're on the train.
But I'm not gonna stop loving you, you're all for me.
This credit is a financial advisor.
So it takes a few days.
Katya asked for the Internet, can I give her the password?
I thought you and Milana didn't shoot each other.
Great then, my husband will drive me because he has a car from the building room where he works.
We are very happy and grateful that our Nika and your grandchildren are under your protection!
Thank you very much for the invitation!
We also hope that after war we can invite you to Ukraine!

One of these particles can be used for 2-3 days, but a clock can be flipped.
I am interested in architecture and color
I'm so glad you're all right.
It's probably at 16:20 a.m. the concert will start at 6:00 and then I'm free again.
And now I want to eat something sweet.
So I'll make some tea and I'll get some sugar.

Contact:---- I would like a letter that the Czechs can write to you through the translator, the text isn't coming here, they don't have a Ukrainian keyboard, and if they call, you don't make a deal.
You really don't want this prize?
It helps people to see what they are worth and what they have for it.
If you don't need a Pricelist, I won't put it.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I'll do it.
By the way, you didn't want to write to me today... something.
Don't worry, I'm not here to ask.
More specifically, today I ask only attention.
I have a lot to say today, so I ask you more patience.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, you go to work, you plan on shopping, vacation.
You have dreams.
You're going to buy this dress you saw yesterday at the store center.
Tomorrow night after work.
Your brain can't accept that.
He's screwed up for an old reality.
You're calling to work, find out whether to go to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
As long as something gets clear.
There's hope... it's not for long.
Now... they're getting arranged... something's going to happen.
The brain refuses to take...
I don't have anyone or anywhere.
I got $50 in my pocket.
Many of our leaders did not pay for our jobs.
Where am I supposed to go, who needs me, how can I provide children, where do I live?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything out of the house... you'd drive 1,000 miles.
You don't know how to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you dragged children all over Prague.
And what's next?
And from every scratch, we don't have that.
We have a choice to stay there and call the kids to danger or try to save here.
She was very pleased with the hearts and the things she had given when she came to school.
You should have called me when you came.
I'll text you on dinner.
Yes, I only believe in God and trust in my life
I don't have the power to do this anymore.
I thought you were in love with a Ukrainian girl and you don't have time to communicate.
I got it in the menu, even ordered
2. Would you be interested in sharing with your Czech neighbors, friends, community?
If so, what kind of kind.
Please send a visa or travel seal (red with date).
Without a visa for refugees, we cannot provide humanitarian assistance.
Mrs. Libush, did you pay for Yasley?
Because I can't understand.
You're doing us so much good...
We're in great debt to you... thank you!
Yeah, I understand that's very good.
Now I'll take you off the photo of the lady's card I'm learning English.
Well, what do you write tomorrow, meet me or not, maybe your plans will change...
Good morning. We've got enough tools. It'd be so good to know a man from Ukraine.
If you want, you can be with me after work.
Are you busy tomorrow?
What a general impression you have since the first week
Carina brought us a drug before yesterday, and we're drinking it.
I can work with lying sick and disabilities.
But you must indicate that I only speak Russian and Ukrainian.
I don't have that.
I can get you some salad for the laundry.
Because there's only an antibacterial hel.
I'm not sure, because I'm not really in the city. Better than half 12.
What services/activities do you think are needed/needed for older people?
I don't know because there's been not a message from the bank yet, and I didn't take the bank's cards yet and the kids removed the banking application that made me very sad.
Then please write to me when you're on the ride.
Today we have the joy - our city of Bucha has been released from the occupants, our troops have stopped.
There's an enemy cleaning - they're looking for Russians in the basement and apartments.
The whole city is minified, the demining work will begin.
And John would have looked if there was something to repair or do something else.
Maybe he'll be ashamed, I don't know.
Panass wants to stay at home, says he's tired of us and wants to be alone when we go somewhere without him.
We're gonna bake a man and do lessons.
These are small entrepreneurs who opened volunteer headquarters in their rooms and shops.
These are tractors who actually go to the field, because it's time to sow.
These are bus drivers who today agree to ride in humconvoys to temporaryly occupied territories to carry help and take people out of there.
These are heroic leaders who, without fear, go to the battle zone, calm down and help refugees in vagons, and in peace stations, help volunteers to load humanitarian cars.
These are the carriers who were standing on the Road of Lifetime during the first days of war and who patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are communicators that carry out waste under fire, repair water and electrical transmission lines to ensure that people are needed.
These are doctors and nurses, who, 24 hours a day, save people, not complaining, but volunteering in a free minute, gathering medicinal products on the front.
We've got soc in Ukraine when little leaves are cut off.
Can you please tell the little children-- what age do you mean?
My daughter's 8 years old, is that the age acceptable?
I'm looking for a house for us and my daughter for 3-4 days every day to come to Czech Republic and pass passports to Canada.
In Warsaw, there are very many people in the visa center and there's no online turn.
I wanted to come for one day, but it's far, it takes a long time on the train, it's gonna be hard for the child.
So I decided to search for a house in Prague or close to it.
No, we're fine.
Yesterday's Tools
But I can't change the password when I'm following the link, because it makes a mistake like this:
It's in a microwave, something burned there.
In Ukraine, the biggest bank operators are always in contact with clients 24 hours a day, and all of the questions are addressed operationally :)
No, I'll get used to new realities.
I'm not very pleased, and I want you to know that.
You can edit a letter, the most important thing is that it's true.
Yeah, television full of it.
We have already agreed for refrigerators to respond to some Czech boys at 13:00.

I appreciate the projects tonight. After dinner.
He's still asleep, he's crying a lot at night, lies a teeth.
I've been on the phone with all the people known for Lvov, and many people have died.
Czech Republic began to publish visas after March 22, in my mind.
Until then, they were putting images like that and then comparing these images to wiz
Foreign Electoral District of Ukraine (UK) is a electoral district, which combines the voters outside Ukraine's territory, and consists of boarding rooms in the embassy and consulates of Ukraine and accommodation on military bases abroad, [the vino 1] with the Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and the DDR of the Congo).[1] The role of the District Electoral Commission for the Foreign Election District is the Central Election Commission.
Only public votes are held in the foreign electoral district: elections of the President and the national deputies and all-uкраinian referendums.
There are no local elections in the VO.
They're at the station next to the mother and child's room
He says he doesn't know where to go.
Are you mad at me?
I'm going to remove the photo in the bathtub
I don't need money anymore, I borrowed a friend for a long time.
I wanted to say that I had already connected the Czech mobile number.
I didn't need another device, I went to the O2 operator and they made me an electronic SIM map that I connected to my phone, so I don't need another device.
I'm really uncomfortable, Sunday works, and I can't do it anymore.
You said you had a broken washing machine.
We don't have enough blankets, bowels, bowels. Children don't have pajamas and there's nothing to do with.
Good morning, I'm going to leave at 10 a.m..write the address again, there's a missing message.
I don't want to torture either you or myself, I'm going to kill myself with it somehow.
So that would be good, but I know there were no free places, and in principle, they're having all the lessons on schedule and learning pretty well.
Do you have a meatcuff to make a fertilizer?
All right, after Easter
Did your mom say you were hurt last night?
She can't tell them everything she wants, and she doesn't understand what they're saying (but yesterday she came with a beautiful mood after that shop.)
She went to school, too.
Today I saw Christine’s mother, but she didn't even say hello. (
Very tasty apples, what kind of thing is that?
The head of the Office of President Andrew Jermak told us that Russia is starting a "fake surgery" on the weapons we're handed by allies.
Hermak's direct language: "They understand that they lose war, they see their retirement, and they want to kill the weapons delivery by any means.
For example, one of the last fials is the destruction of Slovakia's C-300.
This information has already been reversed by the Prime Minister Edward Heager.
We know the Russian scenarios, and I'll call one of them.
They can launch fairies that Ukrainian soldiers bucimto surrender with allies' weapons, and they go massively to the arms of the Russian army.
I'd like to warn these violins right away.
Because weapons in the hands of the S.U.S.A.'s only sending an enemy to that world.
I'm sorry, I forgot to ask how much it's worth to cost the gardens in the moons, and will he work in the summer?
Everyone is given by strength.
There are a lot more sad stories, believe me.
So I had to survive such events to change.
In Thorra, God created a wicked beginning in man to change spiritually in the course of life, to make it better
This is your home, you can invite whoever you want.)
How do you find this lady in the social network tomorrow before we're going to the hospital?
He listened to his mother and didn't come with us

And I'll do everything I can to make you happy.
After what you wrote to me today, I'm happy.
I hope you meant that seriously.
I'm watching the announcement a lot is already busy. Now it's hard for us.
I'm sorry, I didn't fully understand the question.
Didn't you make a call today about a change in the mobile operator's tariff?
I'm sorry, but I can't trust anyone in this life.
Today I was offered a job for every day.
I'm sorry, but I already agreed to work there.
Thank you for responding, and I wish you to find a nice assistant.
Your father may have told us that there are Jehovah’s witnesses among us, but I do not confess to any religion.
However, she is baptized in the Orthodox Church.
I respect all the religions that are the foundation of love.
I read the Bible, Quran, and I began reading Tora.
I believe that there are no mediators between man and God.
You can also think about not putting a refrigerator at the door to the boys' room.
Thank you very much. You helped me.
We're looking for a keeper for usual housing here, in the village.
Proposal of 150 crowns/hour, another collaboration with them, date to agree with the lady.
I'm afraid of chemical care, could a doctor look at me?
I'm just worried about how we're gonna talk to you.

I went to my mother alone, where my sister and her friend were going to go, and Anastasia asked with them
Where's the good wig?
Good afternoon Victor approved this house just doesn't know how to help this master with the documents to get a pay from the state and say that with the furniture bank yet there's no furniture there.
But I'm very grateful for your hospitality in your seat.
We have doctors here too. Bye.
We've already cooked food at home, and we can't find the keys from the ceiling.
I'll take my underwear for the fifth guest, and the pillow and the clothing extra are in the apartment?
Yes, but as to contact the owners, there are no contacts, I need a long-term housing we work and we can pay, help if you can.
At the end of each description you have contact with the owner.
You can use this online translator from the English to the contrary.
Anyway, we're four on one bed in the room where you can't even take care of, thank you very much.
So, did you click on the links I sent you above?
Every one of them has a free housing offer, a description, contact with the owner, and a photo.
I can't contact just an e-mail, unfortunately, I don't have a living place closer to Czech Cromlow, we have a job in Czech Cromel, and now we live in Prague.
Then I'm not gonna help you.
Thank you for your help, we found our apartment, but we need a bed and a couch, maybe you can tell us where you can buy not expensively because the budget is weak, thank you very much.

When I wake up next to you.
I kiss you and I say, "Good morning, sweetheart, you look very beautiful."
Where can you buy a hat with the ears that move?
There's a lot of work to do today.
Are we not delaying you too much?
You don't have to take a note, do you?
It's enough for you to communicate with it, and I want to understand you.
I'll take a look and tell her
But it's good that you're all right, and it's not possible!
She's lying on the bed, Sashka decorates her balloons in the kitchen.
It's a very heavy cake, and the top of the eyebrows.
It says that it is a request for humanitarian assistance.
The application must be completed in the Office of the CHR.
And show this strict code.
I mean, I've made an online request, but the application is to go to the Office of Work.
I'm planning on Monday.
I was buying a room at the waterphone.
This day is very missing my Slovak.
Are you coming back tomorrow?
The child has a high temperature for a week and a dry cough.
How's your day today?
Have you been interested in how everything affects our brains, create new neuron links?
Forming habits?

We cleaned up the whole room and moved into the second.
The international community continues to express shock and insults after evidence that Russian forces have committed malicious acts against the peaceful population in Ukraine, while Moscow rejected these messages as “provocation”.
"The report of the murdered, raped and severely wounded Russian troops of the Ukrainian peaceful inhabitants are worth the conviction," Prime Minister of New Zealand Jasinda Ardern said to journalists in Wellington on April 4th.
"Russia should be responsible before the world for what they did," she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents "violence of international law".
The statements were reported after reports that hundreds of peaceful inhabitants were shot and thrown into brotherly graves or left on the streets in the Kyev, in Bucha by Russian troops who left this area for a few weeks after the occupation.
Photos that seemed to be pictured by the bodies of the victims of civilians with tied hands were shocked by many and led to calls to strengthen sanctions against Russia and criminal persecution of guilty.
France President Emmanuel Macron stated in the radio interview on April 4th that there were signs that Russian troops committed "military crimes" in Bucha.
"What happened in Buchi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Mr. Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be directed to Russian coal and oil exports.
Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez stated that Russian troops could go so far that they had "genocide" in Buch.
"We will do everything we can to make those who have committed these war crimes not be punished," said Sanchez in Madrid.
On a public television late April 3rd, the Russian ISS speaker Maria Zaharov rejected the accusations as “provocation”.
Without evidence, she stated that the United States and NATO “procured” images to discredit Russia.
"In this case, I think the fact that these statements have been made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials is no doubt about who's ordered this story," Zaharov said.
Rather, the Russian Minobrons also claimed that Butchi's picture was a “one of the other figures of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30th.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to gather together on April 4th to discuss what it called “provocation of the UK radicals” in Buch.
The Russian Investigation Committee published a statement on April 4th, in which he announced a “investigation” for the proliferation of “faithful information” by Ukraine on the actions of Russian troops in Buch.
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Greenski, spoke on April 3th, accusing Russian troops of committing the “genocide” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Buchi to see what their military did.
"I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are fulfilled," said Greensky in the videos, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a common responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shooting in the head," he said.
He stated that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and Russian military, should be responsible for the actions of the military in Ukraine.
"When we find people with arms tied behind and unheaded, I don't understand," he said about the scenes of the victims displaced in the streets of Buchi, the city of about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian Freedom Service, on April 2nd, saw civilians in the streets of a small city of the body.
Only in one place a correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists saw at least 21 people in the various places of Buchi.
The bodies of one group of nine people -- all in civil -- were divorced on the ground near the place that, according to locals, Russian forces used as a base.
The victims seemed to have been killed from a close distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities stated that the bodies of at least 410 peaceful inhabitants were found in the area of Kiev, which had been controlled by Russian troops by last week.
Thank you, everything is, we bought it on the list.
"Them were told, "Kiev's gone." "As the occupants were taking poor people to Russia and Belarus."
Russian invasion to Ukraine is accompanied by scary things: robbery, rape, murders, torture.
There is another item in this list that is far less information about — the transfer of local population to the territory of the enemy.
Approximately from the middle of March, Russian occupants evacuate Ukrainians from temporaryly occupied inhabited areas in their territory and Belarus, which the self - proclaimed President Lukašenko actually gave under the Russian military polygon.
The Ukrainian Truth found the Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same evacuation is going and whether there are ways to go back to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text have accepted voluntary evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from no way out.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintain contact with their family.
However, in view of the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were transported to Russia and Belarus under hard force.
Thus, in Melitopola, the Russians kidnapped the personnel of the second birth house, took out children without parents, including a 12 - year - old Miroslava, a daughter of the dead champion of Ukraine from the swimming of Joseph Zachepinsky.
Alexandr's family, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vale moved to Hostomel a few months before the war.
Alexandr had a job at the Antonov airport, located 2,5 miles away from the village.
The family was accommodated in a military city, although she was a civilian.
As true plastics, Dennis and Marina have gathered anxious bags in advance, but they have not evacuated in the morning of 24 February.
They didn’t have their car, and the city buses were no longer taken.
About 12 p.m. on February 24th, they saw helicopters with Latin letter V, followed by the first bullets.
One of them hit the next house.
Then the family came down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks until March 17th until the Russian soldiers took them to Belarus.
Some 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to ride.
"At 6th evening of February, on February 24th, there were people who spoken and not Russian and not Ukrainian.
They ask, "Who's there?" - I say yes.
They searched me, asked me who was in the basement, whether there were weapons.
All men were questioned if they were serving in the army.
Women were told, "We have come to protect you according to Ramzan Kadirov's instructions."
It was a Chechen OMON, not even army, young boys aged 25-35 years old.
They said, "Out in the war we were helped by the Ukraine, Sasho White (commanded by the Nationalist Movement of UNA-UNSO Viking, which was fighting on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechenic war -- UP), now we are here to help you."
On the third day, they asked what we missed.
We say that water, with it was a big problem.
They broke the store, took the goods out of there under "the Russians will take" and brought us six bottles.
There's still a video on the Internet where children thank Kadirov for food.
So that's when they robbed the store, they brought a sausage and said, "We understand it's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Ahmatovich."
No one wanted to speak especially, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child says, "You have seven days to give back our phones," they laughed.
They were still separated from the Russians.
They were saying that they were good, because they didn't want wars, the Ukrainians support and all good, "The path is a bastard, and the Cadirs, too, but we can't do anything, because there are our families."
And mostly, they didn't fight, but they were going to rob stores, to maroder.
The chickens were tied to one leg by a george tape, and the other was their white violet, and they called it a "supplement".
They arrived in Ukraine not prepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... when they were beaten on Booch, so they didn't take the killers, they asked us, "What, do you have an artillery?"
Furthermore, we were standing up by the troops — the Chechenians did not know each other; in the first days, they asked the passwords to identify their own or the stranger.
We had them until March 13th, and then the Russian OMON arrived, and the Omsante came after them.
They put 30-40 units of techniques between houses -- ours were always in it from the "Byracters."
But they came up and told us that the CAS was gone, but there's Azov, and they said, "Azov" like, a thousand hundred in Ukraine.
"The Kyeves have already surrendered" has advanced since the beginning of March.
One day, a Russian, or desant officer, or a representative of the FSB, said that there would be evacuation.
And we were listening to the radio -- it was about Buch, Hostomel, thinking maybe we were given a green corridor.
From the beginning, we handed our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe Rostov."
We're saying we don't want either there or there.
What they said, "Some regret the mentality of your children!"
As it worked, they pushed us into the basement and started shooting from under the house -- either the city, or the minomets.
And then it came back... the neighborhood houses just burned, some of them fell down.
There was a direct hit in our house on the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us to Belarus only, promised to transmit to the borders and to the Red Cross.
The part didn't go, saying that it was for the traitors of the country -- he said, "It's going to shoot you there, they'll sell you into the organs."
We were driven through Chernobyl, and on both sides there were burnings, broken techniques, although the whiteruses were telling us that the Russians were taking the technique right to them.
A lot of caponics, buried techniques and soldiers.
In the Belarusian space space, we passed improvised controls, many of whom were at all without documents because they burned.
We were placed in Red Cross tents, gave us tea.
And here we hear the shots, the missile is shooting, and it's a sign that Iskander worked on Kiev.
Although those from the Red Cross in Belarus said, "Oh, no, it's planes flying, turning around the border."
But we're from the aircraft, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into the bus and driven to the Chunky Sanatorium near Gomel.
His head, Wanger Vasil Stepanovic, came, saying, "Here I am, I'm a hohol, I'm from Montenegro.
But I understand that Putin and Lucashenk won't stop until those thiefs are beaten.
Poor people suffer!
And we have Lucašenko so good!
He will, as he says, be."
They were offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted.
The Sanatorium Administration told us, "You're already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least they were called) spread the disisinformation that men could not go to Poland.
Many believed in it and feared to leave Belarus.
However, we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents, the daughter had no foreign passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and the war began on Thursday.
In the Consultation of the Ukraine, we had nothing to do with it, and in Minsk, the station was told that without passports, no one would take anyone to the bus.
I'm going to say that we were very helpful by the Belarusian volunteers.
We were inhabited in Minsk, and the maintainer was served.
There was no power in the sanatoria.
Our second group, the migration representative said that you could live here at the maximum of a week and a half because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who wanted to take us to Warsaw.
When we walked near Mosir (approximately 50 miles from the Ukrainian border), we saw launching ballistic missiles across Ukraine: the rocket first explodes, lights beautifully and then extinguishes.
The people sitting on the bus in Mozir told them that the Russians were keeping shooting out of the polygons.
But I can say that the whiterusians don't want to fight at all.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us she would break a son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where where Minsk, do not believe at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful nation."
Their polygones are not considered used for Ukraine’s shootings.
In Poland there were friends who took us to Estonia.
Now we're going to login, decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, the Ukrainian flags are now sure as many as Estonian flags."
Marina lived in a military town in Hostomel with her brother's family, his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
In the morning of February 24, she called the nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening, they went to the basement of the nearby house.
Marina herself couldn’t come home, and in principle she couldn’t — no more house.
No one knew anything about evacuation.

On April 1, the head of the city of Butchi, Anatoli Fedoruk, reported a joyful message that the Ukrainian military forces released the city from Russian entrepreneurs.
The next day the occupants were thrown out of the entire Kyev area.
However, the joy that the Ukrainian would have felt at this time was dark and hatred, as it was known that at least 280 peaceful inhabitants had been shot in one butch.
They were killed just on the street, some were tied up their hands and shot in the back, part of the killers -- minors.
Murdered and torture marks found the age of Motigin Olgu Suhenko, her husband Igor and her son Alexandr, who were kidnapped on March 23th.
The bodies of Olga and Alexandra were in the brotherly grave, Igora, in the sewer.

President Vladimir Greenski stated that some weapons provided by Western partners were too late.
That's what he said in an interview with the Associated Press, which was published by the President's Office, "European Truth."
"All equipment, everything they're sending, for some types of equipment it's done too late.
So what if, for example, we talk about Mariopol when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From some countries' leaders, I see a 100-percent support, that's really true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you can see the price of these changes," said Greensky.
On the question, that's enough weapons Ukraine got to make a difference in the war, the president said, "No, not yet."
The president also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, there would be no war or she would have a different look.
"It would have been different, we'd have the arm of our neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there would still be no war," he added.

I want you to be with me, wake up next to you.
In general, it blows hard in a foreign country, and every day it gets more desired home.
Mrs. Agatha, if you need this photo, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make our lives here as best as possible.
I'll remember you all my life.
And I'll remember and smile
Thank you so much, Annie, you're still making a geolocation route in the phone so we can get there sooner.

"I tell her that "repair of television and radio" has been dragged through import details, and friends and familiars are warned that they don't struck out of it when they're calling."
"We've been hiding the whole month from the infusion of war.
So far, it's working.
However, in the Plumka (cat - UP) on the bowl and the back of the knot, it may be stressful, changing feed, and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are removed, but stress is not on me, unfortunately.
The bowl is not deaf, he hears both sirens and explosions."
Because Olga's hearing badly, and most of her time in her room, her grandmother lived in an incognito apartment with her.
And on April 1st, 93-year-old Oxan Polov first took arms into hand.
"33 days I lived with her in the apartment.
It was also hidden from the war, and the fact that I was next to it was formally as I always came for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend talked, I gave her a reception -- she listened to her four hours, then she sang two hours."
The radio was always near the bed.
Most of the time she spends in her room.
Hears bad, and it lets me be unseen to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, she was hiding in my room.
First, she was hidden from a receptor and a television.
And then I called everyone who's talking to her, that's 6-7 people.
I asked her to talk about anything but not about war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning and to the end.
It's April 17 - I'm cleaning 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I never thought about it once.
Hello, if we need more help tomorrow, we can come.

I understand you and I'm not complaining, but in my situation I'll be looking for here.

The British, who defended Mariopol in the S.S.O.L.L., says that he is ready to surrender in captivity to the Russians
The British, who serves the Mariopoly’s Mariopol armed troop brigade, told his friends and family that they would put their weapons in captivity to the Russian occupants.
Source: the Twitter page of Aidyn Aislin, a British who served in the SSU labs since 2018, the BBC with reference to Eislin's family and friends, Atlas News, with reference to the words of friend Eislin, who spoke to him.
In literally, Twitter Eislin, "We received a message from him, "We've been trying to protect Mariopol in the past 48 days, but we don't have a choice but to give it to Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank everyone, I hope the war will be over soon."
Details: Aisleen served in the 36th single Marine Marine Marine Marine Squad, which participated in Mariopol's defence operation.
AWC journalists contacted the mother of Anne Wood's military service, and she confirmed that on the phone her son told me they were planning to seem captive.
Brennan Phillips’s military friend also confirmed journalists that Icelin, in the last telephone conversation, told the plans of their capitulation unit.
He said that munitions and food had ended in the brigade.
The journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend who said that Eislin's unit was intending to surrender to Russian divisions so that they wouldn't go without weapons and bullets into the hands of so-called "caddiers".
The social networks also broadcasted the audio recording of the telephone conversation, where Eisleen seems to speak with her friend, a friend of America, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Ayslin said that they tried to get out of town in a civil clothing, but they failed.
The British earlier told him that in Instagram he was threatened by private military company Wagner.
Aislin was a social worker in Newark on Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he took part in the fight against terrorists of the so-called Islamic Power in Syria.
In 2018, he officially entered the CEA and made a oath.
Ashley’s friends and relatives were called Johnny, and in social networks he was more known as Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know you're in trouble, but I'd like to know whether we're together or not.
But it's not gonna be easy, you're gonna have to find it...
You offered to go with you, I agreed if everything was okay.
Thank you, as long as you don't, you've done so much for us, we're very grateful to you.

Climate is almost the same.
My family's fine. I have mom, three brothers and husbands left.
One brother at war in Mariupol, the second in Zaparizh, and the man from Kiev today was transferred to Harkov.
They're calling every day and they say it's all right, and whoever knows it, they're not gonna tell the truth anyway.
I wanted to see you, but I wanted to deal with some things.
I'll ask my husband in the morning if he'll be there tomorrow.
When you come home, please write to me, I would have to communicate with Daniel.
The major attackers for their losses in the battle have played full.
He was shot by the teacher of Dmiter Paulic, his unknown relative, a young man, Boris Alexien.
Their bodies were thrown into a “deep hole of washing, which was spilled in the earth. ”
“ There was some dead silence in the city ” behind the memories.
Some of the inhabitants rarely flew from house to house.
On the streets, the bodies that were bothered by the arrays
I can't go after you, I need you, I can't do it without you.

Then, when the bowl gets cold, and the cake fits, and we burn it on a small light on the oil.
Okay, I'll definitely ask him.
As soon as we get set up tomorrow night, I'll call him on Tuesday.
I want to be able to thank everyone who helped us because it was the last hope, the truth.
I am not afraid of work, as I was living in the village, so I can and I like to work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
It's very interesting for you to have a tradition. We're going like that for Christmas.
Last week, the Supreme Council adopted a draft law 7176, which is entitled "About monitoring the potential threats to national security of Ukraine in the economy."
It's surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to national security of Ukraine in the economy has proved to be... the place for which members of the supervisory Council hold and hold banks are meeting.
The legislative initiatives believe that the decision taken by the Ombudsmanship Board in Kyev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We know about a large number of new dangers to hold firms, but we are not even aware of any company in which there was a need for a physical session of the supervisory Council at the location.
The potential threat of this law is understood -- it is a wonderful basis for "to endure" all the profits in the difficult reform of enterprises after the Revolution of the worthy, including independent supervisory councils, and then set up manual management.
Such as until 2015.
Why do they hold the supervisory advice, and who should join them?
Furthermore, if under patriotic voices "fly" one harmful bill, then the other can fly tomorrow -- for example, you can endure a public procurement system through ProZorro or NBU's independence.
Many things can be written for war.
By the way, this initiative has appeared before the war and the law of 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this rule was introduced to the comparative table of the 5397 law.
In general, the desire for the supervisory council has been circulating among some people’s elected for a long time.
Not because of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the law, we will consider the arguments that explained the need for acceptance.
And then we give our proposals to solve the issue of government management during the war.
The first deputy of the Economy Minister, Dennis Kudin, explained the need for this innovation by the risk of losing the Internet and other communications tools that would prevent the remote work of supervisory councils.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory council will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in conjunction with what a company can be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will he be able to prevent the movement of members of the supervisory council to Ukraine?
Imagine a cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory council (which are most of the composition) put their personal security above the company’s interests and refuse to come to Ukraine.
Then, according to the lawmaking, they can be released.
And then, it's probably going to lose the quarrel, the necessary supervisory council to make any decisions.
Instead, the appointment of new independent members of the supervisory council will not occur quickly because the law provides for the need for a competitive selection, which is in average three to four months.
Thus, the decision proposed by the draft law 7176 will probably not be able to save from losing the supervisory council’s possibilities to decide, but rather to do so!
The national deputy, the author of the law of Dmitro Nataluha, gives other arguments to support him.
In particular, he notes, "a lot of businesses, including the defence-industrial complex (OPC), now need a relocation," and so "it's hard to imagine that a person can, for example, discuss addresses and other sensitive information from Vienna to Zoom."
First, in Ukraine, there are almost no OPC firms with supervisory council.
The supervisory council is not in the Ucroboronprom, which is essentially managed by almost all OPC holdings.
But even in the Ucroboronprome, according to the legislation, the supervisory council has quite limited powers, and all its members carry out their responsibilities not a free basis.
The full power in the Ucroboronorrome belongs to the Director-General, who will, by the way, decide on the need for a relocation of an OPC company, which consists of a concrete component.
Furthermore, this argument does not endure criticism because the law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation governing the activities of OPC's enterprises.
Mr. Dmitro on his Facebook page also gives the arguments that can be applied to the "emotional" category.
These arguments usually have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of holding and holding banks, but let's try to figure out some of them, "respective foreign experts in the first word of war," leaving Ukraine in 2021, but they remain members of the supervisory council in Ukraine's state enterprises with a full salary in several hundred thousand bucks, while Ukraine itself is actually suffering from war."
First of all, it's manipulation -- most of these supervisory councils have never lived in Ukraine, and they have only arrived here periodically.
So to say they're leaving Ukraine, softly speaking, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavir pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of the supervisory council have long been engaged in online meetings.
This tool is long widespread in the world’s practice, and it is in absolutely different areas — business, education, medicine, etc.
Also, we should not forget that membership in the supervisory Council is not a full-time job.
These people usually have a different job, and they're just e-communicating tools to help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims only to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not express identical claims to members of the supervisory council that are Ukrainians?
They are not either at the location of their companies.
To say, this is not the first populist attempt to remove foreigners from supervisory councils, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Hello, I'm in Ukraine, looking for possible options for a temporary family shelter, with me two children.

Please tell me if Victor can help us with the refrigerator tomorrow? Because we can't carry it ourselves.
This week I could come on Wednesday, and next, I guess I could have done it on Thursday.
Yeah, I understand what to do.
I'll also be grateful if you tell me at the beginning to do everything as you need to.
We usually need a passport of one of the adults.
In the Browar, the High City, and the Buchan regions of the Kyev region, who were released from occupants, will take a strong command hour for 2 hours.
Pauluk’s direct language: “In the inhabited places of Brovar, High City and Buchan, which were under the Russian occupation and were released by the Ukrainian defence forces, the commanding hour has been strengthened!
In the area of these cities and villages, limitations will operate from 9:00 to April 2 until 06:00, 5 April."
Details: According to the head of the robbery, at this time it is categorically forbidden to stay on the streets of the inhabited places and in other public places, to move by transport and walk.
The inhabitants can only go out of the street when the alarm signal is called to move into hiding.
Such limitations are used to clean up the consequences of Russian aggression — cleaning and mining areas.
Omelanuk called on people who left these areas to keep away from returning home.
In the rest of the territory of Kievski, the commanding hour will last every day from 9:00 till 6:00 p.m.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

The Serbian defence budget has grown in geometry progress for several years.
Over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the update of military technology and the acquisition of modern systems, climbing 22 places in the list of the most powerful military forces in the world.
After the full aggression of RF against Ukraine, western countries took very seriously the prediction of possible aggression in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian and Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

If you're in Czech Republic without driver's permissions, you're forbidden to drive a car.
Other frequent questions about driving rights:
I have a driver’s license in Ukraine, can I manage it in Czech Republic?
However, if you are in Czech Republic for more than one year, you should exchange it in the municipality for a Czech driver’s license.
The term of drivership has ended, what do we do about it?
• The term of action that ended after 1.1.2022 remains real.
• The term of action ended until 1.1.2022 - is unrealistic, and you should make a test,
I have a real Ukrainian driver's license, and I want to exchange it in Czech:
• By staying in Czech Republic at least 185 days in the calendar year
• may be replaced in the municipality according to the place of residence.
I don't have a real driver's license, and I want a Czech:
• Necessary completion of school schools, examination of the control of the vehicle.
Ask us for the testing procedure.

Lucashenka’s regime forces detained three white - Russians 27 and 28 years of age, participating in the destruction of two relevance signal lockers under Osipovic, which provides the movement of railway trains.
Source: Radio Svoboda, Spring Protection Centre, Head of the Criminal Police of IMS, Gennadius Kazakevic, quoted by the Belta Info.
The IMS of Belarus was reported that at the night of March 30, for forced support, three inhabitants of Bobruysk were arrested, one was wounded.
According to the "Jasny," when the men were detained, they had active resistance and tried to escape.
Security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is at the medical facility.
Others were provided medical assistance at the site.
The Chief of the Criminal Police of the IMS, Belarus Genadius Kazakevic, stated that "terrorism acts on RB railway will be severely ceased" by forces using weapons.
On April 6th, the police were arrested by another colleague of Belarusian railway, the Baranovic Division of BGD, and the Administrator of the thematic resources "BGD" in the "VContactye" and "Monochroomers" of Valentine Samsauka.
Where it is now and where it is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March in Belarus, at least 40 railways were detained.
Reminds: The formation of BYpol, which is declared by Lukašenka's extremit regime, continues to call on white-rusians to make diversions on rail transport and Belarus's infrastructure within the victory plan.
Belarusian river partyzans are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As we know, through Belarus, RF is transferring to war, living power and technology to Ukraine.

United States prohibits investment in RF and sanctions against Putina's daughters
The United States, together with G7 and the EU, provide new sanctions against the daughters of President Putin, the largest banks of the RF Alpha Bank and Sberbank, and prohibit all new investments in Russia.
This is the report on the White House’s website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the biggest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets relating to the U.S. financial system and will prevent US citizens from dealing with them.
Furthermore, the States will have a full ban on new investments to RF.
For this purpose, President of the United States, Joe Byden, will sign a new order, which includes the ban on new investments in Russia by US citizens, regardless of their location.
"This step is based on more than 600 transnational companies' decision to leave Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large participants, financial institutions, as well as other providers of services such as legal and consulting companies,” states the statement of the White House.
The third step of new sanctions from the United States was limited against the large Russian state enterprises of critical sphere.
This will prohibit US citizens from operating with these organizations and freezing any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The detailed list of Minfin will be published on Thursday next day.
And the last part of the package is the full blocking of the assets of the full-year-old children of Putin, wife and daughters of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Lavrov and members of the Council of Security of Russia, including the exhibient and the Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, and Prime Minister Michael Misustin
The sanctions disconnect them from the US financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

Didn't write to you another person, Natalia 54 years. Please write the exact address and the cost of courses
I think you better make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I didn't change my name. It's one of my births.
I'm sorry I didn't see, I'll do it right now, and I'll send you.
We're going to the medical committee right now.
I mean, Anne needs to work this hour on another day.
What day is she better to come early? (Which day is a little more work?)
I'll listen to you tomorrow, the Internet is not working well.
You're lucky to do
Thank you... found something out of things, but the technique didn't...
Both beginners, except the alphabet, do not know anything
Nothing's going on.
Can I see you on Monday 25.04?
Kids can be taken with you, toys are enough :)
I guess about Daddy
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'm going to figure something out with the money.
We'll do it sometime.
But as it will be paid, please, no credits.
Write me straight, and I'll help.
We're your partner or I'm not your partner.
I don't know anymore.
You have to take the clothes that you gave?
It's not my day today. It's broken in the living room. It's one in the morning.
Something came from you, I don't see what
I'm also very sad.
Let me remind you of the invoice later.
You're the only one who talks and understands Russian?
What day does a colleague want to clean up the house and how many windows the house has?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't share with you.
I'm advising you to read Joe Dispense, he's doing research on the effects of external factors and forming new link neurons.
Natalie Nagorne television journalist released a video from the 36th marine troops from Mariopol in the morning of April 12th.
The military says that they had no weapons left to participate in battles, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said "the account goes for hours."
Before that, on April 11, 36th, a separate marine troop crew, participating in Mariopol's defence, issued a reference to the Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement stated that April 11 could be the last fight for Mariopol's defenders, and the Ukrainian military commander had not been contacted with the fighters for two weeks.
The social networks expressed the scepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Chief Commander of the Ukraine's Army Forces Valerius Fairly assured that the connection of commanding with the defence forces in Mariopol is, and the details of the defence operation should not be a matter of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the Ausstal factory in Mariopol and use chemical weapons against them.
At the evening of April 11, the Russian occupants dropped the poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariopol.
As said by the leader of Azawa, Andrew Belecki, the RF army used chemical weapons over the Ausstal factory, which are held by the fighters of the Azov Polk.
Thank you, I'll be handling you.
The same situation, so far we're staying here
2 hours of ride ) () walks, moms in shopping and back )
It's not important.
She forgot what she's gonna do here
The Czech drone squadry has launched flights over Ukraine from today.
Almost 50 professional copters will serve for discovery, and individuals will be directly destroyed by an enemy captain.
Two Zakarpatian and two Czech brothers “birds ” sent to Ukraine tomorrow, thanks to the deputation of the Mucacatov City Council, Volodimir Labutenka.
Today, they were delivered by Drones on the appointment by the inter-hore friends headed by the head of the village board and the coordinator of https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Basil Szczur: they were received by special units of the Ukrainian troops in various cities where fighting are currently in progress.
For the most effective and safe use of cotters, we'll leave their dislocation sites in secret right now.
Four friends who help the Czech army not to stop, say that in the nearest days, Ukraine will send many more interesting “gifts ” that will serve to destroy the Russian occupant and to save the lives of the Ukraine heroes.
I love the sweet, but I can do it without it.
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'm coming back to Ukraine soon, keep working.
If it's all right, I'll agree.
I'll try it myself, but if there's a breach I'll write you, if you can?
It is important to understand each other
We were personally at the elderly lady in the village in Job, she saw me and that I was pregnant but I said there was no housing.
Maybe she'll be happy, and she'll get up in the mood.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm still freezing out there today.
I've had drugs and tea, and I feel worse, but I'm not critical.
I am also sorry, but I'd better meet when I was healthy.
When you have time, give me the music you like.
I'm very intimate about what you're having musical suspensions.
Mom and Dad need to be obedient
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's cart.
Today, it was colder and rain, and it should be warm tomorrow.
But no pity for destroyed houses, a pity of people who are abused by occupants
In Herson, the occupants came from the Memorial of Slava Ukraine in Herson on the street of Kopa.
Details: The unknowns are noted that they destroyed the flag of the European Union, broke the panels with the photographs of the Sky hundred and the dead in the Russian and Ukrainian war.
The occupants destroyed the portraits of the Sky hundred heroes and the dead participants of the Russian and Ukrainian war.
They took the flag.
Good morning, thanks to the kids for Christmas, we don't have that custom so we didn't know whether the kids were just chocolate and cookies, maybe something else was needed to give.
In Czech, there's someone to talk if anything.
Because I live a guy in a group Until the twelve people will be here, and then they go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
He was already in the jasles today.
I've slept there even today.
So we have a great progress.
I'm sure I'll bring the cooks another time!
I don't have the power to do it.
Since I'm pushing away from days and time where there's a cleaning of apartments after visitors, I can say about April, because I already have an approximate schedule for the cleaning of apartments.
In May, I can say about the end of April or the beginning of May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hey, I'm sorry I haven't been cooking dinner for a long time, and I'm a little sleepy.
If you still mind, could I come today?
or I'll meet you after you arrived.)
He's humble, he's been learning a lot lately, and he realized that he needed it very much in his life.
(Hello) It went very well.
I was a little shocked that I worked with people in such a high position.
Today she had a lesson from a lady who is the director of the Economy Division.
She was very pleased with my work.
The mistake in the jasles was good.
On Monday, I have to bring a confirmation of work and a cash fee for yosles.
I'm lying on Friday
I don't do anything but much to them and to sleep (and drink a lot of water)
If they're going to the doctor tomorrow, I've gone with you, if you can.
I have to bring another analysis.
And you don't have to go again.
It's very bad to work with a powder, it's bad to wash, it's a master you need, you need to fix it.
That's all there is.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I'd like to send you a invitation to the Czech course you've entered.
And the children are feeded there, or should they be brought with them?
And now, for a moment, there's one question to you.
If You Need Help Write
If I'm not wrong, you're celebrating the Passover today, right?
From the very beginning, we didn't want you to gather money so that people wouldn't think we speculate about it!
But for online filling, there were not enough two points:
I'm going to lay down, get my strength and energy, thank you for today's gift.
That's a great idea, I'm going to watch the video, that's good, because the whole family's going to draw.
The University of Karazine encourages employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, hearings and rumors.
Just focus on official information.
That's how you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who remained in Ukraine, also helps the army
She collected some work for the portfolio.
After the holidays, they have to run the Internet.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
How I've been counted the day that I wasn't at work, there's a pass
Conclusion of headquarters: Russia is preparing provocation in Pridnistrove to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may be provoked in the Pridnestrove region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state.
Let's say, "The Russian Federation of Provocations in the Pridnestrove region of the Republic of Moldova is not exclusive to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create the next army grouping for action in the Liberian direction.
Probably in the nearest days, the occupants will try to restore the attack.
Furthermore, the enemy continues to prepare and send a personal composition, weapons, and techniques to participate in fighting activities in Ukraine.
Weapons and military techniques are being prepared in the position of the permanent dislocation of the 60th separate Motor-Arrow Brigade (Monastry) of the Fifth Universal Army of the Eastern Military District.
Probably the specified weapons will be transferred to the temporaryly occupied area of the Donatic area.
In addition, 29 of the General Army of the Eastern Military District is being held to renew the loss of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate Motor-Arrow Brigade (Borza, Zabaikal) of 29 the general army of the Eastern Military District.
The particular problem is that the enemy feels when the drivers and drivers are compiled.
The removal of the selected personal ingredient from the permanent dislocation point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Probably, in order to violate the delivery of goods to the fighting sites, it will continue to strike on transport infrastructure objects in Ukraine in order to destroy or withdraw them.
Determined forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks from the strengthening of the protection of the Ukrainian-Bilorus border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobodian direction, separate divisions from the sixth general army and the coastal troops of the northern fleet continue to partially block the Harkov city, the artillery fires of the city's separate areas.
In the Isuma direction, an air intelligence continues to identify the positions of Ukraine’s Armed Forces.
For that, the opponent uses the BPLA "Orlan-10".
With forces to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to invade in the inhabited areas of Longenki and Dmitrovek, failed and left his previous positions.
In the Finnish direction, the opponent continues to focus on the control of the inhabited areas of Popasna, Rubedne, Lower and Novobahmutka, as well as on the full control of the city of Mariopol.
The enemy tried to carry out a strike in the area of the Gold, and he had no success.
In the city of Mariopol, the occupants are continuing in the area of the Ausstalle and the marine port.
The forces of individual divisions had the enemy performed the artillery positions of the Ukrainian troops in the areas of the inhabited areas of High Pill, Trust and Marian.
There were four attacks of the enemy, five tanks destroyed, eight units armed, six units of car technology and eight opponents.
Didn't you understand your thoughts?
We'll usually try to make it, but I doubt it.
And how can you sleep, and I'll hold you down?
You sure you don't mind if I come here?
Maybe you just don't want to see you today, so tell me, I'll understand.
Thank you, we didn't watch television at home, even more than 1+1.
I'm just gonna turn on the television here to listen to Czech.
I'm running out of a month's pack of tariffs today.
Can we do this today on the phone?
Buy a tissue for sewing, canvas, threads to sew
I understand that I can prepare the material in this area.
I'll ask her, I'm a little ashamed to ask, she's giving us so much pies.
I'll meet my father later, I'm sure.
I've read the announcement in Facebook, that's probably Google wrote something in his own. I think the phone number is enough.
Good afternoon, we've got the things you brought, but are there things that we can get in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director's accommodation, I can start to go to work next week, because I'm going to go to the work office tomorrow by afternoon to file papers (if it's possible, because it's a very big turn) and on Saturday rain:
I'm looking for a brigade at the beginning, and it's a very nice chemistry school, I'm learning Czech to know perfectly, I want to work on Tevi.
Friends of old and not much, friends that I don't know personally, friends of spirit and mind.
Now you have come to a difficult time.
During the last month, I have communicated with many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from your feet to mind, like every Ukrainian person.
Many of you flee from Russia.
And many of you have admitted that they feel guilty and shame because of the actions of your country in relation to your neighbors.
Because they're subjected to Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you, activists, have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive strike.
At the beginning of March, I wrote to Alexandr Churchas, my very old friend from the Memorial.
So let me tell you a little later -- as usual, Sasha replied slightly. — Now, after the search, we're walking in ruins.
Others are acting cultures, artists, criticists, writers, are impressed by the sudden collapse of your slight world.
None of you like Putin and his thief and fascist regime, most of you hate them.
But let's be frank: except for very few of you -- those who worked in the Memorial, in the New newspaper, in the Echo of Moscow, in Meduga, the Naval organization and in a series of other places -- have many of you done anything to resist this regime?
Except for participating in mything when they're still in.
Also read the column of Russian journalist "Later to hide, late to silence"
And if so, are you sure that your feelings of shame and guilt are not just abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your lasting indifference to what is happening around, your apathy and your passive collaboration, which is now probably a great burden for your soul and heart?
It wasn't always.
In the 1990s there was a short period when you had freedom and democracy to a certain extent -- even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was not better than 1917.
Why is every time you finally have a revolution, you're finally covered by such a strong fear of grief that you're looking for salvation behind the king's back, let his name be Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you still think he's safer with him.
Indeed, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publicizing the KGB's archives, like the Germans from the stasy, you took the soul on the Derginsky monument -- and you let KGB lean down, update, transform, and take power over the country.
When you were set to choose between the country robbery and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the third option — and humblely reconciled with the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell down, which marked the end of the mass mittings for the great social justice or against the war in Chechnah.
The main concern of survival was the survival.
A young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Some of you have bought it, but you have voted for it either, or you prefer not to vote at all.
When he started to compare Chechnya with the earth again, most of you closed their eyes to it.
I remember well those years.
At that time, I worked in Chechnya, helping the victims of the pathinian antiterrorism surgery, and in my own eyes I saw the ruins of Gross, Katar-Yurta, Itum-Kal and other cities.
Sometimes on the weekend, I went back to Moscow and had fun with you, my friends.
We were drinking, dancing, and sometimes I was trying to tell you about the horrors I was witnessing: torture of peaceful people, the killing children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You told me, "Bred, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
In response, I was upset, "Moms, this isn't my Chechnia, it's your Chechnya.
This is your country, the hell, not mine.
I'm just a stupid stranger here.
This is your government bombing one of your cities, killing your companions."
But no, it was too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then the economic rise in the middle of zero, caused by growing oil prices and willingly viewed that part of the money stolen remains in the middle class pockets.
Many of you have become well - earned, some rich, and even the poorest of you have acquired a new home and have found a better job.
The prices have grown, but is it a trouble?
Moscow was celebrated and limped out of the shift.
When several opponents were killed — Yuri Chukochin, Anna Politkowska, Alexander Litvink, and others — — many of you were shocked and shocked about what happened.
Nevertheless, it did not continue.
When after two terms, Putin passed the post of President Medvedev, and you set the Prime Minister's seat, I see you were barely paying attention to that.
After a few months of the government of Medvedev Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored or silently silently.
How many of you have met in the next years on the mountain hills of Gudauri, in the Casbec, or in the Café, and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, until the part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we hardly have done a lot in the West if we're doing anything.
A little resentment, a little sanctions; but what was the meaning that Russia violently violates international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and internal market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the '90s, that was the most important thing.
But at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, have wake up.
When Putin once again exchanged places with Medvedov and planted the presidential chair as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went to massive protests.
The name of Naval became transparency, you didn't walk out of the streets for six months, and the regime eventually scaredly felt that it was losing the soil under your feet.
After that, he gave a hit in response.
At first, alternative action was organized, then more repetitive laws were adopted, and prisons were filled with humans.
Thousands were behind the nets.
Some have received huge terms.
"And what could we do?"
I've heard that so often, and I still hear it.
"The state is so strong, and we are so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by the Prosiyan president who deceived their European expectations, they once took Maidan — and never left him.
They built a tent and prepared for defensive defense.
When the police arrived and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with sticks, armatures, and Molotov cocktails.
Finally, the police opened fire.
But instead of running, the protesters went into an attack.
Many have died, but they have won.
The refugee became Janukovic, and the Ukraines returned democracy, the right to choose leaders themselves and to expel them if they do badly.
Midan didn’t like Putina much.
It was a bad example.
So, using the general confusion, he took Krim.
Some of you were opposed, but the benefits of this are little.
How many of you were excited!
As I know, 91 percent of the Russian citizens have supported the analogy.
From there suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his shake, suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to worship him.
I can find a reason, because we immediately stopped talking.
The rest of my friends were mostly silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been hiding in books, movies, catalogues of IKEA and parks, away as new after the restaurant started by the Mayor of Moscow in 2012 -- with their benbecks, their general whiffees and the hipster coffee.
Indeed, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's just getting better.
You barely noticed Syria.
There were terrorists, weren't they?
Even a Moscow editor who released my book about Syria then opened it in an interview, because I didn't understand anything about what's going on in Syria.
Well, at least I drove there and I saw snipers shooting my children in Homes' streets cold-bloodedly.
Among all Russian citizens there were only your soldiers who started bombing thousands of peaceful inhabitants in 2015 through experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Nimeller:
"They first came for socialists, but I spoke -- because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came for the sites, but I spoke because I'm not a member of the site.
Then they came to pick up the Jews, but I spoke because I'm not Jewish.
Then they came after me, but there was no one left to say anything in my protection."
How many of you spoke of Chechen, Syrians, or Ukraine?
Some of you did that.
But the majority spoke.
Some really speak now — such as Dmitro Gluchovski, Mihailo Shishkin, Mihailo Zigar, Maxim Osipov, and others.
Most of them are allowed to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ownnikov, risking getting into the new GULAG or putting up the Naval company.
As for others, you know the best country you live in.
So, I'm sure you understand that when Putin handles the Ukrainians -- or that seems very likely, if he doesn't, he'll take you.
For all of you, my friends, for the courageous, but mostly alone, the protests have yet been a small term, but soon he will get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social networks (i.e. even black square in Instagram) or spoke in private conversations with workmates.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of deprivation were given just for an anecdote, they were not in such a far past — and now they are, with great probability, waiting for you in the future.
Then who will speak for you?
The example of Ukrainians -- even more than 2014 -- scares the Patini regime: they prove that we can fight it.
And that intelligence, motivation and courage can stop him, whatever oppressive it is on paper.
Given everything, few people in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that war is at all.
But, my friends, you know what's going on right now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine that you support.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know what's going on.
Beautiful life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just homma, your laws, if not to take into account the repetitive, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media no more, your economy is ruining faster than I write, you don't have any credit cards to buy a plane on abroad, even if any flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence; he will require your consent, your humility.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try or go somehow, or you'll be smashed.
I doubt you can see another option.
Still, one remains.
Which will eventually disturb this regime.
And perhaps, in the conditions that are made, you will need less than you think.
Consider this.
The spark will not explode from you: because of the economic collapse that moves towards Russia, it will probably be burned in the province, in small cities.
When prices fly, and the wages will not be paid, those who voted for Putin all these years, because they wanted bread and peace, will come out on the street.
Putin knows this and fears these people more than he fears intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is you, my friends.
But if each city comes out on my own, as it has been, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
It will be necessary to organize and coordinate. The crowd will have to turn into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool -- the Internet that can limit, but it's still working, and it's going to be fixed nearly under any circumstances.
The Naval organization was broken, but you could create other, more informal, more decentralized.
A lot of you, millions of you.
Moscow police can handle 30,000 people in the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If it comes over 300 thousand, it's going to be amazed.
The army will have to use, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to the case?
After everything he made them in Ukraine, what did he make them go through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will feel a clear fear; but those who have children will fear for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
If I were you, I'd be afraid too.
In the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to ignore their owner, who dare not only to demand freedom but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in the chat of a computer game -- and he'll be arrested; your daughter will express annoyance on the Internet -- and she'll be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes -- and he'll die in a cheese cell under police clubs.
This is what's been happening for many years, and it's only going to grow up, getting more and more.
So you don't have a choice, if you don't do anything, you know what this is going to end.
Act coldly, think strategicly, and make it real.
We were on Friday at the classroom, we were told that we could come on Monday.
We'll be home by night
That you take me as a secretary
How often do you go to a expensive restaurant?
I'm going to a expensive restaurant for dinner once.
I'll try to explain everything to her.)
That's how we liked it very nice, and we wanted something blister, so it's a better option.
I was in a room where there were many people, and I was tired of energy.
I feel bad, cough, temperature, voice disappears, weakness and head turns
I have to go to that government of work
We've already done it, but we said who's registered in April will only get the money at the end of the month.
Thursday we need a leave, we go to the doctor with our children.
But at night, a lady who liked your work, and she wanted something from you in her house.
I'm expecting her new news, and I'm definitely gonna let her know.
When I worked in the prosecutor's office, I thought I was building a career, spent a lot of time and strength.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a pity of the lost time, but it's life experience.
In my personal life, I am communicable, but I have a serious attitude to deal with one’s love and marriage issues.
There was one man I had to marry, but he died, with heart problems.
I believe that people must love, respect, trust each other in order to create a family.
I haven't met one of these for now.
Good afternoon: Where can you buy forms in Yeglav to bake a strip (paper or silicone)?
All right, thank you for the advice, I'm going to bring a testimony to the Value.
She's got a DCP in bed, she's got a knife broken in a hypsy, a cart in her bed position, the whole food is erased in a blander.
Mr. Reichard, I'm sorry to bother you at the unemployed time.
But I have an important question for you.
I went into the game room today to Natalie, to say hello to her.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the kids were going home, one mother refused to take a baby because she said she came to look at things and put them in that room with clothes and Mr. Valerie opened our child room until 7:00 yesterday.
Is that really possible?
It's the working time of the room until 4:00 p.m.
And eventually it's our responsibility.
But I don't have a load to open a very weak internet.
Good afternoon, we're all fine. Cola works, the invitations filled yesterday, and I worked with the elders before the examination at high school.
It's the hardest thing to do with geometry.
On Saturday, Volodimir helped us.
Vika is studying universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We are very grateful for the Housing
Yeah, but I thought you didn't fill it.
We'll try to get the sum up by the end of the week to calculate
The situation on Russian invasion - briefing of the head of the Office of President Alexi Arestovic (10.04.2022)
The leader of the Office of the President told him about the heroic act of the Senior Army Officer in Mariupol -- he was surrounded and injured, so he exploded himself with the radio station so that she could not reach the opponent.
I have a very important question if I can help put my granddaughter on her 5 years (bronchal astma) now she's got a screw and a chryp...
We need a family doctor for her to understand a little Ukrainian or Russian.
The doctor’s consultation is urgently needed, and I am very concerned about her condition.
We live in Czech Republic Lower Chabry. We need a doctor who is both here in the Lower Chabri or somewhere near Brno but not far from the subway so we can reach.
The butterfly exhibition was very enjoyable.
Motels were sitting on their hands and feet.
How's your day?
I'm so grateful to you, no words, thank you very much.
Mother's been there since 4 in the morning
Perhaps the housekeeper will leave his phone for communication.
So far, it seems to me the best option of this house in Prague-8.
The director didn't tell me anything about the possibility of sponsoring the child's lunch.
They gave me those data to pay.
For the part of March and April, I have already paid for food.
If you had a chance to help me pay May and June?
What am I supposed to do?
You want me to talk to your school director with this question?
Walk on Monday or Better Wednesday?
All your friends will know you're talking to me.
I don't know what to do with my home soon, and there's no housing.
Did you get out of your relationship first or were you left?
They came from the Doncia, I have medical education, 27 years of internship, work in the neurological department, massage, health care for adults and children, loved medical manipulations.. I speak Russian and Ukrainian.. with the rest of the information call +420-464-548-072 or write on viber +380-42-791-0436
I was a manicure manique and a friend manager.
But we know everything, we know Ukraine, and what we don't know quickly, we learn.)))
I wish you could find a good assistant . .
I've thought you'd be late today.
Can I ask you to take them with me when you're going home?
I need a bowl, I can pay for the rent.
I don't know what to do.
We need to go to the embassy periodically, and I'm waiting for them to be able to reconstruct the documents, and I'm going to go.
Besides, I'm interested in talking to you.
