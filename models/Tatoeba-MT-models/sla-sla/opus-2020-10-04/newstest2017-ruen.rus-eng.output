Scientists found a animal that could live for 500 years
The International Biologist Group concluded that the longest spinal animal was a grenland-polar shark, which could live for about 500 years, transmitted by the RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the eye crustalic of 28 grenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is over five meters, may be between 272 and 512 years of age.
Biologists believe that the shark’s long-term role plays a low metabolism that leads to slow development.
The females of the Greenland sharks only reach gender maturity for 150 years.
It was previously believed that more than all spinal animals lived by the Shark's neighbour, a grenland whale.
The oldest speciality known by scientists was about 210 years old.
Putin changed the composition of Sobbez RF.

Should we go to the sanatorium if there is no health problem?
Our expert is the main doctor of Olga Bogos.
And if a person is healthy, he's just tired of working, should he go to the sanatorium?
We don't only need sanitation vacation for treatment but also for prevention of diseases.
In the circumstances of the sanatory, a person may verify the condition of his body and receive the doctor ' s recommendations to live so that his health should not be destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be excessive.
"I'm just tired of work" is the important signal of the body, and it should not be distracted.
Permanent stress, mental and physical exhaustion can lead to depression and chronic tired syndrome.
The stress is about 90 per cent of the arrivals.
He is most subjected to a larger city aged between 45 and 55.
So it's better not to complicate the situation and let yourself rest in time.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people are reducing their biological age during their stay in the sanatoria.
Modern sanatories offer comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to spend your holiday with your children, you don't have to break up with them.
For children, even the smallest, cure programmes include both diagnostic services, pediatric consultations, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatories are child pools), inhalation, special diet mode, massages, oxygen cocktails, physicians.
The course of procedures determines the doctor taking into account individual testimony and characteristics of the growing body.
Furthermore, the sanatories usually work with animators where children can attend game classes, different master classes.
Some sanatories open their doors even for infants, provide the necessary conditions for the baby and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
A soft winter, a long summer, produces good conditions for round-year rest in the Caucasian Mineral Water.
And then the body needs a rest not only in the summer.
So we should not be afraid of weather outside the window, even though most procedures are carried out in the room and are not dependent on the season.
In general, sanatorial curatorial treatment is desirable to be conducted twice a year, especially for adults.
The main fix of the Caucasian Mineral Water region, of course, the treatment mineral sources: Slavjanovski, Smirnovski, Estentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique characteristics and have an impact on different organism systems.
Water is different from the temperature, salt, overall mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks water depending on the patient's self-esteem.
Thus, Narzan has anti-fuel, immunomoduling, renewing the functions of the stomach and the exchange of substances.
The Esentuki-4 affects the stomach and sugar.
The essentics of the new is an anti-fuel, yellow and urinary action.
The same effect has the Slovenian water.
The physician must take into account the state of the heart-consuming system in the appointment of water.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks less salt water because salts delay the liquid, which leads to increased pressure.
Receipt of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drinked at a certain time, at the necessary quantity and specific temperature.
There are now various cosmetological procedures for the person and body in the sanatories.
What types of recovery based on the natural characteristics of the Northern Caucas can be obtained in the resorts of the region?
There is, for example, a salt lake of Tambucan, an illuminated dirt of which is useful for compounds, spine, internal organs.
It provides anti-fuel, sustaining, immunomodulating action.
These are healing walks on individually composed routes.
They are particularly popular in Kyslovodsk, where there is a huge Kurort Park (second large in Europe).
Popular in Kyslovodsk, which is close to Narzan mineral source.
There can also be baths of wine, biser, yo-ho, seasonal, salphino-lacritical, depending on what the doctor will appoint.
Prolong the fertility.
What do you want the harvest to go to the end of the season?
Tells Julia Belopuchov, agronom and cluster.
It is time for high-level tomatoes to make a haircut: to remove new pastures, cut the waxes, remove all leaves with fruit and small bonds, they will not be able to mature.
All tomatoes, regardless of the Constitution, as well as peppers and baklayed, feeding gold-super-phosphate exhaust, processing bio-preparations (Adolescent - to accelerate influenza and growth of fruit, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Bactofit - from disease, Immunocytophite - to increase immunities, Bitoxibacillin, Lepidocide, Fitoverm - if there are harmful).
Only copper copper, colloid cheese and green sauce should be used from chemicals at the end of summer.
We're doing the last floating of plants.
The long corn in the heat shall be dropped out of the walls so that the lower, shaved part of the tree (25-40 cm) will be lay on the ground, poured with warm water and circo's solvent, and we will put the steel to 5-7 cm composite.
Prolong the fertility of the cabbage is also not complicated: cut old leaves, spill with warm water and solvent of integrated weeds, put the fruitful soil under the mushroom.
For the protection of night colds, set above the arrow with a concealed material.
Keep the plant open in the day, and close the sun after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is out of the crisis?
Economists have seen the signs of Russia's exit from the last twenty years of recession.
According to the Bloomberg analysts, GDP of RF demonstrates a positive dynamic, which decreased by 0.8 per cent in the annual expression in the second quarter of GDP.
This indicator is minimum since the beginning of 2015.
According to Rost, the Russian economy decline in the second quarter slowed to 0.6 per cent.
The situation was recently stabilized by the Centrebank and the Mineeconomic Development.
There's slow growth ahead.
According to experts, the recession in the Russian economy remained past.
"The index assessment of the Russian GDP suggests that the recession remains behind and the slow growth of the economy ahead," said the Russian Bank's "What the Trends say."
GDP-based GDP assessment for the current quarter has increased to 0.4 per cent, estimated by the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
As the representative of the Mineconomic Development reported, during the second quarter the GDP decreased in the second quarter, with 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared GDP decline was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
However, during the quarter the decline stopped: it was 0.2 per cent in April, and the GDP change was between 0 and 0.15 in May and June," quoted the representative of RIA "News " .
The slowdown of the Russian economy falling during the last five blocks indicates that "one has passed."
Bloomberg, among other markers indicating the renewal of the national economy, calls for increased demand for electricity and railway transport, business recovery.
If an amendment to that year is high, it is clear that the dynamic in plus 1% of electricity consumption may be halfly caused by an additional working day.
Let's add a lower average temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of cargo transport, but it is difficult to get accurate data, and a plus a minus 0.5 per cent of the seasonal volume can also be explained," explains Cyril Jakovenko from ALOR BROCER.
There are, however, more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Furthermore, the last two weeks, Rosstat fixed the deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the drill course, which, although showed strong hesitations at the beginning of the year, since August the beginning of the year, increased by 12 per cent.
This is also one of the signs of recovery to be followed by indicators from the real economy," Jamesenko emphasized.
Furthermore, since April, the RF has increased industries.
In June, the rate increased by 1.7 per cent.
External trade rates are slowed from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The positive dynamic also shows the situation in the labour market where unemployment levels decreased to 5.4 per cent.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the healthy situation in the labour market, the issue with real income available to the population is to leave the best.
The annual expression decreases by 4.8 per cent.
This factor may stop the recovery of the economy, as the household costs contribute to GDP.
The economic structure usually exceeds 50 per cent of their shares.
In addition to low consumer activity, as factors of risk for economic growth can also be referred to as a strict policy of the Bank of Russia.
The regulator maintains a rate of 10.5 per cent, which does not affect the real sector well.
The negative factor is also insufficient investment levels, which prevents industrial capacity development.
But, in general, it is possible to assume that by the end of the year, the rate of RF falling will slow down to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015," said analyst of GK Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of sportsmen, recently launched in Russian football and enjoyed well in winter sports in Socia, is not so actively developed in summer sports.
If the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and former aliens are speaking, mostly, it is about descendants of the former Soviet Republics of the Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can see the reverse process -- a large number of Russians standing under the flags of other States.
In any case, the history of change in nationality is different.
Some parents were taken to another country as a child, without leaving a choice.
Someone did not stand a competition for a Russian meeting.
Someone believed that abroad would create best conditions for sports development.
Aif.ru found at least 16 sportsmen who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In a German passport, a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
But earlier, she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omska.
Just four years later, once the Soviet Union crashed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow her senior sister’s steps, to take easy athletes.
Just like the sister, Lisa chose jumps with six.
She stays in Russia, and I don't think she could "scroll off the throne" Elena Isinbaev.
Unfortunately, in the Rio Lisa Olympics, it will be our only landlord, even former, in the sixth jumping sector.
Her best achievements in this form of sport are the bronze of Europe's 2010 championship and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaev.
29-year-old Elena Piroskov was born in New Kuzanka in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandasists in the evangelist direction.
Mostly because of their faith, they left to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in a small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started fighting in school.
In showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where the U.S. Training Centre continued its courses under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izbinikov.
In the 2012 Olympics, Elena lost her first fight in London.
But the world champion of the same year is winning.
By the way, she won silver in 2010.
Thereafter was bronze 2013 and silver 2014.
26-year-old Mary was born in Jaroslavla, where she first met the synchronous swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Mary continued her classes.
Soon, she was in the United States assembly and showed great results in the Pan-American games.
Understandably, at a serious international level, it could not compete with Russian synchronists, but for America it was a ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Christina Shaldibina received at the age of 11 when her parents decided to continue training a girl from behind the ocean.
Until then, the girl was in her favorite sports in Yaroslava.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly entered the youth gathering of the country and later broke into the main national team.
In the Pan American games, 19-year-old Christian won gold and silver.
At the first position in the world scene, she had not had to fight, but for the United States, she organized a real breakthrough, which led to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former artist, Yana Beresko-Marggrander, who speaks for Germany's assembly.
She was born in Toliatti.
In 2008, when a girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospects for a national meeting.
Soon, she was already representing her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, indeed, it could only take 17 places not enough for the final competition in the first place.
But two years earlier, she was able to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Youth Games.
Another gymnast, only this time, Irina Sazonová.
If the ways to emigrate the previous sportsmen can be called standard, the choice of Irina's family is very unusual, Iceland.
Ira is a trainer in the Volgograd sports school.
Of course, in Iceland, she immediately became the country's champion.
It is true that Ira is trained in Russia, a special arrival in order to avoid losing skills.
In Rio, she was not as good as she wished.
The best place is 40 in the private board.
Notes about the swimming Maria Uglkova in the Russian information space are very few.
Maria has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for a long time, she was under the Russian flag, showing good results, even the country's record was 200 meters away by battery.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began speaking under the red-white flag.
In Rio, its best performance is 14 in the integrated estate of 4x100.
In order to get into the games, the girl launched a croudfunding project that made it possible to collect about 6,000 francs, which allowed her to pay for training for the Olympiade.
A 31-year-old free-style fighter, Adam Batirov, spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During that time, Hasavurt's descendant was able to become the three-fold championship of Europe, Russian champion, the Russian sport master of the international class.
When he stopped entering our national assembly, it was time to think about a change in nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports cities.
The Triumph Return took place at the Asia Championship in 2016 - Bahrain was already represented by Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a trip to the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kamenova, is even less known in the family than Swiss sailing Maria Ugolkova.
The thing is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started sporting gymnastics.
He has not achieved great success at the international level.
In Rio, its best results were 40 places to qualify on parallel brushes.
But for New Zealand, even the Olympic Games in sports gymnastic is a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There the girl continued its synchronous swimming, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, the girl at the European Championship in Berlin took the sixth seat in synchronous swimming.
In the duet with Eugenea, the Tetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth seat.
It was the fifth in the solitary programme.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitri Croiter has served as a congregation of Israel.
When a boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
During 2009, at 17 years of age, Dmitri became a country's champion.
The same year he won the youth champion of the world.
A year later, Croiter won the gold of the youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to jumps high, Dmitri is jumping in length and triple jumping.
A 31-year-old Albert is another Hasavurt harvester who, after long talks for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which would be represented in Rio.
In Russia, he spoke for the Higher Sports Arts of Krasnoyarska, and in 2011 even became the country's champion.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the SSSR team on the volleyball of Yaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before the birth of the son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyballist of the planet.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
There, the family remained for permanent residence.
In 2015, he became a bronze championship of Europe in the territory of his new family.
Hajiev was born in Chechen in 1994 and was with his family at the very highest level of war.
Ten years later, parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to that northern country — to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn free combat.
He soon won the world's firstship among the youths and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the fighting tournament.
And again a free fight, and a former Russian again.
This time it will be about the North Osetian descendant, who emigrated to Spain, the Times Frieve.
At the end of December 2012, he was assigned to Spanish citizenship, and currently served as the assembly team of the country.
Before that, a 30-year-old athlete has been able to mark high results in Russia.
It became a bronze championship of the country 2007 and 2008.
The Statute of Disappearance was decided to change sports citizenship.
The last in our list is the Czech boxer born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahackala, Arthur Biarslanov.
When a boy was ten years old, his parents took his family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur began to take care of his older brother’s advice.
Since then, Arthur was three times the champion of Canada, and in 2012 he became a world champion of youth.
In 2015, Biarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, first for his new family since 1975.

Marriage, she has a son.
Why are the kids in school classes?
According to Governor B. Condratiev, “the saying must be raised not by action or parade, but systematically”.
They must grow and at least since seven years of age realize that they must be cocasians and education.
But as long as this work seems to be done formally, I suspect it's more on paper.
If the poison classes take into account all the positive things that have been accumulated earlier at the quality of the new level, I will be pleased.
If we don't know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
HCK continues to remain one of the most criminal sectors in the country's economy.
There is a perpetratory of funds allocated to the needs of the communal sector from different levels budgets.
According to Gen Prosecutors, excessive tariffs are one of the most frequent crimes in the field of CAP.
As a result, consumers of the region have over 170 million rubs overpaid energy.
In the days and the Prosecutor's Office of the Red Days found the facts of inclusion in the tariffs of unfounded costs.
The costs of the OO “IV-consulting” (consuming cold water) were based on 4 million car rentals at a price higher than the market.
And such examples are in the country of mass.
The people pay for the "communal" for the last money, paying properly - according to the Ministry of RF, the average salary rate of the population is 94 per cent.
It was accused immediately by several articles of the Criminal Code: dissolving, legalizing income received by criminal means, abuse of powers, etc.
In the case of the investigation, as the head of the fund that was working on urban renovations, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, not actually performed, but paid.
Businessmen just returned him a lot of money.
As the owner of the UK, Macarov collected money from the population, but he did not pay and spend it to the suppliers for his needs.
As a result of the damage to the budget and the inhabitants, millions of rubles.
Scheme of Macarov's madness, unfortunately, is typical for Russia.
A total wave of arrests and detention of the heads of the UK, which were contributing to citizens.
In Camchatka, the trial of A. Love is ongoing, by the way, by the way, by the former deputy of the Horsebeth, accused of the deception of 91.7 million rubs.
In the case of the investigation, in 2012-2013, he established six governing companies and created 3 society with limited responsibilities.
One of them worked for the UC, two others played the role of the calculation centres, i.e. taking money from the population.
However, the A. Kohan had not listed the funds, but spent on himself, the loved one.
It's pretty difficult to judge in the field of CHC.
Things don't get excited, they're delaying.
And “help” in this extremely confused housing legislation,” believes Lightlan Razvertneva, Executive Director of the NP " CHCK Control " .
We are not able to earn one law, as we invent a new, which should make the previous work work.
Professionals, including judges, are also few.
Advocates themselves recognize that housing rights in the bonds are very little attention.
The refusal of criminal proceedings, the wolves during the investigations are also referred to in the Gen Prosecutor's office.
Of the production of 3,5 thousand crimes in 2015, less than half is addressed to the court.
After the rest of the investigation, it was long-term, and every fifth was suspended in connection with the non-institution of the accused.
Disadvantages in law enforcement authorities are often reported to gaps in existing legislation.
The law exists, but the authorities of learning do not rush to excite and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, approximately 230 counterfeit reports were raised -- only 60 criminal cases.
In 5 months of the current year, their number increased only less than 99.
What is the fake of the housing protocol?
This means that the change in the management of houses, financial and other issues go to the circulation of the owners' views.
This also means that normal companies who want to work honestly, rather than "free" people, can not go through the housing-communal services market.
There are minor and medium-sized housings.
First of all, by eradication of corruption as such throughout the State, Anton Žarkov, a member of the Ownership Committee.
And now this work is actively done.
It's not just a single share -- it's a targeted course to combat corruption.
Of course, not in all regions such a sad situation.
In particular, it doesn't smell like scandals in the capital.
Why does Moscow have no scandals in the field of CHIC as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital Government has demonstrated iron will and has arranged,” said AIF, Anatoli Election, a member of the Committee on Security and Resistance of Corruption.
I mean both the personnel, the legislative amendments and the legal education.
Managing companies have established close supervision, and all of them have been licensed.
The complaints of the towns are quickly resolved in public space (and inhabitants ' treatments and response measures are placed on the portal of the Government of Moscow).
Many are not just paying monthly credit cards, but carefully watch what the house is written.
Awareness among the population of the rights of owners and commitments of resource supply and management organizations is very high.
In addition, Moscow verifys the validity of housing and housing services, since a lot of budgetary funds go on grants and benefits for numerous categories of populations.
This must be all together and explain the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Does it turn out that everything's up to the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe it's worth changing the job.
Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to renounce friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has launched the U.S. ultimatum, offering a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Guleen, a Islamic preacher accused of the organization of a State revolution.
He stated that, speaking to his advocates in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to renounce the support of the “terrorism organization of fethhullahists”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the diversity in Turkey and the Western relations is increasing and can lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
" Early or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO.
Either organizing FETO or democratic Turkey.
It must make this choice," quoted the Anatolic Agency of Erdogan, which sounded on Wednesday night in Ankara, quoted.
The President of Turkey once again, but he has already demanded that the United States fulfil his first rebellion.
Recall that, at the night of 16 July, Turkish army highly appointed representatives had been attempted to dismiss the legitimate authority in the country, as well as an attempt for the life of the head of the State.
However, after Reggiep Erdogan spoke to the population, the rebellion was overwhelmed and his organizers and participants were arrested.
Some 8,000 people were suspected, with a number of teachers and scientists, other than soldiers.
According to Reggiep Erdogan, they were spoken as a teacher in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States of Fethullah Guleen.
The members of Erdogan also allowed that Americans could also be involved in the convergence.
All claims had been objected to all claims in their own way, refusing to issue Guillene and advising to change the tone.
The latest statement by the representatives of the State of the State account was made at the time of the visit of Erdogan to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, it does not stop the President of Turkey -- he insists on his own, and also insists on the demands for other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the European Union's migration agreement if Brussels does not refer to the date of abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," Turkey's Minister for EU Affairs, Omer Čelik, said on 9 August.
He said that the changes made by Ankara to the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would threaten Europe's own security.
Notice that on 1 August, the Deputy Chancellor of Germany, Zigmar Gabriel, requested Turkey to stop the EU's blackmail by pleasing to open the borders for migrants to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were a response to the relevant statement of head of MID of Turkey, Mevlut Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement, Chavushoglu, made in the past Wednesday, provided that Turkey could leave NATO.
The Turkish head of the MID did not exclude that the country would consider the possibility of leaving the Alliance unless it encountered its expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in defence is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries who cooperate with foreign States in the defence sphere, they import rockets," said Chavushoglu in an interview with the Anadolu Agency.
He said that Turkey must now establish its own defence system on the basis of its technologies and cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has so far tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have started looking for others," the Minister said.
Experts believe that all of this indicates serious differences in Turkey with the West and the reorientation of the country to the east.
The Head of the International Institute of Political Experts, Eugene Minchenko, believes that Regep Erdogan is currently playing his game and cannot go to a strong conflict with the West.
He has a lot of commitment to the West and business, and from a military perspective (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance with the Western framework.
Although, of course, the Americans would be more comfortable to see a fully obedient person at this post," Aif.ru explained.
He said not only that after the Turkish leader ' s statements (a non-payment of EU compensation, the requirement for visa space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States) would be pressured on it.
"Recep Erdogan will face the deterioration of relations with America and the European Union, with the pressure on it for humanitarian issues, for the dictatorial methods of country management and so on, " Minchenko believes.
The head of the Centre for Political Information Alexei Muhin accepts that the President of Turkey has changed its views in relation to Russia as soon as it benefits.
Seven months ago, Erdogan took a very strong position on Russia and seek favor in the West in all ways.
In a very short period, the situation has changed to the opposite.
Guarantee that in a while, the President of Turkey has not changed his priorities again, no.
I think Erdogan entered the period of manual diplomacy.
Once it is between the two pols, the West and Russia, he will try to gain the maximum benefit of himself," believes Muhin.
In his view, the main challenge for the President of Turkey today was to maintain political authority in the country, and he needed Russia and partnerships with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States would stop supporting Gulean.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States that control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Consensus with Turkey will therefore be achieved," the expert considers.
Another view is followed by the head of the Asia Centre and the Middle East Anna Glasov.
Turkey and the EU, and the United States, are now quite tense, and this is mainly related to the internal policy that Erdogan is conducting personally.
I think that the crisis in relations will be worsened, and the Turkish leadership will try to reload policies both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
The President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, not accidentally claimed that they were willing to change their position on a number of Syrian issues, a solution to the relationship with Israel, has been actively politically intervened with Iran," explained Aif.ru Glass, allowing the next step of Erdogan to be a normalization of relations with Egypt.
She said that the policy that Erdogan is currently conducting is the return to the course of an external political concept followed by Turkey before the beginning of Arab revolutions.
"Thereafter, in the positions of " no problems with neighbours ", Turkey began very actively developing its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
The visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa have now been very successful.
Therefore, this external policy vector will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey ' s positions both in the regional and international arena," the expert believes.
Glasovy believes that returning Turkey to former relations with the EU would be incredibly difficult, and now the question is whether the EU would be able to respond to Turkey, which could go to the opening of the borders for migrants and create serious problems for Europe.
Strike of younger doctors: Calls for new collective protests
The representatives of the younger doctors requested the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute on the new labour treaty.
The Committee of Younger Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) will ask for its full council to support more collective protests since September.
JDC said that the ministers were unable to answer the questions of the labour treaty.
Younger doctors and medical students voted in July for annulment of the contract on the labour contract agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in a secret vote.
In a letter to the members published in Twitter on Thursday night, President JDC Ellen McCort said that the Government continued to " keep silent" on issues that, as she said, led to the deniedment of the labour treaty.
She said, "In view of the situation, the JDC manager voted for the rejection of the proposed new labour treaty in full, and called for official repeated negotiations on all your issues."
In response to the silence of the Government, the JDC leader today requested an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of BMA to endorse the continuous programme of enlargement of collective protests from early September.
The argument led to the participation of young doctors in six strikes this year, including the first universal strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The Leader of Younger Doctors, Dr. Joan Malawana, resigned after a vote for abolishing the agreed conditions of the labour treaty recommended by BMA.
He told members of BMA that the deal was a good deal to be adopted during the meetings in the pre-voting of 54,000 young doctors and students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that this labour treaty would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Allians of Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the golden palace in St. Petersburg, I had an impression that Ankara wanted more reconciliation.
It was a shake, yes.
But the smile of Mr. Putin looked tight, and he barely emitted the heat even by his own restraint standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Mr. Putine, five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be returned not only to their docrisic level but even higher.
The next day, one newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's action as if nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm suggested the opposite.
But the drowning cold from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
In fact, the crisis was the first reason he mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey had struck a Russian executive on the Syrian border.
Moscow's response was at this point uncertain.
Mr. Putin was smashed by anger tirada, accusing Ankara of the attack of Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger, based on the assumptionable friend.
Recovery of real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
During months, the media-controlled States had an impressive, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious accusations were from the representatives of the Supreme Guide that the own family of Mr. Erdogan had gained illegal trade in oil from Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denyed it decisively.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
Finally, this meeting was only because Mr. Putin received an apology that he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim to win its kind.
For Ankara the advantages of the reconciliation announcement are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he could get after he was almost removed from his post last month when he tried to turn.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shook him too.
There is also a economic reason.
Russian sanctions have severely hit — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast annually.
The quantity dropped almost by 90%.
With regard to Russia, tourists and charter companies will, of course, feel relief when flights finally renew.
They put on the end of the Mediterranean sea.
Even this week, the public television foretold cheaper fruits and vegetables, as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products are re-established.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," said the report.
But the visit also had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara's wretched to the West for what she considers a weak response to an attempt to turn.
Add to this its displeasure with the progress of the talks on accession to the EU and the step of Mr. Putin, which strives to use coldness and gradually destroy Turkish relations with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the bonus scores with Ankara for calling for support of the elected authorities after attempting to reverse the State.
Remember, this is the data for Moscow, which has its own deeply rooted fear of the change in the regime.
So the summit in this brilliant coast of the sea has allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as "the Alliance of Bad," two countries who feel rejected and humiliated by the West are joining forces.
However, despite the public reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
It may be said for themselves that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, while two presidents were giving the press conference, they had not even touched the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin had preferred to emphasize them.
There is no clear consent in how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility, and taking into account the possibility of a complete disaster, when a member of NATO, Turkey, struck a Russian reactive executive, was certainly better than two leaders speaking at least again.
The Royal Scotland Bank will disappear for customers outside Scotland
Brand RBS should be summarized to the bec office, according to the Executive Director of the Bank.
The Royal Scotland Bank will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross MacEwan told Scotland BBC that the RBS brand was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank departed from them since it almost fell eight years ago and was needed to be saved.
During that period, the Brand Strategy used RBS to protect other brands of consumer loans.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsoring assistance to international sports, from the Six Nations on Rugby to the champion of Wimbledon Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it was right to allow more national brands to come into the first plan.
The Royal Scotland Bank will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and the fund market, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for banking services for private persons who will be more influenced, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan interviewed clients and staff in Inverssshire.
He said BBC Scotland, "Brend RBS will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our personnel will be busy, because we are now more than a bank of brands."
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying that we don't have global desires anymore, we have local desires.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its population groups, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS already stated that it would not be to continue its sponsoring support of the Six Nations Cube, and it raised the profile of various brands in sport sponsoring.
"It is the right time for us to move the bank of the brands, as in the base (we asked ourselves) how we focus on improving the customers' bank?", said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynicly three years ago, if we said we were going to be a great bank for clients and closing all these brands.
But with the work we've done, focusing on the needs of clients, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can get these brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori comes to 3,000 winners in Newmarket in Strasties
Dettors spray the champagne after the Duple in Newmarket brings it to 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark by means of his second winner of the night on his home track, on the Fascity trained by John Gosden.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey, who has reached this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Long Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Iddery and Willy Carson.
The three-fold Champion of Dettori, who won Ghayyar earlier, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I'm very glad that this happened in Newmarket, because that's where I've settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big world event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free of business and I'm very unpleasant.
Dettories are applauding when the Presentation after victory
Two Jockeys have reached such a mark in barriers: Richard Johnson's champion of Jocques and a 20-fold retirement champion, Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4300 wins for the record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career victory
Frankie is one of the best Jockeys in the modern era, and it is not surprising that he has reached the mark that so few have reached.
It's style and strong, but it's his tactical slipper that distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He was an excellent representative for jumping, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago to Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey of weekends and big jumps!
And seriously, Frankie brought the winners in Britain most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energy character that's good for British jumps, but more than that, he's an incredible joke.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this famous marking by a firm rapid slipper from the horse
From urgency to rapid leaps, Frankie Dettori is a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
It was flying and falling.
Many winners of large jumps, including his famous " Great Seven" in Ascota in 1996, but he also survived an air crash and was disqualified because of the doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed the huge strength of his will to challenge skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have ended for a while -- Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue to participate in competitions, at least until the age of 50.
Putin dismissed the head of the Administration of Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his head of the administration of Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the trusted nearby circle of Putin for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed as an environmental and transport representative.
The statement from Kremlj states that Putin " has decided to release Ivan from his duties of the head of the Russian administration of the President," but did not indicate the reason.
Mr. Ivanov has been appointed as successor of Mr. Ivanov since 2012, Anton Wyno.
Mr. Wyno, 44, former diplomat.
Born in Estonia Talline in 1972, he ended the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the embassy of Tokyo.
Later, he was head of the Chairman's Protocol and Government equipment, reports the Kremlin website (Russian).
During his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Heads of State in the area of the development of draft laws and control of how your instructions are implemented.
Putin informed one Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov asked him to release him from that position and recommended that Vino replace him.
Are smiles persuasive?
This is the move that confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest participants of Vladimir Putin and, like him, served in the Soviet Security Service, KGB.
As the head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on public television, both men stated that the head of the administration resigned on their own requests.
But despite the smiles on the camera, this has convinced few people here -- especially now, right before parliamentary elections.
So, is this an unforeseen consequence of any combat for power?
Not until anyone knows.
However, the official statement that a person who was once agitated as a potential president suddenly wanted to manage Russian environmental policy was encountered with huge skeptics.
In the observations of Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that in early 2012, I asked you to trust me in this very difficult position, even for four years.
Well, I was head of the president's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov entered office in December 2011.
He used to be the Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the KGB State Security Service as well as Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who arrived in the CGB, Ivanov was appointed as a deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanova among the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could be President of Russia after the second time of Putin, since the third term for Putin would contradict the constitution.
However, the post was taken by another close participant of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister until he returned to presidency only three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson was fired after the fight with the producer.
Gibson was a participant in the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, produced by series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologised on Thursday, before he was announced to be removed.
There were creative disagreements in the shooting and distinction in views.
I'm sorry that this happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be deleted from the show watching the team of FBI agents is expected to be done later, according to the statements of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor who had previously played a major role in Darma and Greg's site was at the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love "Myselle as a criminal" and I have invested my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," said Gibson in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but now it's not possible.
I just want to thank the scenarios, the producers, the actors, our great team, and, most importantly, the best fans of the show could have dreamed of.
It was indicated that the show would be returned with its twelfth season on 28 September.
Mystery: Fish landed in Banfa's garden
A man from Banfa asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bane believes 75 fish could be sandwiches left in water.
Bane, living 500 meters from the sea, put a picture of this scene in the Periscope in hope that someone will be able to light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferi Crossing: Bridge is now connected to Fife
The project of 1.35 billion pounds should now be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern spring and Viaduk Quinsferry Crossing — which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four shifts between the plates, which are now coming to the end of all three pilones of the bridge.
The Fife Bridge section is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
There are 10,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 want bridges.
The project of 1.35 billion pounds should now be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, visited today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferi Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering art really an epical scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the viaduc and bridge displacement is a virtual operation using extraordinarily precise collection permits.
Overall, about 79% of the whole bridge canvas is now in place, for the last section, the concrete cover is poured in Rosate today, which means that everything is ready to lift up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first deployment on each bridge project is always an important skill.
In this remarkable project, it is the most modern construction art.
After installing the last section of the road sheet and connecting it to the expanding road sheet of the North Pilon, we had to close the remainder in the north, or the side of the shore.
This was made by a viaduc of the northern approach 700 millimeters southern.
It was a great and very delicate operation at the same time.
The scale, because the viaduk length of 222 meters, was about 6,000 tonnes and was to be raised at a angle of a slope of about 3%.
It was excellent because the arguments on which the team worked were small — only a few mills in each direction.
Fortunately, it went very well.
Rescue in Moelfr Gulf: Three men are "happy to stay alive"
Three men were lucky to stay alive after they were thrown out of the fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station alarmed the British summer time on Friday at 13:20 after the team saw the event in Moelfr Bay.
Three men tried to get to a safe place, while their ship continued to move.
"We saw their ship circled next to them and predicted the worst," said Moelfry Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, until we came down to the water, the strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were saved through a local fishing vessel, and the third man for 60 years was found exhausted and incorporated into a bow without a rescue vest.
All of them were raised on a coast rescue boat and delivered to the rescue station
Jones said, "The three men thrown into the water were lucky that they were alive and completely harmless.
The boat engine had an emergency loop, but he kind of pulled away from a man running the boat when he wake up.
Someone's been protecting these guys today.
Pokemon Go, worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
The fact that adolescents and children are no longer outside to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, was a complaint of many in the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and involves some physical activity.
The time in the screen was initially limited to television, then video games and recently smartphones.
It is so great to see that technology and activity on the streets are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the popular interest of Pokemon Go, the application based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (after a series of multifilms, cards and other replies).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomenons, this has lost its former relevance a few times before this new game was available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The launch in other countries was then detained in connection with the mass response that reloaded the servers.
In the few days, Pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter had.
So how's it working?
In two words, smartphone players are going to look for Pokemons who are tracked on the GPS and, as discovered, can be photographed (in your phone) or captured.
The generation that played a game, as younger, joined in the slow excitement, opening the couches to search.
In the United States, the game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of " ordinary" steps every day.
Cardiogram, Apple Watch, which tracks 35,000 users, recently reported Washington Post that during two days since the startup of the game, the number of people who had been monitored, who had been performing 30 minutes daily, increased from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokemon Go, she just sees the primary data on the level passage.
Many healthcare campaigns that persuade people " to find 30 minutes " , " get out of the couch " and " be active every day " did not respond because most health messages are boring and express people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of physical exercises cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the chances of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to adjust weight, high arterial pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokemon Go is that it pushes people out to do what they love.
This includes three basics of health: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends in hunting.
As usual, there are boring boring people looking for what they're seeking.
And, yeah, someone can get into the door.
So what?
There's a breakthrough.
In spite of the fact that the Smartphone apps, such as Fitbit, could have monitored our physical activity before, did not give us a reason for learning, as this game gives us.
The news will arrive, and the use will be weakened with time.
However, the success of Pokemon will result in more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simona Byles wins the gold of the absolute prime in female gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the freak.
Simona Byles is insecure to all of this.
Dynamic on a resistant jump.
She's not forced on the belly.
She's scary on the floor.
Excellent everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnastic risen to the title of the absolute champion on Thursday, putting a ruin between himself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under the Olympic attention.
Her total score 62.198 was sufficiently removed from the silver medalist and the Final Five Team, Ali Risman and the Russian Bronze Medalist Alia Mustafina.
Byles from the United States has been at a gymnastical beef during the final of the female individual absolute gymnastic primary at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byles became the fourth in order of an American woman who won the title of the champion of absolute firstship and the fifth at all, reputing her reputation as the best of her generation and, possibly, ever.
She was crying when she showed her final common score and her long trip to that moment ended.
This achievement puts her in the same league as very rare light athletes, such as Michael Felps, who raised their sports to new heights:
Byles spent the last three years, dominating in her sports, wining 15 medals of the world's championship -- including 10 gold -- with such remarkable programmes in their mixture of labour and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984, Mary Lou Retton, called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen".
One last test was expected in Brazil, competing not as much as Bails and the others in this area as the burden of the expected.
Nothing less than going back to your family's house in Spring, Texas, with a bunch of gold medals, would be considered unreasonable expectation.
Simona Byles from the United States, on the left, and Ali Risman are hugged after the winning of gold and silver, according to the final of the women's individual absolute gymnastical primary at the Summer Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Avg.
Byles earned the first gold on Tuesday, became a beautiful final accord for the farewell party resigned by the coordinator of the National Assembly of Marta Karoli.
While Bailes insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, it's not exactly so.
The part of its free exercise program, which includes its firm passage, is set on Latin American music, which would be just like the streets outside the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, dedicated to her grandfather and grandmother as a child-looking and opening mother of Coach Amy Boorman during a visit to the hall where Boorman was a coach, became a force.
She has not lost any absolute competitive competition since summer 2013 — a threshold that should continue as long as Bailes wishes.
Although Mustafina had a small advantage with two turns, it was a mirage.
The gymnastical brew and free exercises — where Byles protects the name of the world champion — are trapped.
It regained from 15.433 on the board and ended with 15.933 on the floor.
Rajsman hugged her softly while they were waiting for the final account — pure formality — and the tears appeared around a brilliant red with the white and blue water for the eyes of Bails, when the idea that she had ever recorded in the album for cutting was accomplished.
Risman's speech was a small place for the four years ago, when she shared the third place, but she lost Mustafin's bronze on the Tai Breike.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which Americans call "baby" was far ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise covered by return, which sometimes seemed to be questioned.
With regard to Bails, the 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week now has a new importance:
Police: 3 victims in a serial killer were shot during auction of music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most death attack on the first serial killer of Phoenix in the last decade, were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to the reports of the police published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Lyner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was parked on the passage part, the authorities declared.
The perpetrator took about eight shots from the gun, standing on the passenger side of the car and then hiding on another vehicle, reports the report.
The police claim that the triple murder is apparently not a result of the robbery, since the offender did not take a purse or $2,900 in charge of one of the adult victims.
The Phoenix Police Representative, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting forced investigators to check if he had been linked to four previous attacks.
Seven people were killed and two others were injured as a result of nine attacks in two mostly Latin American areas for four months.
"It is happening in the housing area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, the CBS branch at the beginning of this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including brown Nissan at the end of the 1990s, black BMW at the end of the 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the testimony that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Lyner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died in place.
The Witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also issued the police's report on the shooting targeted by an empty truck half an hour before the three-hour murder, which was allegedly the case of a serial killer's hands.
The investigators found the boats and pulled the bullet out of the seat and the fragments of the bullets from the engine segment.
A mother of a 6-year-old child with a microcephalia: " Better"
Like most six - year - old children, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has a microcephalia as a result of a genetic violation that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign for that.
Which is not true -- of course, you are signing for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund may never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical institution.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that," Pixivto explained.
Edmund's walking through walkers.
Edmund didn't sit down and crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't.
But he slowly passs some stages.
He walks with foreign help and rides a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund made for "please sing me."
"We teach him a sign language," said Pixivto CBS News.
But it is not just a common sign language, but it says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalia may result in a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as cow and Zica.
Symptoms and forecasts may be significantly different.
It's too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected by Zik's virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I keep telling you what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a prediction for my life because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has an inspiring advice for the mothers of children with birth defects due to Zik.
It's getting better.
You know everything will be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Silent rain, flood is the cause of rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
The strong rain and widespread flood in Louisiana forced the Governor to announce an emergency situation on Friday, with more declines expected to fall over the state before Saturday.
Many rivers in Louisiana and south of Mississippi have emerged from the shore and threatened the widespread flood after the extreme quantity of landings, reported the National Meteorological Service.
Governor of Louisiana John Bell Edwards stated that government officials were constantly contacted with local authorities and that assistance had already arrived to the injured income.
Mike Still, representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Preparation for emergency situations, stated that demands for high water, boat and sand bags were being made.
Still said that only Tanjipahoa came in has asked tens of thousands of sand bags.
The danger of the flood remains in force until Saturday in the majority of the southern Louisiana.
The weather service stated in the statement that additional 3 to 5 inches could swim into the area.
In South Alabama, the flood was expected to work until Friday, since the rain continued to go to Mobile area.
The Comith River next to Baton Rouge and the Amit River, next to Dan Springs, both in Louisiana, were expected to set the record of the flood level in the past weekend.
Synoptic Alec Crowtmann said that both rivers could flood a lot of houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flood flowing down in Assensensen was a threat, since these expansive rivers would slowly steal into the lake of the Morpe.
The Tikfo River, a slightly southern border of Mississippi in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest of the ever registered levels at 9 p.m.
Saviors were still pulling people out of the flood in Amit and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and passionate were among the rescued early Friday near Glouster.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Bever Crik, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, were rapidly raised for the night.
He said that another passenger who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water continued to go," said Hansford.
She's reached my belt level.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest influx she saw in 48 years living here.
Hansford said he and all his family had disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that the rescue officers saved all three with the army truck and delivered them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Crowtmann says that the flood is rapidly spreading, since the rain continues, noting that officials are considering the evacuation order.
Crowtmann said that one observer near Livingstone reported a drop of 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Crowtmann said that the soil was overflowed by rainfall from the Wednesday.
The strong rain and the drowning of the streets led to rescue residents from homes in Tanjipahoa and the cancellation of classes in the five school districts, stated the authorities.
WWL, CBS branch, reported that Tanjipahoa advisor told about 200 heated houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but both of them are now warming.
The President of the arrival of Robbie Miller stated that the authorities saved 72 people and seven household animals in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amit and Hammond to accept those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to come home as soon as the water begins to withdraw," he said.
In the city of Hammond the arrival of Tanjipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed because of the high level of water, and sand bags were available to extradite the inhabitants in hope that they would keep the water away from homes and enterprises.
"The last large flood we had was in March," said city governor Lacey Landrum.
It's on the way to become a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison District, the Chief of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey, reported that the burst rain continued to go to the coast of the Mexican Gulf.
He said that several houses were registered as melted on Thursday, but none of them were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, head of the Shopper Value Foods Store in Amit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tawson, and she's still flying on the ground."
Mahaz Brown, 6, "determined by bullets" remains alive after the shooting in Philadelphia.
The police reported that a six-year-old boy in Philadelphia was shot, registering a second shooting in the city this week.
Grandma and grandpa recognized him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaz Brown.
Grandma and grandpa say that Brown got numerous fire wounds, including his smell, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He got a lot, his small body was shot by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melandez station said.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in a critical state in the hospital and has experienced several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to be well.
He was supposed to go to the first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in in Jermantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29 and one 32-year-old.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-old men was critical; two other victims were registered in stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found fired at the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical state, reports the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators reported to CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a shooting between several armed people.
The semi-automatic weapons sneakers of various copies of semi-automatic weapons have set up a place of action.
It seems that it was definitely a long-term battle.
There were boats on the street, on both sides of the board.
Therefore, it appears that there were several armed fighters, and they were actively involved in the shooting," said Captain of Philadelphia, Anthony Ginaldi.
Many houses and cars in this area were also hit.
No arrests have been produced, and the police have reportedly been watching video cameras.
Another six-year-old child, a girl, was hit by a bullet on Tuesday when she played in front of her house in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Lori?
This is what I call a female olympic gathering for gymnastics this year and for several reasons.
First of all, I've been on every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, three gymnastic gymnastics, Simona Byles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lore" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many white girls.
As a composition of this complementary, supplemented by Ali Risman, who is a Jew, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This gathering looks like America, finally.
This has also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this type of sport.
During the last four years, a female gymnast number one was an Afro-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were numbers 1 and 2.
It's powerful.
In the past Olympiad, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic Champion, and America welcomed.
The world could now be witnessed by the three-fold championship of the world, Simona Byles, Douglas and Lory Hernandez, who perform unexpected but still virtuous gymnastical exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American in order to win gold in a woman's individual absolute firstmanship.
And the colleague for Eli Risman's collection earned silver.
We become witnesses of this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like this in gymnastic sections around the country.
Simona, Gabby and Lori have all chosen the same path as Ali and Madison to form an Olympic assembly.
They're a "final five", because the next Olympic Gymnastic College will only have four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Marty Caroly's training.
But in fact, gymnastics are expensive sports, and the gymnasts are first trained in private gymnastical clubs supported by parents paying the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, contributions to competition, hotel services (for coaches and their gymnastics and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in rich suburbs that can support the business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get everything from their trainings, and they're expensive and long-term responsibilities for the gymnast families.
Amy Boorman, Coach Simona Byles, and Maggie Hannie, coach Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their sportsmen since they took the gymnastics.
We must create more acceptable at the price and accessible training for gymnastics to the communities of an unspecific number of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I found my gymnastical fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and dear gymnastic classes for more than 15,000 urban young people (usually black and Latin Americans) and raised national and international championships.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the sustainability of exhaustive work, discipline and persistence for mind.
This combination has a positive impact on good health, success in school and work throughout life.
The inspiration of this assembly will send thousands of girls into gymnastics, and this is great.
Sporting is so important, especially for girls.
It's a great time now.
Thank you, Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in the winning of the Olympic Gold Command and for motivating so many girls of different origin to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger doctors have taken up further strikes after Jeremi Hunt's proposal was rejected
The ministers were hoping to conclude a dispute on changes by agreeing with the amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced the plans for the introduction of this treaty, saying that NHS was on " no earth " and any subsequent delay would harm the staff and patients.
The first younger doctors are transferred to a new treaty, which includes changes in working at night and weekends to improve services within time.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the BMA Committee of Young Doctors, said yesterday in the statement: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that he would subdue the existing working force crisis and that it could not apply to all doctors fairly."
It was only eight weeks before the first group of doctors were transferred to a new contract, progress was needed and time was over.
The WMA attempt to resolve the negotiations was encountered by unwilling to take action and sometimes by full silence by the Government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremi Hunt has to act now, encouraging the introduction and respond to the fears of younger doctors.
If he does not, then the younger doctors are unequivocated that they are willing to organize follow-up strikes.
The latest strike at the end of April deferred some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses' receipts, while nurses and consultants were attracted to replace doctors on the picketing line.
The ministers were hoping to end the dispute on changes by agreeing with the amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
WMA wishes a better payment of the weekends for 54,000 younger doctors who will be subject to the treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Employers, called on the younger doctors not to continue strike.
Mortimer stated: “The strikes reach little or nothing, but are pressured on the team and services already working, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorder to patients, sittings and their families.”
For the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Younger Doctors and with the Department of Health and others, and have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of custody and corporate information policies.
Workers hoped that the continuing positive assistance on other important topics — such as the distribution of staff, the flexibility of training, the additional training for those who returned after a break in career, the cost of training, the mutual recognition of the training plan, the academic and gender distinctions in health care — were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education of England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the conditions reached by the WMA in November, February and May.
2 pounds per day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack will use a 2 pounds a day after the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and for longer time.
The tikagrelor anti-reflecting medicine reduces the risk of reinfections for people with cardiac diseases.
The preparation is already designated for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE National Health Service of Great Britain advised people to give it for four years in order to continue to exclude the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE National Health Service of Great Britain has now advised people to give it for four years in order to continue to exclude the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs to approximately 140 000 people in England annually, and a quarter of them have another infarction or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result in accumulation of fat material on the walls of arteries and the formation of flashes.
If the flash breaks into parts, it may be caused by a thrombosis that blocks the blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the plate moves, it will be able to move through the blood flow and block the bleeding to the brain by causing a stroke.
People who have already been attacked have been more likely to get another.
Tikagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold by Brilique, reduces the risk, making thrombosis less likely.
The project of the NICE instruction published today recommends that people be given 90 mg tikagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the efficient methods of secondary prevention, about four people who have had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or a stroke -- often with destructive consequences.”
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that tikagrelor, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of following heart attacks and infarctions in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
In prerecommendation of the tikagrelor, we are pleased to have an opportunity to increase the treatment available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the efficiency and safety of tikagrelor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment for longer than that period.
Cultural of the PC ownership allows for the fake of the accounting of votes in the Muslim regions
Ex-major Tower-Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from the post last year due to corruption by the Government report
The culture of political correction has led to the closing of the eyes, which has turned into a universal counterfeit of votes in the Muslim communities, on information from the destructive report of the Government published today.
The former member of the Ministerial Office, Sir Eric Pickles, has been criticized against the police, the observers of the elections and the city administration for ignoring the electoral infringement certificates due to “excessive sensitivity of raciality and religion”.
The former secretary of the local communities, now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of the voters on religious ground was so strong that the police had to allow borders outside the electoral stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that the voters take IDs to prove who they are when they vote.
At this point, the voters should only specify their name and address.
The report even suggests that unlaundered inks be put on the fingers of people when they submit their bulletins to exclude so that someone can vote twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to the informants, said Sir Eric.
He called upon the press to give greater access to the documents of the local Council and decisions taken by the informal committees or working groups.
"It is done not only to protect from fraud in the elections but also to protect the local Government from more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street due to a voted scandal in Tower Hamlets, East London.
Last year, a special court dealing with elections decided that the existing Mayor Luftur Rahman should be displaced from the post in connection with a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman “cinially distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and made his criticism shut up, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said, "He had his campaign, based on the obligation of the believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes had been questioned or resulted in personality when a person voted in representation of someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed special concerns about the fraud with an e-mail vote in which the senior members of the Muslim community reportedly have pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, on the photograph, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the requirement to bring his identity certificate to prove who you are.
His report states: “The pressure has been presented to vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities communities, in particular women and youth, to vote on the will of the elders, especially in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
"There were fears that... State institutions have closed their eyes on such behavior because of the excessive sensitivity of political correction on ethnic belongings and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations for the cleaning of the system, including the elimination of political activists from the work with mail bullets for voting to stop the "settlement of votes".
The report also calls for closed checks in the registration to prevent the use of the list of voters for immigration and privileges.
It is considered to require voters to make a personal certificate before the vote.
Use unlaundered inks on people's fingers as soon as they drop their newsletter to prevent anyone from vote twice.
To conduct systematic verifications of human nationality in order to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year restriction on requests for automatic mail voting.
Remove the political participants of campaigns and activists from work with voting and e-mailing envelope.
Allow the police to establish borders around the electoral stations.
Amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation in accordance with the Presentation of the 1983 People ' s Act.
Make illicit photographs in the electoral stations.
Require only English to be used in the electoral stations (except Wales).
Intensify training to ensure that the personnel forces voters to go to the box one by one.
Sir Eric attacked the city's police violently, claiming that it was "impressive" that no criminal charges have been made after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Luthur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corruption and illegal acts," he said.
He was found guilty of the lack of justified doubt, a criminal proof standard, on a number of grounds.
It also criticizes the ultimate " verifications for the cluster" of the electoral registration offices of urban administrations.
Sir Eric stated: "The last year judgment of the Tower Hamlets court was a wake-up signal.
Our nation has a proud heritage as a mother of parliamentary elections, and yet anxious and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy bicycle analogs of Kate and other famous twins of the Olympics in Rio
The fans of the Olympiada 2016 in Rio this week were mad at the French bikeist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, which appeared to be impressive as the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, the 24-year-old Olympic Game Participant is not the only sportsman fighting for gold this summer, who can commend his own famous double, at least in the social networks.
So, on the part of the Rio Games and all the famous persons appearing on our screens at this time, F.Š.S.A. made a list of Olympics with more than a surface similarity with Hollywood Stars.
A hunter and wolf: a member of the U.S. Arrowman, Brady Allison, left, compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's double on the bike track, many people have hurried online to indicate how a certain shooter could be a superstar twin of Leonardo DiCaprio.
The member of the U.S. shooter team, Brady Allison, became the cause of a hurricane in Twitter, after his pictures appeared to look scary like the wolf star from Wall Street.
And in fact, the shooter found out about social madness and admitted he heard he was like Leo since he was a child.
"I personally don't see a huge similarity, except for vegetation on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly show even more this year: the impressive similarity between the British skipper Greg Rutherford and the popular acter Neal Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Alia Mustafin, with her great express eyes, is said to be a precise copy of the Cuban-American singer of Gloria Estefan.
In the South African swimming pool, Cameron Van der Burg was compared to the star of Horus Matthew Morrison for many years.
Going to more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sports version" of the "Natchal" actress.
Another long-term comparison was between Rafael Nadar tennisman and actor Josh Harnett, who could be admired by similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The silver swimmer from Russia, Julia Ethimav, can not only commend the same burned skin and light hair as the actress of Annalin McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the United States team, according to fans, looks like a "sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
Hard women: Hope Solo, left and hero Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same forms of face and eye
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason that is based on a similar appearance of this couple
One Twitter user has recently contacted the site to admire his excitement that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
In fact, the U.S. football star and Dexter actress have incredibly similar forms of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the same smile of Laura Lynnie, as well as the winning gold medal of the Gimnast Gubby Douglas, which can commend with its own beautiful broad smile that looks like the star "Make success" Gabrielle Union.
The Olympiada commentator at CBC apologizes for saying about the Chinese swine "death as a pig"
Analysis of Byron McDonald's fourth seat at the 14-year-old Ai Yanghan women's estaphet in a free style of 4-200 m in the middle of CBC viewers in the Olympiada direct broadcast
The Canadian CBC broadcast company was forced to apologize after one of its commentsors said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimming "started as smell" and "dead like a pig" during the sailing.
The commentator Byron McDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began to express his own view at the end of the final female estate of 4x200 m in a free style.
It could be heard of McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC commentators in order to "dissolve it with color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese is a ball, baby."
Too excited, starting like a smell, dying like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimming Ai Yanhan, who was 14 years old, swimmed the second stage of the estaphet at 1:57.79, by 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rac, allowing the Canadians to remove their resignation from China.
Watchers across Canada reacted quickly on the network after they were shaken by tone and expressions used
Emmet McFarlane tweeted, "Do you really think the CBC dictator just said that a 14-year-old swineman from China died like a pig?"
This idiot didn't realize they were still in the air."
About Ai Yanghan from China in the female estate final, 4x200 m freely said, "That little 14-year-old Chinese has thrown a ball, baby."
The criticism in Twitter immediately crashed on Byron McDonald, and many called for him to be fired.
Twitter users did not abstain when they heard how unsensitive Byron McDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote, "Nothing about #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a racist. #disgusted.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who led the transmission of the CBC, apologised directly for McDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the swimming statement arrived in the air."
It was a bad choice of words, and we're sorry that this happened.
The SBI concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement
A friend of commentator Scott Russell had to apologize from McDonald
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained of MacDonald's comments
The teleseth also hurried to apologize and issue a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to enter the air.
Last night we acted urgently to apologize to our audiences in direct air and our subscribers in social networks.
Let's make it clear, the comments of Bajron were referring to the speaking of swimming, not as individuals.
And yet it was an inappropriate and inadequate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday day, McDonald apologizeed directly and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he didn't think his words would be interpreted as an attack on the personality.
'I would like to use a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the female estate', he said on the Olympic Games on CBC.'
'I was talking about the speaking of the swimmers, not of her personally.'
'Of course, there was no disrespect, and I am very sorry.'
The buyer of Primark insulted a woman who was insanely executing the underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers didn't know where to take a look when a woman was naked to sample pants on the floor with stores in the middle of Primark.
What's worse, she used how she looked in them, pulled them and put them back on the shelf.
She continued the search and eventually died four pairs of underwear in the Bouverie Place store in Falkstone.
The Store Primark of the Bouverie Place Trade Center in Falkstone, where the woman was using tricotage pants before putting them back on the pool.
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at that time, said that after a sample of the underwear, a mysterious woman again "closed and left the store, didn't buy anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the trading hall, she took a couple of pants from the visit, took off her own coats and coats and wore them.
"She didn't try to find a secret place to do it -- she was just standing there, ashamed."
"All looked at when she took off her pants again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelves."
She did the same with the three other couples before she finally decided there was nothing she would like, she was dressed and left.
"It doesn't seem to be like her care, who watched her, or that she thought of the man who would buy the pants she was using."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent, said, "How uncomfortable it is to think someone's going to take home the coats that someone else had wearing and not washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday day.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff appeared to have tried to remove these clothes from the sale after she left, even better."
"I wouldn't like to come home with a new couple of female cowards and find out that another woman had worn and took them off, and they were not washed."
The representative of Primark said, "Primark knows about the incident that happened in our Store in Falkstone on Tuesday 9 August."
All the goods that are concerned were removed from sale.
How to protect yourself from attacks with a gun using a witch thief
The world around is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help to make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Misracci, master of the Federation of Magicians in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Whether you are in front or in the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his weapons.
If they fit in the back, according to Misrachi, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and "free the line of fire."
Then you press a gun firmly between your shoulder and your shoulder before you hit them in the face of a free elbow.
Then you go to the knee in the smell, and while the attacker squeezes the pain, you scroll the gun out of his hands, beat him in the face of the gun and back, holding the weapons on it.
For the armed, suitable front, the way to do it is to get your body out of the fire line, quickly grab the gun and turn it out so that the evil man can't shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker's fist into the chest, then turn the gun out of his cap before you step back and target it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video to see exactly how Misrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery -- if you're not a master of the witch -- is to give your cash.
For the traveller, Jan Wright conducts his language in the most dirty places of Europe
The British traveller has given its immunity system and a revolutionary reflection to a serious test, licking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The leader and author of the books on travel of Jan Wright, 51, from Saffolk, conducted the euro banknote language, the Circuit Piccadilli, the toilet wash button in the train and the Russian public telephone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what it's going into.
But the experiment, which should become a film entitled "The Guide of the Lisun Travel for the Internal Force", gave some remarkable results.
The thought of slipping a wash button in a train used by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sheet.
During the whole European trip, Wright spoke to doctors and medical workers about the increase of the cardiac bacteria and its own health.
Fortunately, nothing of the lipstick was more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous by the tests on the strength of his worm, traveling in the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public seasons on stations to the toilet wash button, this task certainly tested its immune system
In the film he took off, he said, "I've been totally careless about my health, and I've dragged a lot of things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he gave up was a dirty Russian public toilet.
The test mast showed the value of a luminometer exceeding 4,000 units.
For comparison: Only washed hands must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after its luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while the washed hands showed less than 60.
Wright and Finnish breast-producer Valio took a film on a traveller entitled “The Guide of the Lisun Travel for Internal Force”, showing the number of bacteria in various places, such as the toilet
In the movie, he said, "It's close to one of the worst things I smelled in the bathroom."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The Leadership of the Lisun Travel for Internal Force was removed with the Finnish producer of Valio.
The company provided the Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygen bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D to help accelerate the growth of human wheat bacteria and develop an immune system.
The Senior Vice-President Valio said, "We really wanted to offer to consumers something new.
What would be interesting to look at and at the same time could explain the benefit of the probitants.
We had a brain strike that ended up with the idea "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in the health of the worm becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a large context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the health of the womb and how it is related to the immune system.
The growing interest in the worm health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary film we could provide more information to consumers in an interesting form.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was a film director, added, "Let's say this: I'd have lost respect for Jana if he licked some things I asked, for example, the disgusting Russian toilet that was shown in the movie."
Of course, some things were easier for Jana to lick, and some were pretty hard.
I'm glad that some of these lipsticks have been able to record.
During the 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of respondents linked oxygen bacteria only with good stomach and wheat, and 58 per cent said they were consuming, at least sometimes, products containing added oxygen bacteria.
The Huligan family destroyed Saltash, the municipal house of Cornoull, after the expulsion.
The Huligan family left its municipal house with losses of 50,000 pounds after they were expelled for frightening their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilkok were expelled from their property facility to Saltash, Cornwoll, after a long list of complaints against them.
Once they were forced to be expelled from the property facility, shocked housing cooperative officials discovered this property in the state of requiring repair.
The walls were left with shining holes, halfs were opened, the trash was broken down the floor and the walls were scattered.
The family is now moved and is supposed to be living in a private apartment
Donna McAvoy, a settler in Cornwall House, said she was afraid that she wouldn't save him.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are many things that need to be weighed because this property is likely to be known as not a very good perspective of Cornual.
This family uses a bad glory, and their name is used by a bad glory.
The couple had three sons living in real estate at times, and the police reported that the kingdom of the fear caused by the family included fights on the streets with baseballs, intimidating inhabitants of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, disputes and ridiculation.
Sceldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received a warrant for anti-social conduct in June.
In several rooms, a house that could be destroyed was found by an old trash.
The gender boards in the house in which drugs were sold in the past were ripped out
The neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Houseing forced her and her partner to move out of the house this week after they had been given a extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The expulsion was relieved by the neighbors who said that their lives were converted into a basic hell.
One said, 'They weren't worried.'
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is incredible.
'That morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet here, we're not used to it!
Now that they finally left, everything's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood Unit, said that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and they regularly called the police
The garbage and old toys were displaced below the municipal house
He added: 'It's a shame that the renter couldn't take any responsibility for her and her family ' s behavior, 'cause expulsion is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very complicated case, since the behavior was incredible, and their actions must have been terrifying for its neighbours.
I appreciate the work my team, the police and members of the community of Devon and Cornoull, who bravely spoke to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and send a signal that association behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at a different time, but said that they were a little more than 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the expulsion
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the garbage breast that is surrounding the house
In 2014, the police arranged a search in the house and found over 70 g of cannope, as well as weights, corresponding supplies, and 1700 pounds cash.
Sceldon was punished after he recognized himself guilty of the drug ownership of class B in order to supply.
She stated that the money was paying overgrave for her son, Lee Sceldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were made homeless, there was evidence that Tania and her partner now live in Plimute.
The walls of many rooms of the house were scattered graffitis all over the surface.
The police said they would try to expel renters who were not subject to the rules of rental.
Angela Crowe, from the Devon and Cornual Police, stated that this expulsion has sent clear warning to other renters who continue to breach the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they may be acting without accusations of the prosecutor and those who are injured of such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by the police of Devon and Cornual, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Portuguese tourists came to freak when a low-flying military plane nearly touched the beach
In the city of Aviru, Portugal, tourists who love sunlight were terrifying for their lives
Aeroplane P-3C Orion of Portugal Air Forces flyed incredibly low
Military air forces reported that he carried out a training flight, but insisted on the lack of safety risk
This is the moment when frightened tourists start to panic, while the low-flying aircraft spiked over the overwhelmed beach.
A military plane is seen on dramatic records, flying nearly at the distance from the sand hunters in Aviro, northern Portugal.
The resters jumped on their feet as soon as they became clearly concerned about the noise of the aircraft’s engines, but without the possibility of seeing what moves them through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near Aveira in Costa-Nova.
Daniel Fernandesh, one of the few vacationers who published a shocking video in social networks, said, "He's flying down two times, and there was a moment, at some point, it seemed to be broken."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and I swear, it was like the plane would just fall on me."
The tourists on the beach of Aveira were terrified when the plane came out of the fog and flyed on an extremely low height.
The Portuguese Air Force stated today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion carried out a training flight to detect fishing vessels on the coast and was forced to fall as low as it was the only way to verify them.
The pilot stated that the plane flyed a little below than it was usually due to the insufficient sight caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air forces insisted that no one was at risk.
During this summer, forest fires have damaged the mainland of Portugal, as well as four people in Madeira.
The portuguese air forces made the statement today that the pilot had to fly so low in the light of the circumstances — a dense fog and afforded from forest fires that deteriorated the visibility
The plane carried out a training flight, and the pilot was assigned to find fishing boats within the task
The HASSP system has already been compulsory for the companion for over a year, but most of the Petersburg cafes and restaurants have not yet been introduced.
The verifications are increasingly active and the business threatens fines to up to 1 million rubles.
For over a year, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, Russian version of HASSP) - a risk analysis and critical checkpoints are compulsory to the use of food producers and carriers, as well as companies in society in Russia, as a member of the Tamone Union (TS).
Business verifications by Rossenger in accordance with those standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
In the meantime, the officials shall only make fines for individual violations of the Regulation (see " Absence of documents " .
The failure to comply with the Regulation will cost a company of 600,000 rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
As a system that takes into account the risks of food and preventing foods, HASSP developed in the 1960s in the United States.
It was about the safety of food for astronauts.
The system is now used not only in the United States but in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating in the TS.
The development and implementation of the business system had been 4 years (HASSP needs appeared in the TS Teregulament in 2011).
However, entrepreneurs themselves and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of that rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been confident that the rule concerns only food production rather than restaurants,” explained the head of the General Council, Elena Ceretelli.
Now everyone's trying to get out of the way.
The expected renewal of charter flights to Turkey - the end of August - the beginning of September.
However, they will not ask for a very important demand, since their target audience - family with children - is already preparing for school, experts note.
The Alliance of Tourist Agencys sent a letter to the Government yesterday with a request to authorize charters.
"For many Russian tourists, the selection of quality and accessible sea vacation is unacceptable because most of the placement facilities are already reserved by the end of September," the authors noted and emphasized that the opening of charter transport in August would not significantly affect the demand for the Russian marine tournament.
As reported at the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Tourism Union (RST), if Russian and Turkey airlines are quickly agreed, the renewal of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding when the charters are renewed, it depends first on the aircraft.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even in August, if the tournamenters quickly build programmes and agree with airlines on ships necessary," said Paul Rumanci, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Division of RST.
He said that the possible renewal of charters was good news, but it would not affect the marketing of forces, because the main buyers of charter tours, family with children, have already returned from rest and are preparing for school or conducting vacation in other countries.
During the season, tours are mostly purchased by single travellers and couples.
The charter programmes may count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously," said Paul of the Romanians.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it presents a very budgetary proposal -- 50 to 60,000 rubles for two, because there are people who are aimed to await very cheap tours," said Valeria Rosental, Director-General of Optio-Travel Tourism.
Otherwise, the main mass of travel is already planned.
Paul Rumanians also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be required, but there is no need to wait.
"For Turkey, starting charters now is a rehearsal of the next season," said Paul Romanians.
"The opening of charters to Turkey is a positive news for the next season," Valerie Rubcevová agreed.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption of the NDFLs established by legislation of compensation payments within the approved standards relating to the damage caused by damage or other health damage.
The expenses of workers with harmful labour conditions are provided for in Article 222 of the TCP.
The rules and conditions of extradition, however, are established by the Ministerial Development of Russia of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, free expenses of milk or other equal food products are produced to workers on the day of actual employment with harmful labour conditions due to the employment of harmful production factors.
According to those rules, the Russian FNC concluded that, on the basis of the paragraph 2 p. 3 p.m. 217 of the NCF, the MDGs were released from the scope of the Milk Prices issued to workers on the day of actual employment with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Norms and the conditions approved by the Minimum Health Development of Russia of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
Moscow Gasburybank has lost the CB license.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the banking license from the credit organisation of the Joint Commercial Bank of the GAZSTROYBANK registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, ACB GAZSTROYB has conducted a highly risked credit policy related to the deployment of funds in low-quality assets.
The adequate assessment of the risks taken on the requirement of the supervisory body and the reliable reflection of the value of bank assets resulted in a credit organization of grounds for the implementation of bankruptcy prevention measures.
Furthermore, the credit organization was involved in the conduct of suspicious transit operations.

According to the reporting, the ACB ' s ACB ' s assets " GASSTROYBANK " at 1 August 2016 took 335 seats in the banking system of RF.
The londonian school girl who joined IHIL died in Syria
The Sultan Cadiza, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join IHIL, reportedly died in Syria.
The Tasnim Akunji lawyer stated that her family learned about her death in Raka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is expected that it was killed by a Russian air strike in Raka, a salary of grouping in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
Sultane was 17 years old, and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave a ruined country and return to England.
"It can only be hoped that the only advantage of all of this -- as the overgrave and the will of others -- is that these are the risks of traveling to a military zone -- to convince people to make the same choice," said Akunji.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other students from eastern London sat on a plane to Turkey and then bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family said that she married the IHIL fighter in Syria and became a widow for a few months.
Reed claims that Clinton will remain loyal to Harland as a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice in the event of the election.
The Leader of Democrats at the Senate, Harry Reid, said he was convinced that a democratic candidate to President Hillary Clinton would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if it was elected as President.
The Republicans of the Senate blocked Garland's approval, but as President Barak Obama nominated him in March.
The head of the majority group at the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next president will be elected by the man who can replace the last judge of the Supreme Court of Justice, Antonin Sculia.
Reed said at the conference bell on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland with some confidence.
Ms. Reed later said that he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether she was going to move Garland, and she was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn't want to "shoke the boat" with a new choice.
Harland is the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeal of the United States in the Colombian District.
Reid stated that the Republicans who blocked the nomination of Harland were the " advocates" and "persons" of the Republican candidate to the Presidents of Donald Tramp.
He stated that Tramp was not suitable for the post.
Treats states that erotic calendars for women, as well as for men
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellmer to light the calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli in 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they are targeted to find the next generation of top models for their calendar for 2017 with naked museums.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of naked models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I'm making it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
"We need to return to the demonstration of an eternal and classical naked figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of a female body," Shaw said in the press release of the calendar.
Women would like to be part of this project because it was a beautiful artwork.
Models can provide online or personal photos in open postings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscows will be given memories of unconscious Internet stores.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memorial that will tell us how not to be the victim of the Internet store.

The memorial is being completed to the present moment.
It will later be placed on the Rossenger Nadzor website on Moscow, also planned to release a print version and distribute to Moscows.

The New Book Network was punished for selling the book "50 days before my suicide."
The new book store network is punished for sale of Stace Kramer's book "50 days before my suicide," says the City News Agency Moscow.
As reported in the Rosseadviser, without examinating the penalty, the text of the book may be regarded as “provoking or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents”.
The Residual District Court reaffirmed the violation of the requirements for the distribution of information products to children and decided to appoint a penalty of 49 copies of printing products arrested by the Office of the Rosseur.
The source in the New Book confirmed that it was Stace Kramer's production.
In March this year, Moscow's largest book stores have been checked for the book "50 days before my suicide."
In Moscow, the Memorial of Ernst the Unknown will take place.
In Moscow, the Memorial of the Sculptor Ernsta Unknown will be held in the evening, TACS reported.
The event will be held on 15 August at the Central Literature House.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the unknown in the United States.
It was therefore decided to organize this evening for those who wished to mention it on their homeland," said the Russian Jewish Congress press.
It noted that this was important for the widow of Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
At the evening, close friends of the unknown, including poet Eugeneus Eutušenko, artist Boris Messerer, President of GMII, im. Pushkin Irina Antonova, director Mark Rosovski, as well as Minister of Culture, Vladimir Medinski, head of the Department of Culture of Moscow, Alexander Kibowski, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Printnik.
It was previously reported that the relatives of Ernst of the Unknown planned to conduct a panic on sculptor in New York, apparently, until 14 August.
The final consumer blamed: Who actually buys plates?
Lone men of mid-years love vinyl.
And until you have made the commentary segment with rough insults under the alias Non-Singled Men of Medium Years, this allegation comes from actual data.
YouGov said that so much of the renewal of plastics is not caused by a bum among generations of two thousand who want to invade a new material object and a nostalgia of average years.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a large share of probability are between 45 and 54, according to the data.
Furthermore, those who belong to the age group of 18-24 are at least likely.
This is also not just an act of assembly of lovers - it is emotional: the senior buyers of guilty are more likely to hold their feelings (56% against 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov faithful?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me while I would go down the center of Soho's live street, in a modest gray suit, and gestually before the stop, putting hands together and saying something kind of exciting, "Okay, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho’s heart slowly deprives its charms and dirt — hotels, cafeteria, Paperchas stores have now filled buildings, some of the music shops with fantastic specialists have been used once by independent sellers.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene where I am close to different people in some of these shops and try to evaluate their age and emotional attitudes through observation.
Glazgo Stuart, 55 years old I went from Sister Ray (recording of data: two young women, three medium-year-old men) to Reckless Records (the data account: eight men of average years, one woman probably aged 20 years), in London on noon to meet, and walking around the shopping to take a few hours.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These platelets of the above (he sent me an e-mail, I didn't pursue it to the house) go through the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such enormous quantities of albums and singles is partially from its available income: he can now buy plates that he couldn't afford when they had just left and buy the items he sold when he was young and incredible.
"Most of what I acquire is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, the things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably too young to buy," he said.
He agrees that those who buy plate, most likely, introverts who like their own company, add, "I don't smoke, I don't drink much.
It's my deficiency.
Wez, 25, who works in Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meet are in the YouGov profile.
However, he noticed the new wave of people under the influence of the medium noise, the people who heard of return and felt the obligation to buy their old plates.
According to the conversations I had, people have gotten rid of their collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Clients who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their compact discs to buy their plates," he said.
This could explain the boom among the resurrection of the guilty of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional importance of platelets?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store, like Phonica, to realize that plastic stores offer comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wes, some senior clients are particularly offended by the inadequate payment system.
Some guilty fans may feel shocked from the digital world and prefer to go to the continuity of familiar envelopes for platelets, objects that provoke memories of immediate adolescenthood.
"I think that it may sometimes be a filling of emptyness or possession of material things as a kind of calm," Wes said.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think many people have it too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We are like their social workers!" said a colleague from a plate.
The ICM survey in April showed that nearly 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album last month have not yet listened to it.
The survey also revealed that 41% of the players they have never used, while 7% of those who buy vinyls have no plates player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably seem seriously confused by scratching the scores with the bossano's collectors.
The trophy aspect of reborn is what Johnny, 42 years old, who works at Sounds of the Universe (the data account: three medium-year men).
"Someone came up recently and said, "I don't have a recorder, but I want to buy a Radiohead plate so we can put it to ourselves," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it's definitely happening.
More composing, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older, they're a little less than twenty people who just get to know that.
Fopp, who has taken nearly the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more variety of audiences when I arrive.
There are couples over 70, tourists who photograph, adolescent boys and women of mid-year-olds.
Although the atmosphere is less unnecessary than the above-mentioned shops -- the last synth and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvization, it is experiencing through the columns — it is nice to see the diversity in its clients.
None of them seemed particularly lonely, but a tormental psychological trauma was difficult to establish 30 seconds with someone.
Eleanor, 27 years old, walked on Fopp for a few minutes, considering the various platelets available in the sale.
She's looking at the goods, not wasting money.
She doesn't make much money, she said, so collecting platelets is not a very good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simply, but the beauty is guilty is ...," - it is flooded into dreams with a breath filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it is really incredible.
My last stop was a shop that, they say, contributed to a new generation of fans of guilty: City fashioners.
As long as I create an illusion that I'm looking at the jeans-betting shirts, I'm watching a group of teenagers gathering around the Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter begin to discuss the purchase of the Crosley player.
The left is the staircase, with the wall set by Adel, Jeff Buckley, Amy Wynnhouse and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory platelets for any medium collection.
No one watches — perhaps because they are just a decoration, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real art vinyl.
However, given that any attraction of attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho's depths for a while, there is almost nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that the layer of the population who has more probability than most have more time and money than most is the layer that spends most money on luxury items, such as guilty.
But while my findings show that the YouGov results are precise, at least in Soho's stores, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of women collectors and guilty fans that exist in reality, in plastic stores and online forums.
These people probably work everywhere at school or offices.
But they clearly do not spend the morning on Thursday, walking around the shopping of plates on the Berwick Street, slipping through the plates and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader who is hanging over the shoulders of no suspected men of the middle age.
Grenland’s Polar Shark — the longest spinal animal — video report
Scientists claim that the Greenland Polar Shark has the largest life-life of all the spinals on the planet.
Julius Neilsen, who studies these sharks, states that the female record was 272 to 512 years old and five meters long.
The French Court rejects the proposal to take down stores in the Jungley refugee camp
The French Court rejected the proposal of the authorities of Kala to take down dozens of shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial hearings this week, the authorities of Kale stated that the State should be able to take a total of 72 shops where people in the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, propose to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple foods for several euros in self-restaurants.
The prefecture of Kale stated that these places should be removed because they were a parallel economy that did not pay taxes and because they had fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups, told the Court that shops and restaurants were vital, claiming that free foods offered by the pro-governmental association and other groups did not give sufficient food for the increasing number of camps.
They stated that workshops and restaurants often provide blood and free food to those who need it.
The Court of Justice decided that there was no legitimate basis to expel people with 72 self-employment shops, but stated that the problems of the prefecture of Kale were "to be fully understood".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that bacalees, cafes and restaurants played a lot more than just feeding people who "have been living in extremely sharp conditions."
He said that spaces provided peaceful points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened to bring was the children's cafeteria of the Jungle Book at the camp, which is not working for benefit and offers 200 lunches per day, English and French classes and asylum consultations for hundreds of vulnerable minors without accompanying the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the child’s cafeteria.
The letter sent to Guardian stated that his closing would "be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not older than eight years old."
Two charitable agencies, Assistance to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants evaluated on Friday that the number in the Jungle camp increased and exceeded 9,000 people, the highest in all history, after the rapid increase of the new arrivals during the summer.
Micro-rayon libraries invite young free people to knowledge programmes.

Britain stops in silver at ragbi-7, after Fiji's Master Class allows them to take gold
The impressive series of Britain in Regby-7 was disturbed at the final obstacle by the Fiji team at the Final on Thursday night, when they were totally deployed by 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji was given a ball-class master, scattering, disposal, game support, run lines and rough force to win gold — their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came not too poorly in the form of silver, the third of Britain for a day, and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament on Regby-7 on the way to beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The sick beating of Box, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier the same day, could return to negatively affect them in the final.
But, despite anything, Fiji has won in such a form as a better team of 15 people.
This may be some comfort for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British will hang a gold medal tomorrow: Chief Coach Fiji - Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
It was a certain trip to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
They've only lost one here.
These strikes will hurt, but progress is impressive.
Fiji started greatly for fun, trying to take the ball to Britain.
It was like pushing on the bus column for Captain Tom Mitchell and company, and the world series champions went up to 5-0 when Osea Collinissau dived into the corner.
With four minutes on the watch, Gerrir Tuwai added another toadow on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great attempt of Mitchell's capture was to keep Leon Nakarv's man from killing the third, but it only detained Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua made a tachdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarava added one more after resuming and the watch was still more than a minute... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through a few more huge attempts of entrepreneurship of Britain and took a line to get a score.
Implementation led to 29-0 in a break.
It seemed like Fiji was born for the game of ragbi-7, while Britain was still captured by the work.
That there is a large degree.
Britain made mass substitutes for half the game, and they boosted the Fijian damb... for all four minutes, which, according to the standards of the first half, was good until Joshua Tuisov passed through after a few brilliant fidgian interactions.
Dan Norton took an attempt for Britain by making a tachdown in the left corner to make the account of 36-7, but the game was long on the way of the South Sea Islands, whose fans sang, waving flags and dancing on the tribunals.
It was impossible not to admire the full joy of the Fiji approach.
Mata William decorated a figi cake that did not need decoration, another attempt in recent seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and the Great Britain fell on the grass, totally defeated.
On the same day, Fiji defeated Japan from 20 to 5 in its half-final, and Britain had a little over South Africa in a tense half-final attempt to each one -- the difference in the British implementation.
Kyle Brown puts the Boxs forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, using some excellent work of his legs, broke the line and screwed under the heels in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to capture from Marcus Watson, the brother of the 15th side of England's team, Anthony, has won, and finally a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired of winning coach fighting cancer
There won't be more exciting gold in these games, and that's something.
From the first move to the last, 220 heavy rises in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who dragged the weaves, there were three votes in that boat, the eho of coach Robin Williams was always as long as they were trying to reach the second sequence of the Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the British sports analyses that reached such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, eventually their 39th invincible speech, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant sportsmen slipping around the surface with the elegance of the swans do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
At each gold, a battalion of ready hands that gradually contributed to growing victories, which are important, and no hands were more important than the coach's hands, who had been diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago, did not know if he would have experienced before seeing that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had a urine bubble cancer, which is one of the things they could operate, and they did.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
She's changing your kind of future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 in the intersession, keeping the graph breaking minimum if it could be the right expression in such circumstances.
I needed the payment, so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at once, even though they were talking a few steps.
That's how it starts.
It is a journey by itself, but it makes it a little more.
Their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual, trying to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, the captain of the Artillery Polk, with the service in Afghanistan behind the shoulders, said, "I was an emotional disturbance this week, maybe it's a little too much, but that means so much."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, as well as Robin.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nobody, so thank him very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose any race for five years.
This couple gives a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams started approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We've been a lot in the stage.
Helen said, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's very important not to get involved now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something amazing.
We didn't wait for the fireworks today, we just waited to get out and get out and win this race, which we did.
The couple will take a year to solve their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, on her own television searcher for Steve Bekshall's adventure.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I was the Olympic Champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government extended the destruction of sanctioned products
The Government extended the destruction of food prohibited to import to Russia until the end of 2017.
The appropriate decision was signed by Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, published at the official legal information portal.
The embargo on countries which introduced anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban has extended repeatedly, now acting until 31 December 2017.
Russia is forbidden to introduce certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, marine products, vegetables, fruits and breast products have been prohibited.
The use of the food imported into the country to the circulation of embargo is carried out in Russia since August 2015.
Only for I quarter 2016, about 100 tonnes of banned products were removed from sales.
Hunting the "Ban"

The WTO arbitral panel found that Russian imports on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import rates exceed the obligations made by Russia in the entry into the WTO.
"It is the first case when WTO has taken a decision against the RF," said the report on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators emphasized that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia ' s measures were " systematic " or " had a comprehensive nature " .
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties to paper and refrigerators soon.
This is said in the Communication of the Mineconomic Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intends to enter the World Trade Organization for Russia, which had introduced additional restrictions on Ukrainian goods transit.
This is said in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times stated that the United States behaviour undermines the principles of the discussion in order to address issues in the WTO.
Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other members of the WTO have made a similar statement because of the refusal of the Americans to endorse for the second time of South Korean Judge Chan Son Hwa.
Accordingly, Russia will not request WTO on Western sanctions imposed against RF.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now consists of 162 countries.
Russia joined her in 2012.
The President's administration has changed the manager
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, appointed the head of his own administration of the former Deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vino.
Vladimir Putin made changes in the President ' s administration and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and Kremlj.
In turn, Anton Wyno stated during the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work that he began to be head of the Administration of President Ivanov and promised to cooperate with the Government.
The Notifications previously stated that experts considered the situation with Sergei Ivanov resigned from the position of the manager of the transparency and understanding administration, and the change in the activities of the Kremlj administration would not be essential.
They note that the leader who had been working in the President ' s administration had been able to build the AP effectively.
Instead, the Deputy Head of Administration, Anton Wyno, a man who knows the specification of the work.
In Poland, they're not going to buy fuel from Gazprom.
The Polish oil company PGNIG does not exclude that a few years later the supply of gas from RF could become uneasy for it because of the reorientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was said by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Bogoslav Mažez.
His words are transmitted by TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy completely gas (in Gazproma), we are now diversifying our supplies.
In the next four years, the main supply directions for us will be the East, commodity from the PPP Terminals and Norway," said Mažez.
Gazprom is currently a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had put it nearly 5.3 billion cubic gas at 30 per cent above 2015.
The Russian gas huge share in PGNIG procurements increased to 49.8 per cent compared to 40 per cent earlier.
Recall that the Poland Anti-Monopolity Department did not agree on the establishment of a joint Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of gas pipeline, North Stream-2 on 22 July.
This month earlier, Poland left the Gazproma request for 11 billion cubic gas on the North Stream-2.
That was said by the Vice-President of the Government of Holding, Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the power of the North Stream-2 will be held in 2017, and in autumn 2016 the auction is planned for its cartridge.
At the end of May it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action on the intentions of the Polish party to renounce long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said Vice-Chairman Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Polands only increased by 42 per cent of the procurement of gas from RF.
In advance, Gazproma added that the fact that Polish PGNIG made a statement to the Stockholm arbitration court is not yet to stop negotiations.
Previously, the Polish company turned into a judicial institution to reduce the procurement price for Russian gas.
Recall, the authorized Government of Poland on gas and energy infrastructure, Peter Naimski, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to extend the gas contract with the Gazprom.
The Poland Contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expired in 2022.
In March, the authorized Government of Poland on gas and energy infrastructure, Peter Naimski, stated that his country could reject the supply of blue fuel from the east.
He said that Warsaw planned to build a new terminal for the burned Baltic Pipe gas, which would connect the country with the Norwegian Shelf.
The “North Stream-2” provides for the construction of two seawater threads of 55 billion cubic gas per year from Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission has increased the number of observers around the Ukraine border with Crime.
The first SMM heads in Ukraine, Alexander Hug, reported.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to the relevant issue of the journalists, transmitted " RIA News " .
According to OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crime was not fixed.
Observers monitored the three passage points through the Russian-Ukrainian border.
The video of the landing at the airport of Ufa a passenger plane, as-42, which drove outside the landing bar by 400 m and fell on the left wing.
The video was published by the 360 TV.
HP took place at 4.30 a.m. in Moscow.
The Aviation Airlines Crassavia has arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place where there were no victims.
The aircraft was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport is working in normal mode.
The SCM investigative management has been investigating the cause of a rigid landing of the aircraft.
UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in the areas held by the rebels in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All sides of the conflict deny the use of chloride, but the UN Special Ambassador on Syria, Stephan de Mistura, considers the fact that happened.
Such statements had been made before the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists launched an investigation on chemical weapons use in the Syrian town of Aleppo.
The first information on the toxic gas terrorism, apparently chloride, appeared on 2 August.
The opposition then stated that in the area where the Russian military-transported helicopter was struck before, the aircraft dropped bombs with poisonous substances, but in Moscow the charges were called a drop.
Later, the Ministry of Defence of Russia accused the hosting opposition group, Haraqat Nur, ad-Din, az-Zinky.
Soon it became known that toxic bombs were two.
This was confirmed by one of the victims of the BBC.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, started burning my eyes, it became difficult to breathe," quoted the eyewitness's word.
As a result of the attack, at least seven people died, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of the poisoning gas is confirmed by experts, action will be considered as a military crime.
The Special Envoy of the United Nations on Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said to journalists: " Proof that this really happened is a lot."
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is prescribed in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CHOP).
Although all sides of the Syrian conflict denied the use of toxic gases, human rights defenders identified 35 cases of the use of chloride by the Syrian army against the " moderate opposition" in 2015.
The situation in Aleppo complicates the fact that the shooting of its areas is being carried out daily, and terrorists prevent the exit of the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to set a humanitarian pause in military action.
The current daily three-hour consolidation regime is considered "insufficient to help nearly 2 million peaceful citizens trapped".
The Adviser of Staffana de Mistura on Humanitarian Affairs, Jan Egelann, stated that a 48-hour ceasefire will be required for the city of assistance and evacuation from there every week to the sick and wounded.
"We have to send volumes of trucks in the area where roads are practically destroyed and the remaining are minered," said Mr. Egelan. " But the Russian delegation confirmed the readiness to sit with us at the negotiation table."
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a humanitarian pause are ongoing.
As Russia opened humanitarian windows in Aleppo.
In the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, on 11 August, announced the introduction of a three-hour combating regime, which will act from Thursday.
The creation of humanitarian windows is intended to provide the conditions for delivery to the city of medicinal products, foods and items of the first need.
The decision of the Minister of Defence of RF was adopted on the basis of an increasing international pressure on Moscow with a requirement to reverse military operation and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiating process.
As a result of a series of explosions in Thailand, four people died.
Several explosions were exploded in the south of Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attacks, four people died, injured 19.
The explosion center came to the city of Hua-Hin.
There were ten aliens, four States citizens, no Russians among them.
None of the terrorist groups have yet taken responsibility for the incident, but the IMD of the countries has hurried to state that Islamists are not involved in it.
Several people have already been detained under suspicion of explosives.
According to the preliminary local police, the scale and specificities of the explosions indicated that they had been directed against the leadership of the military country.
The attacks took place on popular tourist courts, including the Patong beach in the area of Phuketa and the city of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat Tani.
After the military hunta arrived in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries demonstrating development.
In 2016, 14 million people have visited the country, which is 1.5 million more in 2015.
The first suspects for the preparation and organization of attacks have already been detained, informed Colonel Crissan Patanacaroen.
As soon as we talk about the goals, he added, however, in the IMD countries, they are “configured that they are not related to international extremist groups”.
Too early to make conclusions, said Mr. Patakaroen.
But we know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact, local diversions, and we are trying to establish the identity of those behind them.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Queen Thailand Sikrit.
Thai Hunta considers the protection of monarchy as one of its primary priorities, so the incident is likely targeted against it.
According to the statement by the General of the Police of Sitchia Shrispachardoenrat, the bombs were exploded remotely with a difference in half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on live streets filled with tourists in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four deaths was a Thai girl who deals with street food.
The figures of the remaining victims are not yet known, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign States.
According to the Thailand Royal Police, four German citizens, three subjects of the Netherlands, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of explosions, reports the Rosturism press service.
Local experts also link explosions to the referendum last 7 August, where 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the Constitution Commission designed by the military hunta.
The voter was required to determine whether they supported the system in which the upper parliament was fully appointed as military and had a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the parliamentary elections of 2017.
Recall, on 22 May 2014, a military revolution took place in Thailand under the leadership of the Priute Chan-Ocha army.
To this step, he said that the army had raised the continuing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
Military established the National Council of Peace and Order, introduced a command clock and censorship, disrupted the protesting and upper parliamentary chamber.
How Bangkok was in an emergency situation
The Government of Thailand, headed by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat, announced in January 2014 an emergency situation in Bangkok and the capital of the provinces.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, the Monument of the Conquest Centre of Bangkok, where one of the main protests, two explosions resulted in 28, five were critical.
Explosions produced unknown on motorcycles.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and attracted military forces to protect demonstrators.
In the Such Log, conditions have started to be developed.
The Government was invited to agree with the draft auction on the landing of the Suha Log with two key restrictions.
The auction is proposed to avoid companies where 25 per cent and more belongs to foreigners and those claimants whose capital will not be at least 25 per cent of the government.
Industries do not expect the Government to overwrite the conditions, noting that many players do not risk a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Government had introduced a draft order and conditions for the auction to the largest undeployed golden site in Russia in the Suho Log (Irkut region, stocks and resources of 130 million uncies), two sources of " E " known to the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday night, and one of them was clarifyed.
The Min приrodes confirmed " E " that the project was introduced to the Government.
The representative of the vice Prime Minister Alexandr Kloponin, who was in the council, said " A" that the project had not yet been entered.
"The auction may be announced in August, immediately after the Government's order, and taking into account the time limit for the collection of requests for potential participants (at least 45 days) of the tender can be held in October," the Min приroda said.
According to the E, the project maintained two key requirements for potential participants, as set out in the option to agree to the Ministries and FOIVs in July (e.g. E).
The first is the existence of at least 25 per cent of the State capital.
Second, the refusal of access to auction for foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on innovation in strategic society.
According to the two articles set out in the draft FZ, as already stated on 2 August, companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent and higher) are not tax residents of RF or have double citizenship.
The Government has the right to initiate such restrictions, as the Suha Log is of federal value (supplies more than 50 tons of gold).
The Min приrodes confirmed that the project " would contain restrictions to allow foreign companies " but refused to comment on the details before the Government ' s order.
The auctional capital requirement was raised by the Irkut area, said " E" in Minpride in December 2015, and later confirmed the Governor of the region of Sergei Levčenko, noting that it was addressed to Min приroda by his precedent Sergei Eroštenko, " having agreements on investment projects with "Rostech".
Who has lobbed the restriction on the permit of aliens, the interviewers " Y" do not clarify.
"But it is in the spirit of time: not to control the largest landing of gold in Russia on the basis of Western sanctions," said the interviewer "A" familiar with the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donsky, on 1 August, stated that aliens could " go to consortium" if the pretendents attracted them "as a financial structure, technical partners".
Interviewers " Y " believe that the government is unlikely to adjust the conditions.
The main pretendent for the Suha Log in the sector is the consortium of the largest golden producer of RF PAO PAO "Poles", the sulejman's son, Kerimov Saida, and the "Rostecha".
As the "Y" said in July, partners created the SL Gold, where the "Pole" had 51 per cent of the shares, in the RT-GR RT-49 per cent.
In the "Rostech" comments were denied, "A" said in "Pole " , " absolutely interested in this assets " and have all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be adopted after the announcement of the conditions," added Paulo.
The auction could be part of ALROSA, but the decision behind the RF Government was the sources of " A " .
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, developing assets in Chukotka, were not interested in the development of the Suho Logo, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the E, were not interested in assets.
The head of the Union of Gold Industrials RF Sergei Kashuba evaluated "Y" investments in the Suha Log in $2,5-4 billion in December 2015.
Most potential claimants are not only intimidating investments but also the complexity of the project: serious intelligence of stocks and technology with complex rudders, explained by the interviewers in the sector.
The largest M&A, the WHAI ' s Finance Pension Administrator, launched the process of unifying four subcontrol NPFs.
As a result, the accumulation of the NPF will create some 373 billion bucks on the basis of Gazfond Pensions.
On the launch of the procedure for the merger of four retirement funds, the WHAI, the Promagrofond, the Inheritance and the Gazfond Pensions, said yesterday the owner of 100 per cent of the OOO funds, the Financial Pension Administrator.
“Reorganization is carried out in coherence with the BC in compliance with the requirement of improving the conditions of existing treaties”, states the company ' s report.
The merger is held on the Base of Gazfond Pensions.
As the NPF director notes, Oleg Belosici, the unification of funds allows to address several challenges: the enlargement of the presence geography, the concentration of resources for development, the reduction of costs, the best practices of each fund and the optimization of corporate governance.
He said that the time limit for the completion of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF, Gazfond Pensions will become the largest player on the OPS market.
According to 31 March, the accumulation of retirement funds exceeded 373 billion rubs.
According to the reporting on the funds website, their owners ' beneficiaries, the “Financial Pension Administrator”, are now Anatolius Gabrielenko (with the controlled OOOs 65 per cent) and the Gazfond NPF (35 per cent).
However, the group itself had launched much later competitives.
So, the O1 NPF " Future" control group has swallowed "Stalfond" at the beginning of the current year.
This united NPF is currently joining the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
“Union into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to address structural tasks”, notes the NPF Director “The Future” of Nicolai Sidorov.
The active work on the consolidation of funds from April is also in the Safmar pension group - the European NPF, the Education and Science and the Regional Fund should be incorporated into the NPF Suffmar by the end of the year.
In 2017, the NPF ' s Trust will join them.
"The unification of funds will increase risk control, operational processes and costs," said the Safmar pension group.
The pause of the funds held by the “Financial Pension Administrator” may be caused by several reasons, indicated by experts.
Until recently, the NPF was unable to buy more than 40 per cent of the amount of infrastructure bonds in which the group had been actively placed.
Following the amendments to the decision of the CB in March this year, there are no longer such restrictions in accordance with a number of e-mailed regulator requirements.
If necessary, the whole issue can buy one large player," states the Director of the Financial Institute Group of AKRA, Yuri Nogin.
A number of NPF leaders from top-15 on assets call on another possible reason for a pause, as a result of the division of the scope of influence, and as a result, of the personnel assignments in a single fund that the owners of the group had to agree.
Yesterday, Anatolius Gabrielenko was not available for comments.
At the request of " Y" in the NPF Gazfond, they also did not respond.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour and inferior event, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
As the consultant-generator of the Pension Partner Sergey Okolesnov notes, Gazfonda Pension accumulation has less fluids, the accession will allow the stabilization of the other group funds.
This will require a better experience of the UNRF " Finance " and " Promagrofond " in the construction of OPC sales and the use of more modern POs.
The CB requirements for the processes and staff of the NPF are constantly increasing, so duplication of infrastructure in four funds with a single investment is inappropriate, considers the Director-General for Corporate Reviews " Expert RA " Paul Mitrophanes.
"The effect of reducing duplication functions will definitely cover the possible cost of association," said Mr. Mitrophanov.
The costs for the integration of the four Sergei Okolesnov funds are estimated at 30-50 million rubs.
"The expenses of four funds are approximately 400 million bullets per year, when consolidation in the medium-term prospect of the budget is actually reduced twice," Mr. Okolesnov is sure.
The Russian shopping was the best disney movie Pete and his dragon.
Beautiful New Zealand, a loving dragon, a traumatic history and songs in the style of contri, are enough to believe in old-fashioned magic, according to ELENA CROWCUN.
A frightened baby picked up a dragon that became a human baby and a gentle nanny and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of a puppy from the book of tales, plays with him in a chase and falls asleep.
Six years later, he was grown and bound, no longer distinguished from the other intelligent forest sorvance, Maugli.
In such a way, Pete discovers the red-headed woman Greyce (Brice Dallas Howard), while the Brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband, aggressively declines the forest.
Now she's gonna have to believe in the existence of a dragon, but also to help him save him.
Pete takes an accelerated course of being human in the surroundings of idilical Americans who carry cowboys' shirts, the moral code in their heart and smile more blind than in any advertisement.
No character does look and does not act too terrible to really hate or fear the observer.
Even Gavin, who was hunting an untipical resident of his forests far before an unreasonable evil man.
The huge pussy dragon has also become unsafe, with a good buldogue, airline wings and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon screams, screams, and, unfortunately, he doesn't say, but he's always wanted to be swallowed, so it's a good difference from all the famous kinematographic dragons.
Elliot’s visual illustration and his manner are so highly emotionally involved that, in the most tense moments, he starts to cry desperately in three rows, not only small viewers but also adults.
Amazingly good and minor Oaks Figley in Pete's role, breaking apart between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtually issued a canonical grandfather who would be pleased to have literally every child.
How did the director David Loury take a fantastic cute removal of the forgotten Disney Film, "Dracon Pete" in 1977, which was meant from his nose to the end of the tail and remembered only by the mix of animation and the game movie, and make it the most mental film this summer?
It's been a miracle that helped.
In his original picture, Laurie took only two things: orphanage Pete and dragon.
There are musical numbers behind the board and most of the strange jokes.
This good story reads the characteristics of the Bambi, the alien and many other sweet children's paintings.
The Disney Study continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality removals of the 21st century.
Of course, Pete and Dragon aren't so marvelously beautiful as the same "The Book of the Jungle" and there is no artificial evil man Kate Blanchett as a stepmother in the new "Zoluska".
This naive film, however, helps to believe in miracles and good in best disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to the Disney Castle will be receiving the director of Laurie for the artistic film-adapthation of the story of Peter Pene.
A new ambitious project on a grown-up boy on James Barry's one-minded story was made by David Lawrey and Toby Halbrooks.
A new accusation to the RBK Alexander Sokolov
Advocates of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of the organization of the extremist structure, stated that the prosecutor had found insufficient in the case of their defence.
The fact that the prosecutor made this show, we learned from investigators literally yesterday.
We have been scheduled to participate in the judicial meeting on limitation of the awareness of criminal materials, but the meeting was not eventually held, and the investigators informed us of the presentation by the prosecutor's statement," the BCC said to the lawyer of Olga Dinze.
She stated that the prosecutor had indicated that investigators were incompatible with the qualifications of the case and collected materials.
The investigators will now have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and make Alexandr Sokolov a new accusation.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (UK) will appear, or will remain the same, but with other evidence and new evidence, Ms. Dinze has been clarifyed.
As the " Y" reported, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June, it was reported that the result had been excluded from the accusation of the journalist of the RBC of the formulation of " dissolving the political environment against instability" and "revocation of power in an illegal way".
A reporter of the Commersantuboscosport, ALEXANDR ZILBERT, lived an Olympics in the Olympic village, inspected the home of the Russian meeting, lunched in the local dining room and even passed the WADA test after that.
It doesn't seem like life's going away for a second.
Even at night.
The latest starts sometimes end at midnight, and then the sportsmen need another hour or two to return to the Olympic village.
Furthermore, the settlement and eviction of the village are being conducted without delay, since some athletes have completed their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, are only coming here.
Well, at 7:30, the heads of all the Olympic delegations are dragged in one of the temporary shoes.
In these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues,” says the head of the Russian Olympic Delegation of the Russian Igor Kazikov team. - Despite the fact that the house in which ours were placed, consider that the sample was given to one of the first and demonstrated to all the inspectors, even in it, there are some nonsense.
Well, with a hot water problem, I'm sorry, with the toilets.
We've been fighting for cleanness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinners started coming, but they're just screwing some kind of substance on the floor, and that's all.
They've got poles, you see, some innovation.
Moll, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these floors. The laminate is normal.
In general, the Clining Company's changed, and now it's okay.
The Olympic village is such South Boothovo, a bedroom area frozen on the one side of the mountains, the other is an impressive wreck, the water-based areas.
Well, for security, there is still a two-foot iron fence that walks along.
In the village, up to 17,000 people can be placed in 3604 apartments in 31 house.
One of the 18th floors is hanging a huge Russian flag, which is fully dedicated to our meeting.
When you look at a small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems may be the most vital for the country team.
There are two announcements on the registration station: "Please don't throw a paper into the bathroom!" and "Prime a gift of a badge.
The stone itself drowns in the tracts.
Their cheerful flower contrasts with the titles of the brochure: "The Memorial of Infectious Diseases for Rio de Janeiro", "Their first help in drowning, infection of a non-born body in breathing paths, loss of consciousness is a stage of heart-level reanimation," "The first aid in burns, warm strike, fractures and bleeding."
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, "The infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
Nevertheless, there is no good outcome for all.
Of course, there is a medical centre in Russia, which is at any time ready to provide qualified assistance to the inhabitants of the house, including a relaxing and sports massage.
On the contrary to the medical center, our delegation's headquarters.
Beside the door, the inspiring poster, "We'll win, we'll win!"
And, of course, the verses:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear them believe in them.
Let the less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, the Russians do not retreat, not break!
And for the greater elevation of the spirit, the announcement is: "Dear brothers and sisters!
On the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and the entire Russia of Cyrilla, the spiritual care of the sportsmen of the Olympic College of Russia is carried out by the protoyers of Andrey Vladimirovic Alexeev.
Requests and other requirements are available on the phone...
In fact, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religion for All Religions in the village.
Well, the Russians, in the privileged position, have their own clock.
With regard to the loading of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs that is recommended to use during the fire.
And in the darkness, he stumbled about the bodies on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping collaborators of a new Clining Company.
I believe, at any time, they decided to lay down their innovative fields in order to set a quiet time right on the cold steps.
At the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with a long friend, Vitali Fedorovich Dubko, coach of our batutists, leading them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his teenager, Jana Paul’s champion of Europe, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
There's nothing to complain about, but it's not critical.
Sanuzel is one in four, but it's space.
The closet, of course, is funny, from the tissue, doesn't cause confidence, but things can be put on.
"No, you're pretending that they're done with tea!" - the tennisman, Lightlan Kuznecov, who met me in the main dining room.
It is called the main, at least because it represents a space of 2.7 thousand square m and is ready to accept 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There's 60,000 bucks out on the top of the day for free.
The options of the menus are: "Best of Brazil", "Pears of Peace", "Asian dishes" and "Pice, macaron products".
The latest option, as I looked at, has been used by the great popularity of our volunteers.
I didn't find soups in any of the giant restaurants.
What are the soups?
It's good that I took the Chinese with me, the cook.
And a tea pig.
But in general, for you to understand, we've got a lot worse food on the ship.
There's something you can choose, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I personally picked a fever for a couple and a tomato sauce.
There is a table with the name in three languages: English, French and Portuguese, as well as the food value of the product and the existence of allergens.
Well, it's been pretty good to confess.
I don't even understand why this turn is worth all the time in the local McDonald's.
Wet, relaxed, can be said "heat" sportsmen at the exit of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're deceived by a triumphant victory, with a shirt.
They're provoking, you can say!
To get a gift, you need to answer at least eight questions from ten.
There are some questions in Russian! - the WADA virgin attacked me.
But I didn't attack it.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic strike, of course.
The situation has already increased on the second question, "If I have received a notification of the doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?"
I stopped at option B, "No, I have one hour."
I lost, like, awake.
Forgot that WADA doesn't have any weaknesses to be expected.
Anyway, we need to show up right now.
Well, at the seventh stage of Victorina, my situation has become critical.
I thought somehow that if I would be difficult to keep a balanced diet because of my weighty schedule (and me, by the way, hard!), I could use bio additives to get "supplementary nutrients to improve my productivity".
No, they won't!
More specifically, the response was formulated so that it was not categorically forbidden, but was urged, in several proposals.
It's not fair to play WADA!
What's up, Russia?
It's nowhere behind Ethima, Isinbaeva and all of our bloody team.
So I focused on the last, and I won the unfortunate shirt.
Know how it says, ours!
In a victory mood, I went to the gym center in the neighborhood.
He's inclined in the training account.
It's 250.
It was surprised that no Russian sportsman had been found in the accumulation of russian tracks.
But maybe it's right.
Let someone who can't play is trained!
There was one of our boys sitting in the nearby polyclinic.
In the occulist's row.
Don't worry, no shooter.
In the polyclinic, however, as in the village, wherever the swimming is, there is a condom extradition apparatus.
It draws an encouraging call: "Fare with the condom!"
It remains only to rotate the iron that resembles the hand of the door castle, and the condoms made from the natural Amazonian lattex willingly fall out of the apparatus.
I took myself alone, to remember.
The sportsmen won't do it, they've got 450 grand.
Just for the holiday and celebration of the Olympic village, there is a whole entertainment center.
In any case, an acquaintance table recalls that the International Olympic Committee has spent $3.25 million a day in various ways.
The Centre is flooded with video games, billards and tennis tables, football and hockey tables and some strange devices similar to video trainers.
What is this? - I'm interested in a companion in the form of a Ukrainian toy that actively uses a wild toy.
Of course, you could just say that he doesn't want to talk to a person in the form of Russia's assembly, yes, and all.
By the way, there's some strange gaining of circumstances in the eyes of the boys in yellow and blue.
The most playful gathering, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to go around the village, looking into every corner of it.
But if you do not walk on electrical drives, you will be opened up with a Canadian house with salmon at the entrance and a tent with a reconstruction bath, and a ticket office, and a wash, and a cleaning machine, and a feather, and a flower store, and a store with goods of daily consumption, and an e-mail with unique marks (only you can't wait for a row from Chinese philatelists), and a bank, and a bureau of findings, and a photokiosk.
Later in the evening, you will sit next to the olive tree hanged with different color tapes in the memory of those who have left this world with friends and relatives of athletes.
And you're going to be under the accommodation of a car that is unconditionally dissolving liquid to kill insects, thinking about eternal.
I mean, the Olympic Movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world kept breathing watching the Australians almost punish the American Dream Team, the true fans went into the network.
Not a lot of people know that the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in rape at the XXXI Olympic games, I got first.
Maybe I'm even the only Moscow who saw it happening, without counting on those who saw the Carioca competition that night.
Only a real cheerleader can understand that.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
The neighbours from the bottom, as always at night, wake up and start waking, but very loud to scream at each other.
And threatening to move the furniture.
There's no time for the crane to go to the market and buy, as asked by the wardrobe, a new one.
There's nothing understood in the television schedule, so I was just keeping the Match channels controlled, the First and in any case "Russia" -- even though it's almost meaningless.
"Russia" is a family of repeats, the whole sport is in a record.
It's where the series are broadcasting.
Hope, of course, for "Match" -- the whole evening a young man shouted in the news releases first about the great semi-final of Deriglazova -- Shanaeva, then about the coming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, U.S. basketball--Australia.
By the way, I can't say anything wrong about this decision.
The Australians were equal, the first half of them won.
They've been placed out of their own size of Americans.
As a result, they have lost, but as it is now expressed, the basketball olympic tournament will no longer be former.
It's all good, but it's nearing the fight with Dee Frances, and on the screen, it's no change.
I'm starting to lift the channels in a light panic.
That's the way it feels, the second time they turn around.
All right, let's go deep, get the cables.
There's no match on any of thematic Mothers.
And, in my feelings, the fight is about to begin.
The text and tweeting of some sports sites aren't good for me.
The road surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
The First web site appears to have a direct technical transmission of all competitions that are being carried out at this time.
I'm calling for a fight, I get a fight for gold.
Deriglaza is greatly counteracting, going forward in the glasses - and it's obviously starting to take time.
The Italian plays almost the whole gap.
Ours is one point ahead, up to the end of almost two seconds.
Dee Francesca is thrown on the Deriglazov, and it departs, the time ends, the Italian woman is injecting.
Victory!
In a few seconds, the Olympic messenger on the phone reports about the fourth gold medal.
Apparently, I'm the first one who saw it with my own eyes.
Intelligent, faithful, involved.
The spiritual governance of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan denied the use of Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, DUM pledged his communities to preach Fridays only in tatar languages to make young tatars “to learn their own language”.
The Office claims that it is "no harming" the rights of muslims of other nationalities.
In some machetes, Casani finds that the tatar language is not understood to 60 per cent of the people, including foreign students, migrants and tatars themselves.
Mys are afraid that their tatar preaches will not come to the entire audience.
Yesterday, the Doom of Tatarstan unanimously decided to conduct Friday preaching in the mosques of the Republic only in the tatar language.
As Tatarstan's muffit Camille Samigulin said, this should be an incentive for young tatars to learn their own language.
"For those who say "weighed" we intend to organize tatar language lessons absolutely for free," Mr. Samgulin promised.
He added that "decision has already entered into force" and today, in all the swords, the preaching "must be already in the tatar language".
He reminded Tatarstan's DUM issued the Schura magazine with typical preaching in tatar language.
I have, who speaks not well in Tatar, "may be prepared according to it."
DOM of Tatarstan combines over thousands of revenues in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to muftia, Friday preaches are conducted only in the tatar language.
At the same time, a number of machetes in Kazani used most Russian.
In particular, as the mufty indicated, it was practiced in the Burnay Machete, Zaccupied and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhammadshin stressed that the leadership was a task to ensure that all students had both public languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"None of the Muslim Netatars can be said," said Mr. Muhammadshin, explaining that the preacher itself is "not a necessary, primary part of the massage."
At the same time, it will continue to be read in Arabic, and the mathematics will continue to be lectures and lessons in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Muhammethin said "A" that there was no serious threat of tatar language expelled from swords.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajiqi, are not used in the prophecies in the Republic.
The DUM decision was actively supported in the World Congress Committee of Tatar (WCT).
The head of the WCT Rinat Zakirov said "A," "Machetti is an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the tatar language had gone from this sphere.
He noted that preaching in the tatar language was “the desire of the haves themselves”, but in the WCT's communities, “their will be considered to be right”.
Inquired " Y" havemas who were in Russian who were ready to fulfil the DUM decision, but they believe that they would be difficult to understand the clergy.
The mosques are both tatars and Russians.
Many don't understand the language.
Of course, they'll be sad.
"We'll have to reconstruct," said the Burnay Mosque of Farhat Mavletdinov.
He said that the preaching in Russian is closer to many tatars, since “the Russian and in schools and in children, the radio is everywhere. ”
However, he believes that the machete can continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held in other days.
We rely on Allah.
Allah will show a way out of this situation."
But about 60 percent of us don't know the tatar language.
These are Uzbeki, Taddies and Azerbaijans.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"Therefore, we've been four years moving into Russian," said I.
He believes that in the Tatar language, the preachers will "go to the narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience."
But we will obey the decision of the captive.
It's just the result of the preaching will be different.
But time will show.
"For example, it will only be easier for me, because the tatar language is my family," Gabdullah Galiullin concluded.

The Russian copper company (RMC) is ready to take social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by renewing the RMC for the modernization of one of the most old and environmentally dirty enterprises of the country, the Karabasian Mediterranean Combine.
The Karabasian Mediterranean Factor was established by the English shareholder society, headed by Leslie Urcvart in 1910.
At the Soviet time, it was an industrial enterprise that was important to the economy of the country, and it actually ensured the viability of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, production had been stopped because of financial problems, which resulted in serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, a decision was taken to resume the work of the Karabas Mediterranean Combine.
One of the main problems of the Karabash factory was also needed to be addressed - environmental.
By the beginning of the 2000s, Karabas was sadly known as an area of environmental disaster.
The situation in Carabashmidi began to change in 2004, after the company was headed by the Russian copper company.
The company began to modernize production, which has gradually reduced environmental burdens.
It was recently noted by the Governor of the Chelabin area, Boris Dubrovski, who visited in the first numbers of July, Carabashmid.
The head of South Ural referred to great changes that have occurred with the company since the "Crabashmid" became a group of RMCs.
The main event for the modernization of the Carabashmedi has been the construction of a new sulphur acid tube that allows to catch up to 99.9 per cent of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Copper Company, the amount of investment in the project was approximately 7 billion.
The next phase of the modernization of the C.O. " Carabashmid " is the reconstruction of the converter.
The replacement of three converters, smokers, gasway tracts is scheduled at the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2,5 billion rubs.
Furthermore, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new cleaning price of 1 billion bucks.
In turn, taxes to the city of Karabas will also be raised.
During the full time of implementation of the Tominian GOCA project, from the beginning of construction and prior to the second row, the federal penalty will be received by 8.9 billion rubs.
And after the introduction of the GOCA in the operation of the taxes to all levels, it could be 80.9 billion rubs.
During the year of production in the Varenian region, the budgets of various levels were listed by 346.3 million rubs.
And that's the first year.
"The longer the company works successfully, the amount of estimates may be greater," added Valerius Ulanovski.
In the RMC, tax accounts from the Micah GOCA were closed to 1 billion rubs in 2015.
However, the participation of RMC in life and the development of their territories is not limited to tax deductions.
RMC companies help to repair and contain schools, gardens, sports facilities, to build cultural and entertaining facilities, to promote territories.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabash was capital repair, and in fact almost a complete restructuring of the N9 child garden to 95 instructors.
The building built in 1960 was in an emergency situation.
Also, in the territory of the RMC Arena, a landscape park with artificial ponds, underground and surrounding parkings will be placed on 600 machines, cafes and sports stores.
The RMC of Arena will allow the international international sports activities to be performed.
But the main objective of this project is to make exercises with physical and sports in comfortable conditions available to the Chelabinski residents, primarily for children.

WSJ: The United States is considering the introduction of sanctions against RF due to the invasion of democratic servers.
Officials of the United States are considering the introduction of new sanctions against Russia in response to the invasion of the Democratic Party servers, wrote the Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
For sanctions, the U.S. Administration of President Barak Obama must officially accuse the attack on Russian servers or supported by the Russian hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other US specials are practically convinced of the involvement of Russia in cyber-attack.
WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to indicate namely those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exemption consists of the invasion of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database in 2014, which was officially liable to the CNDD.
However, last year, Obama issued an order to simplify the introduction of sanctions against those who carry out or contribute to cyber attacks.
It was initially directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision on sanctions may be long, according to the publication.
Even if the officials concluded that the hackers had acted with the support of Russia, before the decision to disclose information would have to increase the possible implications.
They need to determine whether the event was so serious that it had caused bilateral tensions.
It was previously reported that Barak Obama's administration allowed sanctions against the State whose hackers broke the servers of the Democratic Party's National Committee.
The WikiLeaks website published an e-mail of the National Democratic Committee.
The media reported that the hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in a breach.
In Cremle, such communications have been called absurd.

The Effect of Anime Snapchat is criticised as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anonymous, but some viewers say it is racially intact.
With the Linza Snapchat tool, approximately 150 million users per day are able to change the reality and play with individual ways that are limited to absurd.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, a dog or a character to make Roy Liechtenstein a picture.
The lenses are rough, screwing instruments that create more than 30 million corrected selfs per day.
Any mistakes are rapidly known.
The Snapchat lenses were criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of the person or encouraged white persons as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered this week with a lens that gave them hairy eyes, curve teeth and cheeks, some criticists viewed it as a racist cartoon of Asians, the "yellows".
They were wondering whether these repeated contradictions indicated the more serious problem of the diversity company.
On Wednesday, the reports and regrets were distributed on the Verge and Motherboard report, the next day after Snapchat declared that they had removed the function.
The company commented: the lense was designed to respect the characters of animation, not as an Asian cartoon.
But for experts who know about racism, the lenses reminded of insulting stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected comparison with anonymous.
In the e-mail of Grace Sparapani, a Korean art student whose Twitters were actively shared, said that the lens was "insulting and at least uncomfortable".
She added that "has been difficult to compare side by side of a very rough drawing on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellows, but to the highest degree destructively yellows.
Snapchat is not the only company through these cultural bridges.
The American culture seems to be involved in an endless fight for diversity and inclusiveness, starting from corporate halls to Hollywood and the devils that we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- who are more racially different than their older generation -- may mean that they are more likely to wait for understanding.
When one of the Snapchat lenses creates an insulting image for the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, Cathy Zhu said, "The course of events is much harder to remain unnoticed as it was before."
On Thursday, Jou, the manufacture manager and the engineer who worked for the Medium, decided to remove its account in Snapchat and encouraged others to do the same.
In the Medium and telephone interview, she said that racial contradiction was caused by insufficient diversity in the collection of staff in Snepchat.
I've criticized the primarily white leadership of the company, consisting only of men and finishing its article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu wrote, who is the American of Chinese origin, "If there were no sufficient numbers of people in the state that could make such decisions, either they have a white man, but they do not take the positions where they can be safe and open to speak."
Other viewers shared her view, expressing displeasure that Snapchat did not answer most of its questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state by emphasizing its private company status.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but, according to the trusted person, the company recently hired a recruitor to focus on the insufficient layers of the population and on active attempts to involve internal resources.
On her own, Jow said that she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that this is not going to work."
Military Guide distorted the I.I.L. Investigations, reports the Congress Commission
Officials from the United States Central Armed Forces have modified intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than to give grounds for the event on the ground, the Congress Commission reported on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Republican Chairpersons of the Committee of the Committee of Representatives of the WC, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Provision Subcommittee found “widely widespread dissatisfaction” among the Headquarters' Intelligence Services of the Headquarters, which argued that the leaders had controlled their assessments of American action aimed at winning the Islamic State.
The central command known as Centcom is the main military office in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence documents approved by the High Command of Centcom generally gave a more optimistic picture of United States anti-terrorism action than confirmed by real data from the scenario, and were stablely optimistic than the analysis provided by other specialists,” said the report.
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the superior leadership appears to be untrusted, our troops suffer," said a member of the Chamber of representatives of Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The problem with the leadership of the Centcom is the top of the organization.
The ten-party report detailed the underrecords that arise constantly in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American action aimed at training the Iraqi armed forces provided by the Headquarters.
While it does not contain final evidence that members of the Obama Administration had ordered to fake reports, he claimed that the analysts felt that the leadership of Centcom had them to present a more optimistic view of the threat by the Islamic State, also known as IIL or ISIL.
"In the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony of the Headquarters in the Congress were much more optimistic than real events," the report reported.
For example, the Officer of Centcom publicly stated that the major military attack to return Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is certainly known," the member of the Chamber of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, the Republican from Kansas, said.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence intelligence service of the United States Central Command has been fake intelligence documents to reduce the threat of IAIL in Iraq.
The Republicans established an operational group when they learned that the analysts expressed anxiety that the examination of the Islamic State was fake.
As the investigation is promoted, the report published on Thursday will follow more exploited data.
Further, the investigation of the Centcom investigated is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
The representatives of the Democratic Party at the U.S. Intelligence Chamber Committee published their own data on Thursday, which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican operational group.
" Between 2014 and 2015, Centkom has established a excessively closed intelligence assessment procedure for IRIL and Iraq ' s security forces," said in the statement by the member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Shiff, the chief representative of the Democratic Party in the Committee.
This procedure, according to Shiff, has “inhibited the issue of intelligence documents”, damaged the moral state of analysts and “insufficiently reflected distinct views”.
But Shiff and Democrats claim that they have not found evidence that the White House has tried to force Centcom's analysts to bring them to their imprisonment under “consulted or political interpretation”.
The preliminary results of the Congress investigation were presented on Tuesday by the Portal of The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Chief Inspector Pentagon, opened after analysts of Centkom.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress until the main inspector was investigated.
But he said that "experts sometimes distinguish in views in the tracing of integrated data, and the Special Services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a healthy dialogue on these vital topics relating to national security."
The consequences of the investigation are beyond the question of whether the target of the American bombing in Iraq and Syria (as more representatives of the Ministry of Defence are now claimed).
However, last year's statements raise doubts whether President Obama could be trusted that the Central Command provided true military assessments in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of investigated on the Islamic State repeats the disputes that had occurred more than ten years ago, when the Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article in which it claimed that the administration of President George Walker Bush, due to the protest of many analysts, had spoken in support of a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think of what would follow the invasion of 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, the Hooker team concluded that, despite the public statements of the opposite, the aviation crashes on oil race plants belonging to the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration of the financial situation of the terrorist group because it built temporary oil-traffic factories to sell oil on the black market.
But the opening was not distributed outside the Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many deputies considered to be an excessively optimistic assessment of war.
General Austin resigned in April and was placed in the Headquarters of Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins 4 times in a female hockey on the grass, thus approaching the decisive struggle with Britain
On Thursday, Katie Bam opened the first two goals for the US female hockey team on the grass when the Americans won the Indian team with 3-0.
Five heads in two games should be a memorial achievement, but Bam, aged 27, claims that she was not sure if she had ever done something like this.
"I don't use my mind," she said.
I'm not really the people who track their goals.
This is what she knows: the Americans account is 4-0 at the Olympic Tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after the loss of Japan on Thursday.
The British and United States teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first tour.
The two teams are pretending for the fourth final, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their six teams and who the second.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of rivals from the Netherlands, leaders of another group, a little weather when the fourthfinal games begin.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans made a noise here by their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams in the London games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took a hockey stick on the grass when she was 3 (her senior twin sisters played this kind of sport in Drexel) and joined the national meeting at the age of 16 years and became her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympiade when it did not run a final tour.
Then came 2012, when she and her teammates were in disagreement.
The next year, Coeig Parnham, was appointed a coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the productivity that we have now.
We have changed our views completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with an uncomfortable hand on a short distance.
India came to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself to be surprised and maintained the 1-0 account until the end of the third period when Bam took its initiative.
She made a long passage with the ball down to the left side of the field, then went into the middle of the spiral and sharply sent the ball to the gate, thus giving the Americans the advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The win was the first tournament for the U.S. gateman, Jackie Briggs, who passed a single goal in each of the first three victories.
She's in a hit.
Like Bam.
"We are in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how good it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the middle of the Olympic Games 'Day' jumps on the batute
Wherever you are, no matter how much time it is, it's the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro seem unchanged and inevitable, which is a mad combination of competition and pursuits.
It's like the Olympic Fire itself and it's the burning torch that is transferred from the shooter to the swimming, to the gymnast, to the triatlonist.
You can't turn on television, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbors in a queue and not hear about Simone Byles, Cathy Ledeca or the hostility between Michael Fellps and Chad de Cloe.
There's also Logan Dooley.
The Douli, the first part of the Olympic Games, a beauty with jams on the cheeks, could be among the famous ones shown in the Prime Time, which are promoted by sponsors and life-affirming advertising films, if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a swimmer.
But a 28-year-old Douli from Lake Forest in California fights for gold in the Olympic jumping jumps.
The Olympic Fire does not enlighten all the events in the same way.
Further than the center, partly in the shadows, there are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from a lung gun, shooting from the bow, badminton, thekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I'm gravely allowed to speak to protect my personal addiction, allow me to pay your attention to the modest score of jumps on the batute.
Although the batute jumps were a olympic sport since 2000, when they debutted in Sydney's games, in the past 16 years, they received so little confession that many of the people I asked were not aware that they were at all referring to the Olympic sports.
This may be regional ignorance.
While the United States were sending sportsmen to competition, they had never won medals in batute jumps, and their sportsmen hadn't come to the final until 2012.
China and Russians usually share male prizes, and Chinese and Canadian women.
Dun Dunn from China and Rose McLennan from Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But the batute jumps have an outsajder charm, in particular because the undeveloped ear is more associated with a circuit college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I must admit I'm not an expert, I'm just a landed enthusiast.
They really have a comic potential — a cartoon mitigation of infinite jumps — but also the excellence of gymnastics and jumping into water, two types of sports that they mostly combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolin", which means "tramplin for jumping into water."
Pretendents are jumping on a giant batoo, flying to the air nearly 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (flippings, squirrels and saltos) until the final landing on their feet.
They are evaluated by the implementation, complexity and " flight time " in accordance with the official Olympic Games Programme.
Thirty-two sportsmen from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
Pretendents must go on, faster, higher, and higher in the hunting of gold, sometimes to the end, and sometimes toward and forward, to the field.
They strive not only to the final or starting wall but also to the television camera, to another irritating abroad: the world or the Olympic record.
This stubborn desire is noble, delightful, even fanatic — and it is sufficient to make even the viewer crawl.
But, I think, it's a little tired when you see the Games.
He's got a break on the batute.
Batutist's direction up.
Moveing forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, seeming like astronaut, flying up, then down, then without effort again.
Of course, they do not work without competitiveness or difficulties, but there is no crazy zeal for the end, no jumping long, but a strange, delicate disappearance of time and gravity during the entire programme.
It's the most closest of the day of the Olympic sport.
Women's qualifications, and then the final will take place on Friday day, broadcast at an hour of eastern European time; men on Saturday, also at an hour.
NBC will translate the final in the daily programme from 14:00 at both days.
A calm, beautiful moment is expected in the middle of the olympic madness, which can be easily viewed in a common trash.
And if consciousness growth can only be achieved by subjecting men's sportsmen to the desired views and objectives, as according to Wall Street Journal, recently suggested by the men of the United States, Douli only awaits his new admirable fan crowd.
The generation protests in Ethiopia, an old United States Alliance
Anger protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia faced the irritating opposition of the Government.
The witnesses say that dozens of protesters were deadly wounded during the conflict with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the edge of the fracture?
In the last decade, she was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong West ally with a rapidly developing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-governmental protests have shaken the country by spreading its increasing numbers of territories.
Only in the last week, thousands of people were out of the streets, demanding radical political changes.
The Government ' s response was cruel, according to human rights defenders.
The witnesses claimed that police officers shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos from the protest sites, allegedly taken at the end of the past or at the beginning of this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they were put on the wall.
The United Nations Officer on Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country from falling, and it would continue to be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, chairman of the African Rog project in the international research group.
Ethiopia is the second dense country of Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing with an impressive speed.
Her infrastructure has improved significantly — even a new suburb train in Addis Abeba capital.
Her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia had not been a model of democracy; human rights organizations were constantly referred to government repressions - the opposition in the territory of the State was crossed, because dissidents were actually silent.
Many of them were expelled, imprisoned, killed or expelled to remote deserts.
But it can change.
"If people are constantly suppressed and not abandoned other options than protesting, the rebellion will rise," said Seyum Teshome, a preacher of the university in central Ethiopia.
All youths protest.
The generation protests.
The complaints are numerous, starting with land use, ending with the overwhelming of the government's coalition.
Following the widely criticized elections last year, the Government Party and its allies have completed their opposition and have now controlled 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, the tension along the border with Eritrea is growing; the fight for this uncertain, disputed border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, which have been destroyed over or less in recent years, such as the Front of Oromo's release or the Front of National Liberation of Ogaden, may try to use anxiety and rearmage.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, a few years of depth, are now exploding.
The first seemed totally harmless: smartphones.
Only in the past few years, a large number of Ethiopians had been able to communicate in social networks because cheap smartphones had become common and the Internet service has become better.
Even when the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through the proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they were organized for protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, two largest ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
During the centuries of Amhara, many of whom are Muslims and live in low-level regions have prospered in politics and business.
But this is also changing.
"We will act together at one beginning," said Mulat Hemech, leader of Oromo.
The greatest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tiger, which is about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, had fulfilled the responsibility of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia in 17 years, until he died from unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could predict danger.
Analysts argue that he had been particularly skilled with the first dissatisfaction signals and used investigators to obtain data and discontinue opponents.
"The current regime lacks healthy sense," said Abdi, analyst of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hajlemariam Desalen, appeared from nowhere and took the seat of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was born from the region of Tigray in northern Ethiopia, heilemariam is a Southern.
Analysts say he does not use the security service controlled by Tiger.
Many fear that this will lead to further bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such anxiety in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what, as the analysts said, were the elections that the Government had fallen down and then fake results.
During subsequent repressions, many Protestants have been killed, although in a smaller quantity compared to the last months, and this period of worries has passed relatively quickly.
The development experts expressed appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for the long-sight development of infrastructure, such as the new intergrading train and significant progress in combating poverty.
But it was obvious that this did not stop the growth of internal dissatisfaction by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, the protesters in Gondar, the city in Amhara, attacked the companies belonging to Tiger and the anti-Tyger hatred in social networks became comprehensive.
The analysts claim that protesters put the United States and other Western allies in an uncomfortable situation.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over the neighbouring Somalia, although it recently declared that it closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wishes to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not wish his ally to lose power in the already unstable region.
"And it will be hard to go through this rope," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explained his statement that IHIL was founded by Obama, "sarcasm"
Donald J. Tramp tried to replace the last conflict covered by his pre-electoral headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when several times this week he claimed that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were " founders" of the terrorist grouping of the Islamic State.
The clarification raised new issues regarding the ability of a candidate to be president from the Republican party to address the American people.
It also placed his deputies who tried to protect him during the period of anxiety, in an uncomfortable situation, since they had to explain the words that he probably did not mean.
With this assumption at a meeting on Wednesday night, Tramp strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating the interview that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton had founded IHIL.
But on Twitter's post early Friday morning, Tramp wrote that he was just a nursery.
This post was a direct contrast to the allegation made just a day earlier, when Tramp said in several interviews that it was absolutely serious in his accusation.
When the radio-conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Tramp mitigate the statement, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy IGIL, the candidate for the President of the Republican Party did not use the opportunity.
The last scandal struck when Tramp tried to reorient his campaign on the economy in the light of the reduction of rating.
Tramp and Clinton spoke with competitive talks on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Tramp tried to return to that subject again.
Once again came to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to increase taxes, and said that it was boring.
Tramp used sarcasm before as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he had put a general criticism on himself, he practically said that the Russians should break the Clinton e-mail, he later explained his observations, saying, "Of course, I'm kidding."
This approach allows Tramp to leave beyond the political speech allowed and to take his words back if necessary.
"I think that it is his way of testing some communications that have been responded among his fans to watch how they act and then "explain" them in some way, depending on the response," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert conducting an analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's cautious about his speeches and he knows that they're flooded enough to treat them differently.
Instead of mitigating the expressions for the broad selection, Tramp took even more freakful tone in the last days, while its rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Tramp was departing from Clinton with a large turnover in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that there was a level in Florida.
Although Tramp is usually trying to not apologize for the provocations he said, he often accuses his criticism of the wrong interpretation of his words and the lack of understanding of his senses of humor.
But since Tramp had become an object of increased attention in the last months of the presidential campaign, his jokes had put his faithful allies in an uncomfortable situation: they must publicly support him, whatever provocational statements he had.
Rudolf W. Juliani, former mayor of New York, who is one of the most famous Deputy Tramp, made serious efforts to protect the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," said Juliani when he was asked about Tramp's credibility that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true that before Obama, IGIL was almost unknown a small organization, he called it an unrepresentable threat, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened, because he brought the troops out of Iraq.
Most of the medium-statist republicans assured that the administration of Obama, in which Clinton took the post of the State Secretary, allowed IGIL to develop, since she had not been able to resolve the situation in the Middle East.
Before the meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Tramp continued to attack the media in Twitter for promoting each of its words and prejudice to it.
He was kidding "poor" television experts trying to figure it out, and said, "They are weak!"
Some democrats laughed at Tramp's excuses as a lack of confirmation that he was not the president.
One day a screwed coffee is returning to Greenpoint.
The Verb cafe was sharpened, only taking cash in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but was a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was expelled from her bedford avenue room.
The Soup Sherry Store, which took the Verb place in summer 2014, is selling sauce in the form of cookies.
The local inhabitants mourned her as the last loss in the new city.
Molly Crabapple's artist wrote on Twitter, "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I can't believe that CBGB's dead, Chelsea's hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a sauce store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, updated.
The restored café Verb opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
In the new Verba, there are Wi-Fi and credit cards, but there are some of the same staff and the same simple atmosphere.
Besides, coffee is still good.
The head of the new Verba is Sisco Rodriguez, an old café employee, who is the owner and general manager in the new place.
He started working at Verba in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to provide him in a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, has left a lot in the old.
Verb's working with the same Baggle distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even set mirrors from the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he would also want to experiment.
He offered new meals.
The menu contains bacon sandwiches, eggs and cheese, and there are toppingues from coppers or roasted bowls.
There's a boiling rice dishes.
There's no beer in the coffee room, but fresh juices are now cooked.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he drew attention to the continuous flow of old permanent clients.
"A number of former clients were also issued by Williamsberg prices," he said.
In one of the recent resurrections, Rebecca Oliviera was one of these clients.
Oliviera, 34 years old, lived in Williamsberg and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that coffee and the atmosphere impressed me in Verba," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although she ordered a bathed tea, another new.
Tom Rosental, another ancient client, was loyally visiting Verb from 2003.
He came before his work and ordered the same thing.
"After 15 minutes of the eighth, every day, as in the hour, I came and made my oil and all ways for me," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and put new meals in the menu.
Today, Rosental is still making an ordinary order, but once, he will change something with bacon, eggs or cheese on the beggle with all the ways.
Rodriguez said he wasn't insulted that the sauce store had once been captured by an old place.
Furthermore, the owners of Soup Sherry proposed to make special soap for Verba, using a cold coffee, as a ingredient.
"I think we may agree on their proposal," said Rodriguez.
Permanent inhabitants of Greenpoint of Poland also loved this coffee.
One of these new clients translated the menu to the Polish, and Rodriguez said he planned to find a place for him in the vitrine so that his new neighbors would feel desired.
There are other benefits from the new place.
The local juice selling point plans to pour the bottles and sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a probability that the coffee will join a neighbouring building.
Many clients have enough to include the new Verb in their favorite meals in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent client and told him he was killed by grief when they closed up.
When the coffee opened in a new place, Whit said that when he came in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he came home.
"How long I wanted to feel this smell," he admitted.
Depressive Depression Food in "Pleasure Food"
In March 1933, shortly after the president's office, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat to lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gurmant, President Roosevelt loved fashion meals of the Fifth Avenue, such as fua gra and Meriland's Turtle Soup.
His menu was more modest on that day: potato sauce eggs, potato sour, and dessert pudding from black grapes.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," Jane Zigelman said.
Her husband Andrew Kou added, "This was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
Men living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in the history of food.
The last book of Coua, "Ragu in Chinese", was dedicated to the Chinese kitchen in America, and Zigelman told the life story in a surveillance apartment in the Lower East Side through food in his book "Home 97 on the street of the Fruct Garden".
Their new joint work, "Pleasure Food", which will be published on Tuesday by Harper's publication, is the history of American food to the Great Depression.
In some degrees of their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple meal in the Fletairon Square, which has been working since 1929, the year of the Bureau.
Zigelman, 54, ordered a liquid cheese and olive sandwich, and Kou, 57, took a turkey, potato fever and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple considered it a suitable point for discussion of food in the Depression ' s age.
"The roulets used a great demand," said Zigelman.
There was a nut roulet, liver roulet, a bean roulet.
They were made of basic ingredients and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to grow.
Imagine you ate as much nuts as you need for dinner.
Kou's screwed up.
"He must have lied in his stone," he said.
During years before Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was the Swedish table.
Women's teams cooked for farm men, and fresh cake was supplied for breakfast, dinner and dinner.
The Americans were sending food to the hungry Europeans during the First World War. The “Pleasure Food” describes how the country managed to suddenly stop being a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for the Americans," Kou said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Similarly, the new budgeting was difficult: mysterious meals, such as roulets and bakers, became the main food products; the baker was a "such a way to utilize meals," said Zigelman, because the cooking could hide unappetitous ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dry fruits.
The meat, the former American food for many years, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutrients have become more important than taste and even cooking sense.
In the study of the book, which includes recipes, Zigelman prepared the meal of that era: a baked bowl of nut oil.
"This supplement to the lunch table has not been successful," said Cou.
Zigelman added, "It was very weird."
The peanut oil does not fit at all with the liver bow.
This was characteristic for many household recipes.
As never before and never since then, housekeeping professionals, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal House Bureau, have managed food habits from 1923 to 1943.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget composers", to accept the call and to convert a burde like a broken spaghetti with carrot into delicious meals.
The "fabric meal" is the featuring of curious historical facts.
Particular stories of the Government ' s response to hungry citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Guvern, in the spirit of “letting to eat pies”.
In his childhood, he was publicly accompanied by the simple agricultural stretch of the state of Iowa, and he was feeding as a delighted millionaire to whom he became.
"He liked continental cuisine, for example, a fish with a barley sauce," Kou said.
He ate practically in a golden dining room, wearing smoking.
He was fantasticly distracted from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with her own stomach.
As explained in the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economist who was not interested in the taste, and this led to the fact that the White House "used not only the most distressed food in Washington but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared."
Many of the culinary recruits of the Depression Age were forgotten once the country regained.
Their inheritance is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Zigelman, and how science was used to prepare food.
Marriages say that during the writing of the book they had better understood the food habits of Zigelman’s mother — that she could not throw out food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of the negligible relationship with food," said Cou.
Zigelman remembers, "She's poisoned people seriously."
There was one unpleasant case with profitors.
When Eisenberg's discharge was released, Cow and I had a dessert that they had prepared at home: a black grape dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called Muss of Cherry," said Zigelman, adding that it was a widespread reception - to give modest recipes the browsing names.
There were no slippers, but black slide, little mushroom, sugar, water, and brown.
Everyone unwillingly loaded the spoon into a tight, brown, sticky substance.
Unfortunately, it was good.
Who two times asked for supplements.
In the voice of a confident budgeter, he said to his wife, "A little cut-off Greek nuts would be good."
Arrest of mass fighting figures on the Howan Trust extended to 14 November
By 14 November, the Pressanian Court left the case of mass fighting at the Howan Trust, satisfying the request for investigation.
14 persons are in the case of accused.
Recall that on 14 May, there was a massive fight in the Howan Trust for several hundred people from Central Asia and Northern Caucas with the use of weapons that killed three people.
Former head of the cemetery, Yuria Chabuev and the lawyer, the public body of the Health Organization, Alexander Bocharnikov, was accused of murder.
The second question of 2016 indexing of pensions can be resolved for the next two or three weeks.
The Vice-Chairman of the Government of RF Olga Hungarac reported this on 12 August during the visit to the Brian area.
We have specific parameters for how much retirement should be made to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
The economists are now doing half-year outcomes, and we will finish this work for the next two or three weeks," quoted the Interfax Hunger.
In comment on the proposed head of the Centre for Strategic Development, Alexei Kudrina, a pension scheme for six months each year, Vice-Premier reported that the cabin was not considered.
At the end of July, the Government had agreed on the full indexing of pension payments in 2017.
The Stone and Gregorian went to the final of a small-caliber-gun shooting competition.
Russian sportsmen, Sergei Kamenski and Cyril Gregorian, took the final of a small-caliber shotgun competition from the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Camenski had made 629 points and took the first place -- a new Olympic qualification record.
Cyril Gregorian became the second -- 628.9 bulls.
There were eight best athletes in the final.
The Stone is a world recorder in this discipline (633).
The Turkish oppositionist Fethullah Guleen requires an international investigation of the circumstances of attempting a State revolution in Turkey.
"I demand that the independent international commission investigate the attempt of a State revolution," the French newspaper Le Monde quoted Gulena.
The Turkish opponent also stated that "if any of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Guleen denies all the involvement in the revolution, emphasizing that his organization had never claimed political authority.
The Court of Istanbul had previously arrested the opposition of the Islamic preacher of Fethullah Gulen.
Recall that the attempt of a military revolution occurred in Turkey at night from 15 to 16 July.
Gilead will reimburse the costs of legal services during the dispute on hepatitis C with Merck
The Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to reimburse the costs of legal services that it has carried on the hepatitis Patent Patent with Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge decided.
In June, the company Gilead was released from the payment of $200 million of damage for the violation of the two patents of Merck related to the medicines of the company Gilead, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the US judge discovered a number of violations by Merck, including the lie under oath and other non-ethical actions.
At trial on Thursday, the federal court judge Beth Labson Freeman said that the Gilead company had the right to reimburse the costs of the judicial dispute.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the new generation of medicines from hepatitis C, which can heal more than 90 per cent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013 when Gilead and Merck courted each other, claiming their lab rights to work based on the sophosbury, an active component of the medicines of the company Gilead.
The armed forces established with United States support claim that they have taken full control of Manbridge from the Islamic State
The armed forces established with United States support have taken full control of the northern city of Manbage near the Turkish border, after the last remaining in the city of the Islamic State had gone, the representative of the group reported on Friday.
Syrian democratic forces (SDS) are now running the cleaning of the city after the rest of the group of warriors hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages retained by warriors, informed the agency Reuters Sharfan Darvich of the Alliance of the CSD of the Manbage Military Council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are taking cleaning operations," he informed the Reuters Agency.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton announced its tax declarations for 2015 on Friday, which showed that the candidate from the Democratic Party and her husband had $10.75 million income in this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clinton received $1 million as a charitable contribution, mainly in the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton, approximately $5.3 million as a privilege, and the former State Secretary claimed a $3 million income from the issuer Simon & Schuster for her book on its stay at the State Department.
The potential Vice-President Clinton, United States Senator Tim Kane from Virginia, together with his wife, Anna Holton, published tax declarations for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to establish a standard of financial transparency," said the adviser of the Clinton Jennifer Palmieri pre-electoral headquarters.
In contrast to it, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and violates his past promises to publish its tax declarations.
It is a common case for candidates to Presidents of the United States to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require that.
The New York Businessman Tramp and his lawyers called the verification of the State Tax Service as a reason why he refused to publish his tax declarations.
"You are on your move," said the Twitter advisor of the Clinton Jan Sams pre-electoral headquarters, taking into account the declarations of a candidate from the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Tramp Adviser Michael Cohen said CNN that Tramp would not allow them to be released until the verifications were completed.
Tramp's criticism, including the candidate for the Presidents of the Republican Party in 2012, Mitta Romney and other republican constituents, said that his rejection raised questions about his condition, its charity contributions, its business operations and other links, including Russia.
Clinton caught up on this issue and released an online video on Friday, where it was primarily devoted to excellent republicans who persuaded Tramp to report tax accounts.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during the talk on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what each candidate has done for decades, without exception to the presidents: to publish his tax declarations," she said to the gathered.
The Politico newspaper reported that Tramp did not pay any taxes or almost no taxes for the two years of 1990s, and a business reviewer of the New York Times quoted many tax lawyers and accountants who believe that it might still exist.
Federal tax rates were subject to a dispute at presidential elections.
Clinton supported the rule named by a billionaire, investor Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people who receive more than one million dollars a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate was based there, proposed that Tramp meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said he was also under the IRS verification, and that Tramp is "strained" not the tax collection agency, but the voters.
Clinton's pre-electoral headquarters published tax declarations until 2007.
Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid the average federal tax rate of approximately 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective total tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was a source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-value pae index fund, and the Clintons claimed dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Condoms with chile powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
The struggle for the protection of the environment in Tanzania uses a non-traditional way to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements — the condoms filled with powder of chile.
The method was effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation organization, which came to mind the idea several years ago, along with the American Nature Protection Committee, had taken its progress by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, which consisted of four steps, a way to protect their homes and seeds without prejudice to animals.
Many used spears before to protect themselves.
The World Day of elephants will be dedicated to animal protection on Friday.
"When we have invented a set of tools ... we have seen a change in relations within these communities, which makes them so much more confident that they can not let elephants into their fields without injury to elephants," said the executive Director Honeyguide Damian Bell in the statement.
The first two steps are in the burning of the torch before the border of the elephant and the signals by the horns.
If he hasn't been scared, they're thrown away the so-called "cloud of chili".
The chile powder, mixed with soil, is placed in a condom, and the end of it turns out, there is only a fitile outside.
When condoms are inflammated, it is screwed with a grape, spraying a small dust of chile in the air.
One duning is usually enough to turn the elephant to the other side.
The ultimate measure is a lighting device that shoots Roman candles into the air by making a loud, bright explosion.
32 Turkish diplomats have not yet returned to Turkey, who have left the country after the attempt to revolve in July this year.
Such data were brought by the head of MID of Turkey, Mevlut Chavushoglu, in a conversation with local journalists.
At the first stage, we revoked 208 staff diplomats to continue their work in the centre.
32 of them have not returned without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish External Political Office.
Recall that an attempt to reverse the State was made in Turkey in July.
The authorities of the countries have officially stated that the disruption has failed, as well as reported that more than six thousand persons were detained, including military acts of higher and medium.
As a result of an attempt to reverse, 290 people were killed, according to the MID of Turkey.
The Jewish director drastically discriminated the Berlin Hotel for the removal of Israel's telephone code on the “please” of the Arabs, reports the RT News Channel
The French director of Jewish origin untied the scandal in the media, finding that the hotel of Kempinski Bristol in Berlin does not appear in the list of Israeli telephone code, referring to “pleases” by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of a documentary film on Holocaust Shoa, expressed his displeasure in the hotel of Campinski Bristol in Berlin, wrote an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay in the Lanceman hotel, Israel was tried to find in the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
However, the country has not been mentioned among States where to call directly from the room.
How could Israel be excluded and eliminated in Berlin in 2016, the capital of New Germany?
Written by Lanceman.
In exchange, Kempinski Bristol provides the opportunity to gather Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of explanation, the director raised this issue at the hotel administration stand.
The answer he got there, according to Lanceman, "Shocked him."
Clerk said that this action was a "reasonable solution to the management of the hotels of Kempinski."
The cause behind this step has caused a more anger of the director.
"The majority of our guests of Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's code be removed," said Lansman, a hotel minister.
The Ambassador of Israel in Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "safe shame," reports the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's really awful shame.
What happened in Germany and this hotel network, is even more shameful.
I don't need any explanations here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," the official said.
The case caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the hotel of Kempinski was simply " on the ground" of the alleged requirements of Arab clients.
“We would be ashamed, ” said another post, which indicated that the hotel located on the famous Kurfurstendam Street is next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself has hurried to revoke any charges, named the unsub and "excused" to Lanzman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order to include Israel in the list of fast sets," quoted the representative of the hotel of Kempinski Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code is now added.
Police uses tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met the police in the city of Sao Paul in Brazil on Thursday to protest government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The disagreements began when police officers tried to dissolve students, which resulted in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Pursuant to the suggestions of the Governor of the State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public high schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some participants of the protest could be seen on the walls of graphics against the provisional responsibilities of President Michael Temer.
This last protest occurred only a few days after the protesting mass came out to support the dismissed President Dilma Rusef, when the country's Senate voted for its impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 per cent, reports the RT Business portal
With the abolition of the sanctions between Moscow and Teheran, 70.9 per cent increased compared to the previous year, according to Ambassador of Russia in Iran, Lebanon Jagarjan.
Since international sanctions against Iran were withdrawn, the Russian companies had increased interest in business management in the country, said the Ambassador.
Russian companies renew links with Iran, and new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further increase in trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Jagarian.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the commodity between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
Trade has been achieved through the supply of machine equipment, ground vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
Jagarian also predicts that Russia will visit the recorded number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mainly tourist citizens of Iran.
In addition, Iran entered top-20 countries on the number of tourists visiting Russia for the first time.
It can be confident that last year's record of the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be beaten," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, that the ambassador hopes to change.
"I personally recommend visiting the towns of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yed, in which the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are maintained in good condition," he said.
The State continues to revolve hacks in the defence-industrial complex.
The " systematic non-compliance" of the concrete director Almaz Antey, "release" and "trust of confidence" were caused to dismissal.
The NGO leader for the next three years was appointed Gennadius Benderski.
Intelligence on dismissal was only appeared on Thursday night and did not produce a broad resonance in the media.
How can such silence be explained in terms of large army rearmament?
The RF leadership probably does not wish to disseminate any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This reaffirms that the defence-industrial complex (OPC) has many problems, and the State does not wish to draw attention to them by society.
The dismissal of Nescreen was, of course, an important event from the perspective of order in the sector.
The Almaz NGO is the main concrete enterprise specialized in the production of marine and ground-based marine rockets (GRC).
Almaz is currently working on the creation of Polyment-Redit and Morpheus, which are planned to be placed on new corvets, fregates, esmines and cruisers.
The founder of the Portal Military Russia Dmitrij Cornev believes that the release of the Nescream was due to a break in the deadlines under the projects.
This version is most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and the introduction was expected in 2013.
"Redit Polyment" should be the main system for the new BMF ships.
The information I receive has not been performed in a few years of testing.
Truth is, as far as I can judge, there is no unanimous guilt for Almaza," Cornev said.
The expert fears that the delay in the operation may also occur with the P-500 RRK.
Experience-constructive work on the project has not yet been completed, but the first complexes should become troops during 2016.
The Ministry of Defense assured that “work is being done planned and all will be completed within the deadlines established”, although in 2014 the Department recognized the problem with the development of P-500.
It is extremely difficult to evaluate the professional qualities of AImas since 2011.
Cornev concluded that the termination of projects could be both cause and cause of dismissal.
In his view, in recent years, it has been extremely difficult to gather information on internal processes in the OCC and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for dozens of billions of rubles, and large money is known to love silence.
The Defence Companies Directors are generally departing from their own positions, on the agreement of the parties, or transferred to other work.
In this case, the withdrawal has been publicly, although it has not been reconciled.
This implies the idea that Almaza's manager may have been a strict figure and resisted the "shooted" top.
Apparently, the State is no longer intention of peace with such behavior.
The shareholders will remove those who prefer to argue with the installations of the Mino-Defense and do not fulfil the tasks set out.
At the same time, the RF leaders seek to punish producing managers (mainages at the Star Courts).
Increased attention to the sector's issues has been given by the President.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kreml protects the numbers of OCC managers, endeavouring to have a loyal composition of directors to carry out the orders received above.
This is far inadequate policy, but there is no State ' s lack of normal competition in the OCC.
The situation in defence, of course, is not a catastrophic situation but the current geopolitical environment stimulates Kremlin as soon as possible.
In parallel with the " cleaning" of managers in the OPC, RF leadership has taken successful steps to improve Russian troops ' professionalism.
The staff membership of the army acquired a new quality as Minister for Defence of Sergei Shoigu.
It is impressive that the president took a known saying: "You want peace to prepare for war."
During the cold war, the military force of the SSSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s had led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Covenant, which had strengthened the scope of influence on the continent behind Moscow.
With all the deficiencies of the bipolar system, it worked effectively.
The proof was that there were no wars in the European continent and a relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The winners ' marketing in the cold war has resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrors in Europe and the United States in a civilized world, there may be no peaceful corner left.
Despite the common trouble, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the equal partner level.
In such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain to the fleet and the army.
Strengthening the military power will enable Moscow to stand more effectively in national interests and to enter into new abroads of world policies.
Scotch Callum Skinner is running on the final line, and the British are taking bike gold.
The Scotch Callum Skinner was rushing to triumph in a man's command sprint at the Rio velodrome last night, which resulted in the command trio of Great Britain protected its title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glazgo crop was the strongest one his friend, Sir Chris Hoy, who made his own own, and the young man was proud to come into history, running through the final line to get out of the victory of the Favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain stated the right to a sudden victory four years ago, winning when Hoy stated the right to the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after they finished with slightly six in the March World Championship in the Track Velogans in London, despite Hoy's career since.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff's specialist.
They did the same thing when Hindes came up.
The departure of Hoya has also created the void that Kyan Emadhi and Matt Crempton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches, seeing the potential in the Scotch, which was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny, the Hoy champions four years ago, and Skinner established the Olympic qualification record, but the rule was overcome by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindez was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change in the strategy was a major part of the transformation where Hindes had been on a larger transmission to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, to keep Skinner pace.
Hoy observed from his seat as an invitated BBC expert and caught the view of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgo said, "This is a forest comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can and make my name.
We set up the Olympic record in the final and defeated the world's champions.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes intentionally acknowledged his fall on the track after the failure launch.
He renounced the commentary later, and there was no way to appeal by the British competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like London, with all those British flags on the tribune."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost so many races with the world's name that winning the Olympics was just amazing again.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven of the 10 names of the race both in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress, perfect in the past five months, the velodrom is waiting for five more successful days.
With the form demonstrated by Kenny, it is not beyond the possibility to imagine how he repeated the Hoya move by winning three Olympic gold medals in one Game.
This would see Kenny, who was just 12 years younger, Hoya, who was also born on 23 March (this seems to be the holy date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister)) as an account of six gold medals and one silver.
It would be just like Hoy.
The next time, Kenny competes in a sprent that begins today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old outlaw from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Command competitions are always the best.
You're coming to win with your companions.
It's a little lonely to win alone, honestly.
Hindez said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must get a knight."
It was the only fun of the medals in the day, but there was next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doll are qualified by the fastest four-mile team race.
They finished at 3:51.943.
The world record set at the winning of gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 a.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event where Wiggins will be in the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the Commissioners yesterday, before the qualification visit, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In the appropriate female event, which renews and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rousselle Shand, Eleanor Barker and Kathy Archibald of Milgawi showed a world record, showing time 4:13.260.
The command of Great Britain came to the fact that it was relying on a powerful bike team to take Olympic Olympic Games in the medium period and earn a bunch of medals.
After indeed exclusive demonstrations of full superiority in Beijing and London, the expectations were weakened in gradual training for Rio.
There were dramas on the second, not the last, leaving the office of the Technical Director Shane Sutton in April for the accusations of sexism and anxiety, and the care of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first evening race on the velodrome, the legendary glory of Great Britain now seemed to reach the tops at the right time, perhaps just again.
The future Portland metallurgical factory is threatened by breaking the electricity contract
The future portland aluminium factory in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workers, is threatened because the electricity company that supplies the factory, according to one of the owners of the factory, is going to break the supply contract: all supplies are planned to be broken down.
This step is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend the subsidies provided to support the operation of the factory.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be threatened at the Alcoa factory in Portland.
All 2,000 jobs — directly and indirect — may be in a risk area as a result of any closing.
Additional indirect consequences can also be, as the metallurgical factory consumes about 10 per cent of all the electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgical factory in Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power station in Angles last year.
The Portland metallurgical factory of Alcoa loses money and risks closing.
These actions have been the outcome of the future of the factory, which has lasted for several years, as a result of the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later due to the price of the factory.
The AGL company, which supplies a large aluminium plant with its Low Yang A electricity in Latrob Valley, said that the other three owners would also take steps to break the treaty.
The controlling share of the factory belongs to the joint short-term company of Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp belong to smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland object to continue to work, i.e. that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical factory will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are the so-called 'hedged contracts ' which were to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month breakdown period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"The AGL is still expecting those contracts to bring their portion of revenue in 2017 for the financial year," said the Electric Energy Company.
Any potential impact on the profits of AGL from the 2018 financial year has been limited to the strong fucher market for electricity prices.
The AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accountability by $187 million in terms of " the forthcoming breakdown " .
According to Alcoa, the decision to break the contracts "does not affect the ability of Alcoa to manage the metallurgical factory or to provide electricity to the metallurgical factory".
The American company stated that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which had to be entered into force in November this year, but still had to explain why it had broken the contract.
The analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical factory in Victoria and the Tomago factory next to Newcastle because of the disadvantaged economic situation in the industry.
Turning to the analysts earlier this week, the head of the AGL Office of Exploitation, Steven Mickelsen, said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually, and Tomago is about 900 megawatts.
If both of these factories leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electroenergy].
It will be bad for us as a producer," he said.
Not only a reality show show of Cardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, model and fourth daughter of the Cardashian Genner Mother Manager Chris, appeared on the desired September cover of the American magazine Voguee.
Kendall, who was the face of Estee Lauder's Brand and defiled fashion on Sundays in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in her account in Instagram on Thursday.
"When I was in the room with my favorite people, I looked at this cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The news on the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the Cardashian Family?), a prepared reality video, in which the whole family of Cardashian Jenner (deboshire Rob and Caitlin, also joined the universal most favorite Uncle of the Cardashian family), forgot the appearance of the sister on the cover, and at the end of the classical turn: they planned a surprise party.
This is the standard story line of almost all episodes of child television shows dedicated to the birthdays (Sikrest says, "Did you think we've forgotten about you?" with the honestness of the rabbit from the 8th morning program), but Chris needed this glory to get to other girls.
Because with this episode devoted to September's Vogue number, we certainly entered the new era of the Cardashian show.
May the senior sister Kendall Kim get on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanie West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is a achievement by itself.
The September issue is the most selling issue of Vogue annually.
A thick, more like a gift issue than a fashion magazine, attracts a large number of advertisingers (on the account of the Fashionist portal, 615 pages of last year's 832 page issue were advertising).
The news of who from the stars will fall on his cover is so eager that in the last two years the photographs of the magazine have been combined until the official announcement.
The number of previous women on the cover includes Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, more "markets that work in models" than "models that are famous" have been presented on the cover.
The Oscar Prize Laureate and the face of the Brand Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, a year after the honor was dropped by Lady Gaga.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, which the magazine described as a "excellent model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These famous ones are not relatives of famous people, reality stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
They're really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonce, who appeared on the last year's cover, this year, he was one of the most lucky in his career in connection with the release of Lemonade album.
Of course, they're not all happy for the success of Jenner.
The situation of Jenner in the world of fashion, due to her past star of television reality show, always had to be screwed up.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Jiji Hadid, called them "the bitches of the moment".
Those moods were rebuilt after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it doesn't make sense.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September Vogue number.
She's a supermodel in all the senses of that word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you a tone cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, are selling you their photos in their same apps available on payment.
She sells photos of the daughter of Cindy Crawford magazine Love.
And in the free time, perhaps still to see her sister Courtney and her children, she's participating in a reality show on TV.
Public legal centres deny the service of 160,000 per year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the least protected representatives refuse to serve in public legal centres, since the sector is preparing for the effect that will further cut the funding for and so already being held in the field of activities.
In Queensland, three of the five people — mostly, older, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who have no ability to fight unfair deprivation of property and so on — have already been rejected by trying to obtain free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services, already working outside the possibility, are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres should lose 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the Queensland Public Legal Centres James Farrell said that, according to the report of the latest census of the National Association of Public Law Centres, thousands of people have been rejected annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision was not cancelled, the situation would only deteriorate.
“Quinsland's public legal centres are constantly receiving insufficient funding: that means that thousands of people are rejected in their vital services,” he said.
People who are out of violent relations, people with unauthorized and disobedient debts, families passing through divorce, unfairly dismissed workers -- all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, thus thousands of less protected citizens of Queensland will be forced to address complex legal issues without assistance.
We call upon the Minister of Justice and Senator Queensland George Brandis to immediately cancel those reductions in funding so that people can receive the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
Last year, the Government of the State had fulfilled its obligation to increase the financing of free legal assistance to the country ' s average rate.
It is now time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and the Government of Palastuk is time to invest in this important work.
Donald Tramp's pre-electoral headquarters were tried after a staff member was allegedly threatened by a gun
According to New York, Donald Tramp's pre-electoral headquarters were brought to court: the headquarters were alleged to do nothing after the report that his operating director in North Carolina threatened a gun to a staff member when they drove in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in the judicial proceedings issued on Wednesday in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, former programme instructor in the State's pre-electoral headquarters.
Bordini said he was waiting for a few months to solve the problem internally, but he realized that "this will not happen".
The director Earl Phillip "watched the gun, put his right pointing finger on the trigger and put a dull on the knee cup of Vincent," says Bordini in complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional pre-electoral headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four other people became participants of similar incidents with Philip, the treatment was claimed.
"The guns don't have to shoot to harm them," Bordini said in complaint.
The case took place only two days after the presidential candidate from the Republican party made a furor, saying to the listeners in North Carolina that “the people of the Second Amendment”, which are understood as arms owners and his lovers, could begin to act if his competitor, Hillary Clinton, was elected and able to choose judges.
Tramp's pre-electoral headquarters said that the media had pulled his words out of the context and that it had not been expressed in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini requires compensation from the pre-electoral headquarters for non-controlled control, and for the threat of physical violence, injury and moral harm.
The representative of Tramp Hope Hicks is slow to respond to the request to comment.
The attempts to talk to Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip had recently left the electoral headquarters.
In response to his consulting firm, the Innovation Consulting Services, no one called quickly.
The President of the Republican Party, Donald Tramp, has held a dispute campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Court General, Department of the Supreme Court of McLeneburg, Charlotte.
Britain must send the Olympic spirit to the right move and extend the Hytrou
Intelligentness will also bring rehabilitation and prosperity not only in our populations here and throughout London, but also throughout the country.
I think this was exactly the huge advantage of Heathrow, exactly as it was with London 2012, where we made all our efforts to make our peoples and regions benefit from Games.
The Olympic Games have made great benefits for Stratford and East End.
And we'll do that again by creating opportunities for local inhabitants and firms near Heathrow.
Only for our populations here we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, those who believed that the Eitrou ' s expansion would be too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic games and that we would be in a difficult situation in the world's arena.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they would prove wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about it.
Like the Olympic Games of Heathrow, it is a infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving inheritance of skills and employment both around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent team in Hytrou, which introduced a programme of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in timely and within the budget, from T5 elected by the best terminal of the airport for five years, up to T2, built in the middle of two most busy airlines in the world.
They are now ready to provide a third landing bar confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The Olympic Games in London 2012 were a huge success for Britain, and I am sure that the extension of Heathrow will also be.
It is time for us to direct the Olympic Spirit to the right way and expand the Hytrou, providing our commercial future and creating the inheritance of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton, Chairman of the Council of Heathrow and former Trade Attache of Crime
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays "Cats-Mix" on the issue of advertising blocking
For companies who earn money on the Internet advertisement, attempts to cross the programming of the advertising are a game of cats, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, literally a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertising blockers on its desktop version, Adblock Plus published a blog that users could update their filters in the program to block the advertising in the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the web site's desktop version has changed the line around its advertising to make the advertising blockers more difficult to identify which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims he was able to cross the new code.
In his blog, representative Adblock Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual combating between the community of advertising blockers with an open source code and those who are trying to surround it continued since the invention of a advertising blocking” and perhaps Facebook would present its own decision soon.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has entered into combating is a clear sign of the major problem of the advertising blockers for the industry.
In the world, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to the last year's Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
Given 1.3 billion daily active users who go to Facebook through mobile devices, the mobile ads are now 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising income.
However, the company is hunting for advertising blockers on the table, as the representative said that mobile advertising blockers are ineffective in Facebook's mobile applications for social networks and Instagram.
However, the advertising in the table version is a sufficient income article to consider Facebook a profitable investment.
Furthermore, on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its advertising instrument to provide more control over how the advertising is tagged.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters cause anxiety, as they would also block some unreclamated content on the website.
"It will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," said the representative of Facebook in the official e-mail.
The advertising blockers are a rough tool, and instead, we focused on creating instruments such as the Advertising Preferences to transfer management to human hands.
The woman was moved to the Swiss highway in an apparent suicide episode
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police called upon witnesses after a woman moved several vehicles on the highway early on Thursday morning in a clear attempt to suicide.
The incident took place at A1 near Morge in the canton in a midnight Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the darkness of desperation gesture and was hit by several vehicles, the police reported.
Apparently, in attempting to kill herself, a Swiss woman at 49 years of age hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several involved drivers have already been questioned, but some have not yet been identified, the police who calls on them and anyone else witnessing the incident to respond.
A criminal case, a " logical" step in this situation, said the lawyer to Žile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is still necessary to find out whether any of the involved drivers would be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a strike?
This is what the prosecutor must define," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be considered responsible.
In each case, both of whom are involved in the darkness of the road was sentenced that carists could not expect a random meeting on the road in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was justified of cautioning death after she hit and killed the A1 man near Pierne at night in August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, listened to the court.
The court found that a policeman, who responded to an emergency call, had managed a vehicle that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was “perfectly exclusive and unforeseen”, the judge said.
Anyone who has information on the event on Thursday near Morge should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have been inhabited once, according to the NASA new climate model.
Scientists from the Institute of Outer Space Study of Goddard developed a model for the past Vienna study, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climateists.
The model was designed to determine whether in Venera, with its hot waterless surface and the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, ever existed conditions similar to the earth.
Scientists previously assumed that a small rotation speed of Venera was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modeling suggests that Venus could probably have a cut atmosphere like that of the earth, and still turn slowly.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variables to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Vienna also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent tighter.
"According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venera sets its daily side to the sun for almost two months at a time," explained the scientist from GISS, Anthony Del Henio.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces a rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that act as a zontic that protects the surface of the planet from a substantial part of the sun’s heat.
The result is the average climate temperatures, which, unfortunately, are a few degrees colder than today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to development, which previously had been expected by planet study professionals.
Despite the possibility that Venus was once inhabited, she had been affected by too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans went out and her water pair was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen floated, only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- that is, Venus, which we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Climate Model of Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves the Avalanche team coach
Patrick Roy left the post of Coach and Vice-President of the Colorado Avalanche hockey activities on Thursday, refering to the lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
The executive vice-president/the chief head of the Colorado team, Joe Sakik, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties of the Chief Coach and Vice-President of Colorado Avalanche's hockey activities with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in the statement.
During the summer, I have been thinking long and carefully about how I could improve this team to give it the depth she needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve that goal, the vision of the coach and Vice-President of hockey activities must be perfectly consistent with the organization's vision.
It should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions are not met at present.
Sakik, who hired Roya on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrik told me about his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy became Jack Adams Award's best coach of the League during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and wins in the Central Division, but Colorado was scattered by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points left the Wild team in the fight for the second easy trip to participate in the Western Conference.
The gateway from the Hall of Slava, Roy won four Stanley Cup — two of Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oils renew negotiations and stop strike
The oil salary strikes in the North Sea are suspended, and all parties to the discussion are approaching a new round of negotiations, reported by the leading representatives of the parties.
Strikes against oil-servicing Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea in Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unions of Unite and RMT can confirm that we agreed to renew the negotiations process to resolve current disputes," said the joint statement.
We will spend several full-day meetings for the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of the next week to look at the problems with a fresh view.
The trade unions reported that their recent action, which, as they said, was the first in more than 25 years, had been addressed against potential reductions in salary to up to 30 per cent.
The Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contractors working in the North Sea this year by approximately 9 per cent due to the negative market tension.
The reduction of the company's rates has occurred after 10 per cent reduction in contractual staff working on the beach in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions would give it a space necessary to overcome market decline.
Shell, for its part, reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil activities in countries up to 10, as it rationalized its activities as a result of its mega-lining with the British Energy Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to degraded prices for uncleaned oil: the economic situation has deteriorated because of the decision to leave the European Union adopted in June by the Great Britain.
The Scottish member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour conflicts in the Northern Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and across the country, we need a economy that would work for most people, not only for some," he said.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea in 2016, contrast with an average of approximately $7 billion for the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the Pleyad Square
The latest space telescope mission, Kepler, helped astronomers gather the fullest catalog of star rotation in the Pleyad Building.
New data help astronomers understand why the stars in the scope are rotating with different speeds and how the rotation periods are compared to the formation of planets.
"We hope that, comparing our results with other star bunches, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," Louisa Ribal, a scientific officer of the Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Technology Institute, said.
The Plejed is in 445 light years from the Earth.
Many stars in the bunch are only attaining maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're turning as fast as they never will.
At their peak speed of rotation, these growing stars throw out a large amount of star wind.
By traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a braking effect on stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star, tracking the time between the occurrence of known star spots, such as sunflowers.
The latest rotation speed catalog suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Fishal compares stars to dancers: larger piruets are slower than smaller.
"In the ballet, we see that those who rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those who rotate faster, usually refer to very light stars," said Ribal.
Since the Pleyed scope is so close, it serves a perfect space lab to compare star properties with rotation speeds.
"The Star Building of the Pleyada provides a point for theoretical star rotation models both younger and older," said Ribal.
We still want to know how, where and why the stars slow down their rotation speed and hang on their "tance shoes", in a way.
Fishal and her colleagues detailed their last analysis of the turning speed of the Pleyed in three new articles, which will soon be published in the astronomical magazine.
The investigation related to the activities of the Ukrainian diversant group in Crime is conducted by two offices, says Commersante.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in preparing diverssions in Crime.
As previously reported, the inhabitant of the Ukrainian city of Energy, Eugene Panov, agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
He said that he considered the Titan Hymbudge in Armenia, the oilbase in Feodosia, the Kerchen shipping, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airports.
Legislatives believe that the detention was far from all diversant participants.
This was, inter alia, the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Simferopol Paradise of Kiev, notes the publication.
Stannislav Churches was the principal coach of the Russian soccer collection
At the meeting of the Russian Football Union, a decision was taken to appoint the Chief Russian Coach for Football, Stanislav Churchesov.
The contract will be calculated for two years before the MM-2018 completion.
On 11 August, the PFS appointed the Chief Russian Football Coach, Stanislav Churches.
It is a famous footballist who used to play in Moscow Spartacus as a gateway, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was a teacher of Russian teams such as Spartacus, "Greek-Socci", "Terek", "Amcar", "Dinamo", as well as the Warsaw Legia, who was the winner of the national prime and the cup of the country.
It is reported that the Churches contract will be signed in the nearest time and calculated for two years.
Thus, he is responsible for preparing the World Championship of 2018.
It is known that his training headquarters will be included in Miroslav Romastenko, Guntaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There are information that the total training headquarters pays 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the RFS leadership set a goal for Stanislav Churches to bring Russia to the semi-final and to conquer medals.
As the coach himself said, he considered the establishment of a competitive environment in the team as a priority and would give footballists the opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Churches, he was glad that his choice had fallen upon him.
The first match led by the Churchesov meeting of Russia will be held on 31 August in Antilla, a communion meeting with the Turkish team.
Recall, earlier, Leonid Sluckie was the head of the Russian football coach, combining him with coaching at the CSCA club.
He announced his departure from the post after the failure of the Russian national team to Euro-2016 in France.
However, he took responsibility for the bad result of the gathering.
At the time of the long fight against the apartheid, Namibia suffered seriously between Angola and South Africa.
Nevertheless, after the independence of South Africa in 1990, the country with 2.4 million people has achieved great success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for the success of Namibia was that the Government focused on education.
While people in developed countries view themselves as a understanding free primary and secondary education, many poor countries in the middle and even primary schools require a fee for training.
Furthermore, Governments are often advised to make training fees for " cost reimbursement".
However, in Namibia, primary schools are free.
Furthermore, the average education has been free since 2015.
The authorities of the countries also work actively on other important areas.
Malaria destruction efforts have reduced the number of annual cases of 97 per cent in the past ten years.
In contrast to the international trend of inequality, it is reduced in Namibia.
In comparison with the 1993 indicator, the Ginny coefficient, which was a standard indicator of the inequality of income distribution, declined by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this indicator was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate decreased from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty ( less than $1.90 per day) has also decreased from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest rating of freedom of speech in Africa, according to "Reporters Without Borders " .
The country has significantly preceded the United States and other rich States.
Furthermore, the country has a favourable rating -- one of the highest in Africa -- in the Index of the perception of corruption, comprising human rights defenders from Transparence International.
Even now, when commodity prices fall, Namibia is able to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, debt to GDP is about 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 of the debt in the United States and most of the European countries.
Of course, there are some problems in Namibia.
The unemployment level, at least under traditional evaluation methods, remains sufficiently high - almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS in Namibia is almost 17 per cent of the population infected.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is the number of countries with income above the average, but the authorities insist that their State is actually a developing country.
Namibia is definitely facing some difficulties that will be present to the weakly developed economies.
The State must develop a very large and dry country with small populations.
In the territory of the countries in the desert, isolated nomad tribes of collectors, which should be integrated in modern society, without losing their identity.
Integration of people that had been on the periphery of the world economy four centuries ago is a challenge for any country.
It is even more difficult for Namibia: as any other country in the world, it faces the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think of dropping her hands, but the country solves the challenges facing it.
Almost immediately after the acquisition of independence, the government was engaged in the establishment of a diversified economy and a combined society.
It is noted that competitive political fractions were gathered together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap health care not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbours.
About 15 to 20 per cent of the visitors of medical institutions in the northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia speaks of building a wall that would separate the country from the poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that the neighbours were not choosing and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate to share deficit water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to promote investment and exchange of students.
Furthermore, the Government of Namibia has justified that rich natural resources can easily become curse by promoting the wealth of few people through many.
The authorities understand that income from Namibia's natural wealth needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive powers.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek a maximum profit from the country ' s sale of resources, and to review investment laws and contracts to make sure that it is.
Transparency is crucial for this process, so strong support by the Government of freedom of speech is so important.
As the head of the Hague Gaingob state noted, the media often say what he did not like.
But after the fight against the freedom of apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms received, said the President.
Not all Namibia's key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fisheries, are renewable, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia indicates that even those countries that start with serious deficiencies -- racism, colonial structure, inequality and low development -- can become a path to general prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the Gold of Varna, the most ancient gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 before our era).
It was probably the loudest archaeological sensation in the 1970s: in Bulgaria, at the excavations of the Varnen Necropole, a fantastic number of gold artefacts was found — more than three thousand total weights of six kilograms.
Only one funeral known as "Mogla No. 43" was removed from 990 gold items of a total weight of more than 1,5 kg.
However, the official status of the oldest gold of the world could soon go to an unexpected storm found by the archaeologists in July this year.
Again, in Bulgaria, in a pre-historic settlement known as Tel Junaci.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tel Junaci are far from the sea, near the village of the Yunaci of the Pazarjik region.
The bowl is a golden bar that is turned into a ring.
Javor Boyajiev, director of excavations in Tella Junaca, dated the findings of 4600 years before our era and stated that she was older than Varna's gold for at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, remember, are dated approximately the same period, from 4600 to 4200 years before our era.
There are no technologies that allow the dating of the metal to be perfectly precise.
How, then, can you be confident in what gold is more ancient?
Apparently, Professor Boyajiev knows more than he told the Reuters: "I'm absolutely sure that the gold of the Junaca is older than the gold of Varna."
It's an emergency finding: it's a small object, but it's big enough to take the right place in history.
Reuters Boyajiev reported in the interview that scientists are analyzing the metal composition and re-and more carefully studying the archaeological layer where golden artefact was found.
This will help date the busin with the maximum precision possible.
The place of finding also explains a lot.
The Tel Junaci is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
The Tel Junaci is currently considered the ancient city of Europe.
The Tel was founded by the descendants of people migrating to Europe from Anatolia (now Turkey) in the 7th millennium before our era.
For centuries, metal processing has been rapidly developed in this region, from the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full industry.
The country history of this archaeological community has a special title: the Balkan-Carpath metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium before our era, the metal processing centres began to form a city type settlement.
They are now called the ancient cities of Europe.
The Tel Junaci may be the most ancient, since the artefacts of 4900 before our era were found here.
I would call the Tel Junaci prototype of the modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"It is a place of a thousand years older than Schumer," said Boyajiev, having a general view that the city culture was born in southern Mezopotamia, modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the common understanding of this word.
The Tellah Junaci scope has been carried out since 1976.
During that time, the archaeologists digged nearly 12 acres, which is about a third of the alleged area of the settlement.
The remnants of the fortress wall have been found, reaching three meters high.
The houses and workshops have little stored, but the archaeologists clearly distinguish the streets, public buildings, urban density, the business center and the dwelling areas.
The Tel Junaci are often called "The Bird City," and there were dozens of clay figures of birds found.
All birds are represented in peace, and from here there was the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but the object of local worship.
The Bird City was destroyed about 4100 years before our era, perhaps by indio-European tribes coming from north-east.
The nomads had no cities, but there were horses and weapons.
Three-metre fortress walls did not stop them.
The archaeologists discovered obvious signs of cruel fighting: the remnants of older men, women and children found inside the homes with wounds of the seasons.
New findings and new facts appear annually, changing the common ideas of ancient history of mankind.
The Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly speaking not of individual cultures, but of the " lost" first civilization of Europe in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive in searching for this civilization has been the "Warna's gold" found relatively recently in 1972.
It's logical that the golden luxury of Varna had to be before -- something like a tiny gold bowl created in Tella Junaca.
In Porsche, model 911 Targa has been artificially aged
It is officially stated that the preparation of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is conducted by manual professionals of the serial vehicles.
The retro port is, for example, a special color of Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model -- even a model logo.
Furthermore, the Targa has received a firm white graph alongboards and special 20-inch wheel drives of RS Spyder, as well as some of the decorations of the pieces decorated in "white gold metal".
In the retro-lines, it is noted that it differs, on a large account, by gray blue gamma, with new chairs with expanded ranges of electroregulation and separated black anadosed steel thresholds with the unit logo.
Furthermore, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car scrap and a richly separate album with photographs of the production process.
Porsche Exclusive specialists did not touch the force installation: the retro-targ of characteristics is fully compatible with the series.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbine industries of 3.0 l, developing 420 L.C. and 500 N.E.
The most dynamic version 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released by limited tissue, but neither its amount nor the value of each specific sports car shall be reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers solved the arms race
The recent introduction of Facebook technology preventing advertising on social sites has caused decisionmakers to block advertising to response.
In AdBlock Plus they released the antidote, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus proclaimed its new technology, which would probably remain effective for a short time.
The social representatives noted that, in order to deceive the new " unlocked" technology, AdBlock Plus's decision, along with commercial announcements, blocks many common posts from friends or pages.
On Facebook, they regretted this policy by AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
As the source told among the developers of the TechCrunch publication, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop will be prepared for the next hours.
Thus, social networks and blockers linked a race of weapons, attempting to win each other, but the affected party became users who missed interesting records from friends or who saw the advertisement where they had not used to see each other.
The ethical aspects of advertising have recently caused hot disputes.
In Murmansk, the violent will be presented in court by the Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been completed in the Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation on the Marman Area.
The prosecution of a 54-year-old man is very serious -- the execution of violent sexual acts.
The result was that, at the end of November 2015, the accused in the street of Paul in Murmansk had committed sexual acts with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sanction of the article provides for the maximum penalty of deprivation for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring Fengguang Crossven 370 to Russia and the Rich New - Foundation website www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the popularity of the class of cars in China, combining the dignity of miniven and crossware.
Another announced Russian Prime Minister is Rich New.
Many Western companies, Moscow International Car Salon, decided this year to ignore, so the empty exhibition of the Expo exhibition chambers would fill Chinese companies.
In particular, a powerful front will be the Dongfeng Motor corporation, which has large types in the Russian market and intends to offer some interesting news to our cars in the near future.
One of them will be Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which was sold in China this spring at a price of 55,900 Yuanas (not less than 550,000 bullets per current course).
The Russians are unlikely to be familiar with the question of deliveries to our country as far as it is in the stage of discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 as a result of June's sales was able to reach the 11th place in the list of the most sold minivens, although due to a large road education (175 mm) and the protective plastic coverage on the lower perimeter of its cousin can be fully composed of crosswares.
Crossven is built on the front platform of Fengguang 360, in the 370th is the same wheel base in 2725 mm, but the shops are a little longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is more solid and wealthy.
The salon was decorated by wooden plans, but the picture of a large vertical sensor screen like Tesla on the central console was only on the early exhibition copies of Crossven, and the "music" cars came to sell.
Five of the seven landing sites are easily composed, forming a flat loading area length of 1650 mm, the maximum trunk amount of 1500 l.
The engine for Fengguang 370 provides only one-5-litre gasoline fuel " atmospheric" power of 115 l.s, combined with a 5-step mechanical transmission box.
The manufacturer modestly silents the dynamic qualities of the car, but he promises that the savings budget of the owner is appetite at 6.7 l/100 km.
The Picap Rich New is well-known to the Russians Nissan NP300 Navarra of the past generation, but with slightly compromised Chinese designers.
Despite the morally aged structure, this model is still using a stable demand for the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unwanted “working horse”.
At the same price, Rich New must be interested in Russians, because modern Japanese trucks have become very expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two electoral engines: gas 2.4 l (137 ls) or 2.5 l (116 l).
The transmission box is only mechanical, but there are modifications with a strictly connected front.
The Dongfeng stand and the new flagman sedan A9, his Russian prime ministerial representation of the Chinese company was announced in June.
Minveno-like crosswords in the Chinese market are increasingly increasing, one of the recent news is Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
The Russian liner Dongfeng is currently composed of two models: S30 sedan and H30 Cross hatchbeck.
During seven months of this year, Chinese business dealers implemented 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax reports will cease to be sent by the www.zr.ru
The tax inspection has changed the order of dispatch of property tax notifications.
All Russian owners have used to the unchanged years of the scheme: they receive an e-mail card for transport tax for the previous year on summer and autumn.
However, many of them will not wait this year.
The fact is that the tax inspection without noise has changed the order of notification of citizens.
Those registered in the Personal Office of the Taxer on the official website of the office.ru will be e-mailed.
Inspections were automatically considered by such Russians as online users and emphasized by the standard, " paper " dispatch.
News will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All others will continue to receive common letters.
However, the possibility of returning to the old scheme is also available by the owners of the accounting record on the website.
In order to do so, they will have to visit the tax office during August and make a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notification will appear in the "private office" immediately after the composition, while the letter will take a few days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet tax inspection has over 18 million people, which will allow the Department to save seriously on the mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens of a change in order.
Some could have registered themselves in the " personal office " to obtain a single service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for their post reports and, without knowing, they will fall into a category of non-payers with all expiring consequences.
Access to the Personal Tax Office shall be carried out in three ways: through the accounting of the gosuslugi.ru portal, by electronic signature or input of the login and password listed in the registration map.
The latter can be obtained personally in any tax inspection office (despite the place of accounting).
Recall that transport tax must be paid until 1 December in the current year.
The sending of notifications began in July.
The Tunning Mercedes-Benz G-class, in which the advances are aimed at achieving a very high relief, is a matter.
However, the concept was not disturbed by the masters of the G-Power who had taken up for the modification of Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its dependency on BMW cars, but nothing human to her masters is strange.
Indeed, why not improve G 63-571-powered flying covald with aerodynamic tank and rapid to a hundred per 5.4 c?
With the muscles of a mad helicopter, the master used the advantages that opened a 5.5-litre suppression.
But the race dynamic has improved to a hundred to 0.1 c, and the flying tube is now capable of a ripping for 5.3 c.
However, the acceleration with the average speed is probably better.
The speed ceiling scares: if the standard G 63 does not drive 210 km/h, then the tuniing cartridge with the deactivated e-launch is capable of exhausting 250 km/h.
Outside, the car is almost unlikely from its factory source, except for other wheel drives, 23-inch Hurricane RR size 305/35 ZR 23.
The Luxury Mercedes-Maybach analyzed the impressive conceptual bunch of 6 m long, which is presented under the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz will compete with the "green subbrand" BMW and will promote its electrical models under a separate trade mark.
In the coming years, at least four ecological news are expected.
