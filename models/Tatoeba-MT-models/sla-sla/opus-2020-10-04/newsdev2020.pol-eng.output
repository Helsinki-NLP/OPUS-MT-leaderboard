American Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35 planes
The U.S. Congress has not objected to this transaction 15 days after the approval of the Ministry of the State of Shopping by Poland by 32 multi-to-day hunters F-35, which means that the latest condition has been met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The decision of the Congress, although it was not unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After approving the sale by the Department of State, and now through the Congress, I can not see any more serious obstacles," said John V. Venable, senior advisor for the defence policy of the Washington, conservative to think of the Heritage Foundation tank.
The expert explained that the Federal Government, represented by the Department of State, must notify the Congress of any planned sale of weapons abroad for 15 days before the signing of the Agreement, if the value of such transaction, in the case of the sale of weapons to the NATO Member State, exceeds 50 million dollars.
The value of the proposed shopping transaction of 32 hunters F-35 by Poland is estimated at $6.5 billion. This amount covers technical and logistical costs, support equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 – if this transaction is finally finalized - will be the US Armed Concern Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the manufacturer of engines for F-35A concern Pratt and Whitney.
The proposals for the shopping of American hunters of the fifth generation of F-35 on behalf of the Poland authorities were submitted in May by the Minister of Defence, Major Blasztak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June this year during the meeting of President Andrej Dudy with President Donald Trump in the White House.
The implementation of this agreement, if it is finalized, will be preserved by representatives of the Pentagon under the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
As part of the FMS program, Poland has already acquired a Patriot anti-racket system.
The price of one F-35 hunter at the time of the purchase offer by Poland was approximately 89.2 million dollars without arms and technical assistance.
As the PAP reported by the US military experts who wanted to maintain anonymity, the price given in the preliminary negotiations was “a highest price, much higher than the price that would be negotiated”.
"The prices are rapidly falling, now the price of one F-35 is less than 80 million dollars, much less than the Eurofighter who has no advantage of F-35," said Venable.
The PAP speakers have expressed hope that the final negotiations of the transactions for purchase by Poland of US warplanes will be over this year.
The eventual participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction, or offset, will be discussed directly with US hunters producers F-35.

Nigeria: Attachment of police to school in Caduna, evacuation of 300 children
Caduna – The State Police Department in Caduna conducted yesterday an attack on the school of Mamu Ahmad Bn Hambal, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma, Rigasa, Igabi, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police claimed that children were in highly dehumanised conditions, and the school authorities deny this claim.
He said: “They are not telling the truth, because all the children were there under the permission of their parents.
Before the kids were taken to school, their parents signed the form.
The parents daily brought food to their children and knew what conditions they had.
We were incredibly surprised when the police arrived and the evacuation of children, as well as the elimination of the full food of the pupils delivered by the parents before the school was closed.
It's not right, because parents can testify if their children are in bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the former Commissioner of the Abdurrahman police, who once visited the school to verify the level of childcare, never had any objections.
He claimed that the kids were studying the Quran and nothing else.
However, a public relations police officer, Yakubu Sabo, believed that after transferring the state to the government, children would join their parents.
“They were held under dehumanised conditions on behalf of submission or acquisition of indigenous knowledge.
Many of them had scars on their back, which proves they were beaten.
That is why we are studying the school to meet its owner," he added.

Nikita Nikandrow, a Russian student of the University of Russia and China, Shenzhen MSU-BIT, said: “Thanking the BRI initiative, Russian students can study with Chinese students.
We can build new concepts and new enterprises together.
Rachel Rommeswinkel from the United States started a blogger's career in Dongguan and has over a million fans in Bilibili and Weibo.
She said in her films she would continue to share information on Chinese traditions, culture and technology.
Laticia de Lassus from France, head of JJB International Montessori AMI in Guangzhou, agrees that “the education of children is like jackets.
If you turn the first button wrong, the rest will never get in the right place.
The American of Chinese origin, Henry Xiao, believes that in the GBA itself, his company can benefit from many privileges regarding new rules, government policies and capital resources, and in particular talents.
Sean Choi from South Korea said that the kitchen of the Guangdong region is known throughout the world and the introduction of the Nanta Show in Guangdong was a good decision.
Stephan Moler, from Switzerland, who works at the Technical Director for Quality in Pearl River Pianos, believes that the secret of high-quality is established in properly performing simple work.

The Vice-Chair of the Civil Platform, Tomasz Semoniak, spoke with Polsat News about the affair with the head of NIC.

He can be a cultural minister for some entertainment matters, not head of NIK, or financial minister.
Not someone responsible for billions, for taxes," he said.
"This case is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Semoniak also spoke of Claudia Jachira's candidature.
"The PIS lists are Antoni Macierewich.
A man who didn't just say things, he was doing them.
He judged former SKW heads of spying for Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why don't anyone ask for Antoni Macierewich not to be in the letters?" he asked.
“The young people of us have different aesthetics.
I think that Jahira, who has already apologised for one of the things, also feels that she sometimes exaggerates.
Let's not make this a campaign problem," he added.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police supervisor in connection with the close relationship with Jennifer Arcuri
Independent IOPC police proceedings authority will examine the possibility of initiating an explanatory inquiry to the Prime Minister, whether during the conduct of a public office as mayor of London has been committed to abuse of criminal offences.
The Council of the Great London (GLA) stated in its statement that its supervisory inspector registered “the question related to the proceedings” of the Prime Minister in connection with the charges of preferential treatment of Arcuri, resulting from the connecting close contact.
“The ‘related question’ may be said when information shows the possibility of committing crime”, he said.
That doesn't mean that it was proven in some way.
IOPC will now consider whether the case is necessary.
The issue was addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of the police services in England and Belgium.
It was transferred to this police supervisory body because Johnson was then a comparable position by the police Commissioner and the Commissioner for Criminal Affairs.
Johnson denyed that, in connection with his close relationship with Arcuri, there were any irregularities.
He said earlier that he would apply to the city council and give details about his relationship with Arcuri, but he reiterated that the council was “convening on the wrong issue”.
The order is the result of the report “The Sunday Times” that Arcuri, a American woman who moved to London seven years ago, received 126,000 pounds from the budget money, as well as a privileged access to three foreign trade missions that led the Mayor Johnson.
As a result of this report, the government has freezed the grant of 100,000 pounds for the Hacker House Arcuri.
The government awaits disturbing questions on the verification procedure carried out before granting funds.
The Digital Minister Matt Warman said in the Gmin Chamber that the employees of his department “usually maintained due care” and that the company has a British phone number.
However, according to numerous reports, the number has been directed to the office in California, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is now to live.
The close relationship of the Prime Minister with the Businesswoman was “the secret of polyshinella to the staff. ”
The GLA's decision to direct the Prime Minister to the independent IOPC police office was unsatisfied at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of the surroundings, the government's representative is a “politically motivated attack” and its term, in front of the Conservation Party's conference, is“publicly political”.
“The supervisory inspector has not presented any evidence that confirms the charges, and the Prime Minister has not received a chance to answer him before the press message was published late Friday night”, the source states.
Neither citizens nor the media will be able to get into such a clear political statute.
Today, in the previous hours, the Standard journalists said that Johnson's close relationship with a businesswoman from California, assisted by the tourism and promotion agency in London, was “the secret of polishinel”.
The employees of the London & Partners (L&P) were higher, reminding that Arcuri received places during Johnson's foreign trade trips, despite the fact that her company was not considered “very-fair”.
Third accused of drug offences due to Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – In the light of the last year's death of Mac Miller, a third man was arrested and charged with drug offences.
According to the judicial documents, Stephen Walter suspects the sale of fake oxicodon pills of fentanyl, which Miller had in his possession before he died in September last year as a result of accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, or a strong opioid responsible for “epidemia ” that absorbed several thousand human beings in the United States.
Walter's accused of delivering pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The judicial documents sealed on Tuesday reveal that Pettit received drugs from Walter throughout August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havas City, Arizona, is suspected of doing the role of the courier Walter, who delivered the pills to Pettit.
None of these men were directly accused of the cause of Miller's death and none of them presented the defense line in his case.
Walter's conditional release on drugs from 2005 is in custody and has been sentenced to a five-month sentence for dismissal.
The prosecutors dealing with the case that was first reported on Thursday by the web site dedicated to the celebrites of TMZ, demand that Walter remain in custody in the expectation of the process, claiming that there is a serious risk of escape of the accused.
The reply to the message left on the automatic secretary of his lawyer did not come immediately.
Pettit was charged with the federal court on 4 September, and his defendant refused to comment.
The words of Miller's rhyme songs are a genuine conversation about his depression and drug use, making him acquire fans from the largest hip-hop stars.
He was from Pittsburgh Miller, who was really named Malcolm James Myers McCormick, who spent two years in connection with Ariana Grande's songmaker, finished earlier in 2018.
After his death in the Instagram portal, she published an exciting film with Miller's part and the "Thank U Next", in which she mentions it with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been connected with the abuse of opioids in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitar team 3 Doors Down, also died as a result of overdose in 2016, and his body found the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodon.
This article introduced a change: Walter’s correct name is “Stephen, ” not “Steven.”
9-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 games for mobile devices
9-year-old creates a game of fun in hiding with a free application for programming Scratch 2.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories online or offline.
So far Basil generated more than 30 games for mobile devices.
There's a batch in the game today that's hiding according to the program.
The player wins a point every time he catches a net that gets out of the hiding room.
I learned how to create games on a speedy course.
"Now I create them when I'm bored," Basil CNN said.
In March, my dad recorded it on a 5-day accelerated course for children aged 5 to 15 years.
The course organised by Codefest International was intended to provide children like Basil access to new technologies, such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Opara senior, claims that Basil played many games on mobile devices.
“When he was four years old, I bought him a tablet because he always grabbed the phone and played it.
He played a lot in Candy Crush and Temple Run," said Father CNN.
But Basil's interest in creating games increased when he was seven years old and received a storm for all the time to play games.
"One day he played on the tablet as usual, and he was so absorbed that I was upset," said my father.
From anger, I said, “you still play, can you not think of creating your own games so that others can play it?"
Speaking these words, I was upset and I didn't think he would take them seriously," he added.
From then on, Basil was actively interested in creating own games, prompted his parents to buy the laptop and write it to the course where he learned the foundations for the creation of games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives its groom titles based on their contents.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available in Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes innovation leadership in the continent.
Two nigerian 12-year-olds have recently been famed for using codes to create robots dividing their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from the Ghana Women's High School won Robofest 2019 for programming robots for drawing boxes.
And thanks to the growing investment of giants in the field of technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and his peers are on their way to the coding star career.
Former President of the Republican Party in Northern Caroline will confess to a lie about corruption
According to the documents submitted on Friday, the former President of the Republican Party in the Northern Karoline confessed in the court that he lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of the principal political donor.
According to Robin Hayes' vacancy, she's going to confess to her guilt next Wednesday.
The document containing a real basis prepared under the defence agreement and signed by Hayes' lawyer indicates that Hayes knew that he was making a false statement to the FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defence agreement was sealed, and on the actual basis, there is no evidence that Hayes' charges would be confessed.
He was first accused of conspiracy, corruption and false testimony.
The prosecutors accused the former Congressor Hayes of participation in the insurance company's insurance authority plan to lead taxes to a campaign to the main insurance market regulator country in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two colleagues were accused of attempting to buy the state Commissioner for Insurance by Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of the insurance and investment company, as one of the major political donors in recent years, who has transferred over 5 million dollars to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He was mainly supporting the objectives and policies of the Republican Party, but he also provided taxes to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not answer the Friday mail with a request for comment.
The defendant of Hayes Kearns Davis did not respond to the Friday mail with a request for comment.
According to the documents submitted on Friday, Hayes lied to the FBI agents in August 2018 when he said that he had not spoken with Causey about the State Insurance Department.
In accordance with the document containing the actual basis, Hayes actually spoke to the Commissioner for Insurance on Lindberg's request to make changes in the staff employed by the market regulator.
Prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg organize a meeting with Causey and that he was talking about bribes directly with the regulator.
In accordance with the April Act of the Prosecution, Lindberg required special treatment of his insurance activities and planned to transfer up to $2 million to the new Causeya campaign in 2020.
The accusation act indicates that the contract also requires the change of the official of the department who controlled the Lindberg company.
The Republican Causey reported an apparent attempt to corrupt the federal agents and helped them collect evidence on the case.
He wasn't charged.
According to the law of charge, Lindberg's colleague ordered Hayes to transfer $250,000 to the Causey campaign during a conversation with Lindberg and Causey.
During the interview, Hayes first protested, claiming that the transfer of such amount of money would attract attention, but, as a result of the accusation, he eventually renounced.
"Whatever you all want to do, we will do," Hayes said, according to the accusation act.
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
The prosecutor did not respond to an email requesting further information on the agreement.

Facebook with caring for users will hide for a favorite number
In the first time in the world of experiment, aimed at improving user feelings, some of the people who are using Facebook soon under the posts of others will not see the number of favorites, reactions and video displays.
Favorites will be hidden and visible only for the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test carried out on Instagram in July.
The new Facebook version launched on Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, director of Facebook Privacy in Australia, said that the change was a result of an examination of self-sensitivity and the opinion of professionals in the field of mental health that indicated that the number of favorites can be a tendency to compare with others.
“Out of many groups that cooperate with us to combat harassment, as well as mental health organizations were truly positive”, said Garlick.
The elimination of this number will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and quality of content, not on the number of favorites or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others through the platform will be more pleasant and will not be taken as competitiveness – she claimed.
Garlick assured that companies based on Facebook will still receive the same indicators and observations that had access to.
She said it was too early to be able to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as it happened with Instagram, when Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland were covered by the test.
Like in the case of Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there are no indications when the experiment ends and whether the change will be made permanently.
"The initial comments of the users on the new rules applicable to the Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to opinions," she said.
Speaking of the World Experiment site, Garlick said that Australia has very active, technically familiar Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an incredible country that will provide us with measurable opinions showing whether the new experience is valuable for those who use our services or not.
Frequently: Advisers want compensation for pilgrims
The frequent chicken has not yet commented on the advisory invitation to the metropolitan Abpa Waclawa Depo to transfer the financial compensation for the maintenance of the waste economy in the farming season.
The city claims one bad of a peegrim.
On Friday at the press conference, he spoke of the spring leader Robert Biedroni, organized on the direction of the Clear Mountain of the Frequent Virgin, Vice-President of the City Council and candidate to Seim Lukas Cat.
Cat informed that a day earlier the SLD council voted to the Abpa Waclawa Depo for the transfer of a city of one gold from each visitor of the frequent pilgrim – to support urban, community services, etc.
We accepted an appeal to the Archbishop Depo to help the city, help us clean up the pilgrimages, prepare a city for peels.
“We ask for a transfer to the budget of the symbolic city of gold from each peelgrim.
This will enable the city to provide them with better conditions in Čestochov," the Vice-President of the City Council said.
The frequent metropolital courier Major Bakalar initially prepared a multiple reply, but then asked – how he signed, on the command of the abp. Depo – to replace it with information on the content: “We do not refer to the city's official position.”
In accordance with the project set out on the participating magistrate's pages, the Appa Depo apple refers to “reference of the financial compensation to the city of Frestoch for the maintenance of the communities waste management system during the farming season”.

"In addition, with regard to the participation in the annual costs that the city will cover from its own resources, taking care of the purity and aesthetics of the urban space, and also to emphasize that such cooperation will benefit for all parties, we declare that 20% of the amounts will be intended to improve tourism infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of public toilets available," the Council announced.
They noted that, in addition to the financial issues, their proposal is based on the many objections reported by the inhabitants on the state of cleanness of the routes that they are moving by pilgrims.
“Bearing in mind the cleverness of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the Council of Frequent City calls for the archibishop of the frequent metropolitan Waclawa Depo to transmit the financial compensation for the city of the frequent city for the maintenance of the communal waste management system during the peelgrim season," it was repeated in the appeal.

TVP "Wires" passed the Confederation in the description of the surveillance
According to Pollster's study, he would have received 45% votes, KO 26%, Levica 14%, PSL 7%, and Confederation 5%.
Even on the “Super Express” portal, for which the probe was carried out, is written on the electoral threshold.
The main issue “Wires”, describeing the same prob, represented only four first parties, completely over the Confederation.
The leader of Lewandowska emphasized that only four committees crossed the electoral threshold and entered the Seim.

Those “rights”, “independent”, “needless”.
In a few years, they became a more primitive version of all that they said they were fighting," he added.

Brother sentenced to life's punishment for the honourable murder of the social media stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star because of the pictures published in social services, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of the Pakistan social media star, Qandeel Baloch, was found guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to a lifetime prison as the loudest in this patriarchal country of “honor murder”.
Baloch, who was famous by publishing brave selfie – decent according to Western standards, but in mizoginic Pakistan considered provocative, was choked in July 2016.
Her brother, Muhammad Vaseem, was arrested.
A few days later, he said during the press conference that there was no condemnation for his actions and said that “of course” he killed his sister and that her behavior was“ unacceptable. ”
His lawyer Sardar Mehmood told AFP that the west court in Multan considered his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-expected judgment.
“Inshallah (if God allows), will be liberated by the Supreme Court of Instance," he said.
Earlier, Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, announced AFP that she hoped her son would be liberated.
"He is innocent.
It was my daughter, and this is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder has struck the leads of world information services and has renewed calls for action against the epidemic of honour killings in which victims — usually women — are killed for breaking patriarchal social principles.
Women were burned, suffocated, they were fired or bound for such offences as choosing their own husband or -- as in the case of Baloch – for bringing their family “shame” by manifesting their own sexuality.
Murders are usually done by a close relative.
Pursuant to the Pakistan law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (reply) may request the nearest victims to forgive.
Three months after Baloch was murdered, Parliament adopted a new legislation imposed a prison for honourable murders.
However, whether the murder will be considered a honourable crime remains in the judge's gesture, which means that killers can theoretically call on another motive and be denied.
In the case of Baloch, her parents first pressed their sons not to show grace.
However, those who feel that they may also lose him, change their mind and say that they want him to be deprived.
The international agitation caused by the murder has caused the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and to declare itself as a successor, along with their parents, making the case move forward.
One of the more famous achievements of Baloch is the offering to make a strip in front of the Pakistan cricket team and the establishment of a deculted purple dress in Valentine.
She was criticized and threatened, but many, including young people, viewed her as a breaking restrictions in the country where the position of Kim Kardashian could be considered bold and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
The “honour” roots of murder are in tribal social standards that continue to dominate in South Asia, and in particular normalize the behaviour of women, although men can also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of resettled from north-west Nigeria to 40 000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations organization stated that increasing violence has caused a double number of people moved from north-west Nigeria to about 40,000 people in the last four months.
The UN Refugees Agency found that the concerns have created a “new exceptional humanitarian situation” which requires an interagency effort to gather up to the end of the year for new funds of $35.5 million.
Babar Baloch, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Refugees, said that the Islamic Grouping of Boko Haram, which has been leading up in the northern country since the decade, has not been responsible for the last attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina observed in the past 10 months is rather a result of organized armed groups.
"It reduces the scary image of anarchy and uncertainty," he said to the journalists on Friday.
He informed the frequent reports of abductions, torture, forces, murders and sexual assaults from attackers who also destroy houses and robbery of cattle.
The army and the police were sent to fight the gangs in the region.
However, the army is distracted from the fight against Boko Haram and the branch of the Islamic State in Western Africa, which was separated from its former grouping in 2016.
"The refugees do not come with the names of groups," he said.
They're coming for it with monster stories.
Most of the refugees are going to the Neighbouring Niger.
In his statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that he expects more people to run to Niger in the coming months with a worse security situation, especially in the state of Sokoto.

A new date of trial was planned for a man from Guatemala accused of killing the apartment of Iowa and her two children.
The Court of Justice of the Polk states that 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellan is accused of three first-step murders under, as the authorities claim, the false name that he originally gave to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't admit it.
According to the police, he killed 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter and her 5-year-old son at their home in Des Moines on 16 July.
The judicial act shows that the new date of the proceedings, i.e. 27 January, will give the representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
The officials of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Services claim that Escobar-Orellana is staying in the United States illegally and has been deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted for an illegal entry into the United States.
"The Sun": Boris Johnson faced the rebellion of the office to reduce brexite requirements and achieve a compromise agreement with Brussels
Only three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the Prime Minister State, there are concerns that it is not enough time to acquire more important derogations.
Boris Johnson is facing the risk of rebellion by the office to reduce demands for brexite and achieve a compromise agreement with the EU.
There was an impass in the negotiations on a new customs system which would be a substitute for the backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels has identified the proposals for other provisions proposed by Johnson as “unexecutive”.
The Crown Ministers expect the EU's decision-making leader, Germany Angela Merkel, to offer the criticised Toris leader compromise as a three-year time limit for the implementation of the backstop mechanism at the latest moment.
The Sun journalists talked to three different ministers of the office, all of whom are preparing to confront with the Prime Minister after the annual toris conference next week in Manchester.
They will require the prime minister of the "aggressive" strategy developed by his close consultant, Dominic Cummings, to try to bluff against the EU and to threaten the leaving of the Union without an agreement and then accept the offer submitted by the Union at the latest moment.
One of the cabinet ministers stated a crushing verdict of the Supreme Court on Tuesday to conclude parliament's suspension as “warning signal” and added: “The only way to leave the European Union is to do it on the basis of the agreement.
We'll never beat the arithmetics in the Gmin Chamber, which works for our disadvantage.
The Prime Minister must now be screwed up and accept what he can receive.
Aggression does not pay: it is obvious that the Cummings plan burned on the pancake.
We can't fight on so many fronts.
The second minister of the office has committed to sending Johnson to try and pushing over the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresy May, unless everything else is said.
The minister said: “If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to reiterate the agreement offered by Theresa May in the Gmine Chamber. ”
There are numerous chances for her vote, and everyone is very interested in the end of this subject.
If we're forced to extend the term, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major dismissed Boris Johnson that he was not taking the negotiations seriously.
The first minister from the Toris shoulder said in a huge speech: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants agreements with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels working on it.
Instead, he's raped with bulls in Scotland, checking eggs in Wales and arguing with citizens on the main streets of towns – everything in the eyes of the world, as if the election campaign has lasted for good."
The current Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the agreement was still far away, and he added: “No one should have a fraud: to ensure agreement a very long way. ”
However, the prosecutor also said that the Benn Act, which introduces a three-month brexite delay in the absence of the agreement, "activatedly weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: “The law has no doubt a problem with negotiations, but despite it, the prime minister and his colleagues are still trying to make progress. ”
The Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay returns to Brussels today, where he will have more talks with Michel Barnier on the EU.
They will discuss a book on how the zone functions for all Ireland for food and living.
The dog with no nose and legs is in the way of Instagram.
Perfectly imperfect
He was supposed to be asleep.
However, it was possible to prevent it.
The bitch was transported from Romania to Britain by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The picture of the dog was published on Facebook.
Kate Comfort has fallen in love with a animal since the first look.
"I had difficulty at first to convince my husband to adopt because we had three dogs," she said.
The woman decided to take care of her bitch until someone adopts her.
However, no one still signed up.
“The fact that no one wanted her has made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," she told Kate.
Finally, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her as she is, and if anyone doesn't like what she looks like, it's his problem, not ours," the woman said.
Bonnie became a social media star in time.
Instagram observes more than 14,000 internauts.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that with a speaking accent I would never make a career on TV
According to Lorraine Kelly, television chiefs said that because of the accent from Glasgow, “he will never make career” as a presenter.
Speaking of her 35-year-old career in Kelly's TV industry, 59 years old, she admitted that before her first show on the screen, she felt “great nervous. ”
"I was only 25 years old and I was very nervous," she said.
When I worked at BBC Scotland as a search and checking expert, the boss chief said that by my accent from Glasgow I'm never gonna make a success on TV.
I went to London to meet the whole TV team and watch the program's emission before I took my responsibilities at Glasgow's office.
I'll never forget the interview with the Beth Davis star conducted by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a Scotch TV correspondent in 1984, she started her career as a local reporter in East Kibride, Scotland.
Then she started running programs like “GMTV”, “ITV Breakfast” and “Daybreak” to later start with its morning Lorraine, which took the name from her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career will celebrate a special program, where she will mention her best remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret of her long television internship is “passion and enthusiasm ” and“ curiosity, ” and adds: “You must work hard.
Be fair and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be both interested and interesting.
When Kelly recalls the media reports that affected her emotions, Kelly states that it was “very difficult ” for her to relate to the inflammation in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families killed or injured children were watching our program live with Dunblane the day after the scary killing of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose 5-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we talked in her house for hours.
The whole meeting took place quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral.
She added that Kate and Gerry McCannam were “believably difficult ” in a brief time after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007, and that “he really admires their strength and courage. ”
They must deal with the pain because they do not know what happened to their beloved daughter, and also to bear the most disgusting comments of the trolls in the Internet.
I'm with them all my heart.
The 35th anniversary of work Lorraine Kelly will start at 8:30 a.m. on Monday, 30 September at ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
The Higher State Officer claimed that Vice-President Constantino Chivenga refused to accept the president's office submitted by the dead President Robert Mugabe at the top of the turn because he feared to be imprisoned in order to confirm the military's receipt of the military in November 2017.
As the Zimbabwe Independent reported last week, Mugabe offered the Vice-President Chiwenze to take the presidentship during negotiations with the army during the revolution.
However, the Higher State Officer stated in the social media that Chivenga did not reject the offer from fear, but since he reviewed the Mugabe plan to use it to prove it to the world leaders and the African Union (UA) that he actually lost during the turnover.
In the thread on the Twitter portal, which confirmed that the 37-year-old Principal Zimbabwe wished to transfer the power to Chiwenga vice-President, rather than to the President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, which state officials confirmed that he was a higher rank official in the Bureau of the President and the Council of Ministers, the intensive negotiations were being held at that time.
State officials claimed that Mugabe contacted Chiweng through one of his messengers, when he realized that the power was evading him.
The mediations between the military authorities and the dead former president were, according to the higher rank of the State official, three stages.
The official claimed that among the negotiators was President George Charamba, a person who then served as Head of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nhepera and a priest representing the bishop of Roman Catholic Fidelis Muconori.
The former head of the Bank of Reserve of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, was the next element since Mugabe sent him with a single mission to submit the Chairmanship of Chivenge, who was head of the Defence Forces of Zimbabwe (SOZ).
A man who was considered an African icon after his death even more than his life was considered in vain attempted to obtain from UA condemnation of military action, trying to encourage other African leaders to intervene.
The president's offer submitted by the dead (Mugabe) to the chief of the Defense Forces (SSO) Chivenge was not the choice.
"It was a desperate act to save the situation that has taken a dangerous speed, removing part of the family of the dead," the official (Jamwanda) wrote.
But there was also a little political temptation that helped the dead to reverse the situation in a completely non-diplomatic way.
Just remember that the chiefs said they did not distort or distort the constitutional order, which would cause their conflict with the UA's position on revolution.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that the SSO (Chivenga) would then swallow the bait, violently interrupting the claims of leaders that they did not break the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the U.A, which, as well as on the margin, was still highly confused by the whole situation and how to fit it into its theoretical turning taxonomy, would have no choice but to describe it as a turn, so the call for military intervention would be reliable.
This offer was made in such a spirit and with such calculation.
The officials claimed that Mugabe made this move when he realized that the defence forces were no longer willing to protect him.
They said that Mugabe was forced to sign a letter of resignation after warning the urinaire that he risked a linch like Kaddafi.
Army chiefs told him they wouldn't return guns against citizens if they were moving to his Blue Roof residence.
And at the same time, Mugabe had two desires, which were to save his family and prove that the military took power," the official added.
The modern SSO and the commanders have read the assumptions properly.
The envoy (Gono) who has transmitted this desperate message was given to understanding – through the powerful metaphor – that the tiri vemacwapa-macwapa (we belong to the Camuflaž sect, i.e. army), we are not politicians or we are not competitive at the political level, stated the higher rank of the state official.
State officials say that the military has informed the military commanders in the area through the Attaché who were in Zimbabwe that they are not intending to distort Mugabe, but to deal with the surrounding “criminalists”.
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to try Mnangagva again to return from the short exile in the South Africa, so that they could talk about the conversion and success.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe was also looking for help in the region.
The residents of the South Africa, which constitutes a key element of the process, not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because of the fact that the former President Jacob Zuma was President Sadc, had refused interventions, but clearly indicated that if the army attacked the house of Mugabe, as many times frightened in the background, the army of the South Africa will immediately appear in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and African leaders did not choose this route," said the Independent, a informant.
China needs strong leadership or will fall apart as a policy document states
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, because otherwise the country will fall apart, the government found in the paper on the policy issued on Friday on the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People's Republic.
The Chinese government's press office reported in a white book that the success of the country since the receipt of power by the Communists 70 years ago has been brought to the leadership of the party.
China takes a large area, has complex national conditions, but there are rarely difficulties in the administration.
The document recalls that without a single and strong leadership of China, they will move towards divisions and decline, which will be catastrophic for the world.
China's authorities have used a hard hand policy for long-term solutions, as in the case of prodemocratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the stability of the country.
The strong-handed President Xi Jinping, who will be head of the second anniversary on Tuesday on the world's size of the economy, has further strengthened the Governments of the Party and sanctions against those who may question the authorities at the end of 2012.
Xi is also supervising the military modernization programme that has ejected the region from balance.
The document stated that China is not trying to export its model of development or want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace, rather than hegemonia.
The Chinese have no genes of conquering other nations or domination over the world.
In modern times, China has been oppressed by great powers, and wars and anxieties have embarrassed them deeply for the cause of suffering; China will never cause any suffering they have experienced.
China takes this anniversary in uncertain times for a country involved in a hurricane trade war with the United States and which faces challenges for the free economy and anti-governmental protests in the underministered China of Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never "trade" its most important interests or allow anything to harm their sovereignty.
With regard to the trade dispute of the country with Washington, the document stated that “threatening trade wars and further increase in customs tariffs do not lead to solutions to problems”.
China is an adult economy with a full industrial system, a complete chain of industry, a wide market and a strong economic growth rate.
The document added that “trade wars will never weaken it. ”
China is sure that they are able to face difficulties, the crisis to convert into new opportunities and open a new world.
It was also added that the United States should consider the development of China rationally, as China is not going to question the position of the United States, nor want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and even less likely they will stop China's development.
The restriction and weakness of other countries and transmission of national misunderstandings abroad will not provide the United States with a strong position.
World of Jackiewich: Dubai, real face
The Dubai emirate is still searching for its own identity, broken between the beduin tradition, the religious islamic radicalism and the extremism of progressiveness.
This new trends of world tourism leaders raises imagination and desires, embarrassing the vainness of the rich snobistic hotels and attracting searching for the fortune of investors and traders with the status of tax paradise.
The websites infect the enthusiasm of this city of dreams, which is an exciting luxury temple and concentrate in the architecture of the 21st century.
The sands of the Emirates became the Eden for those who love the rest, the five-star hotels, the beautiful weather and the pools placed hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many are admired by the universal preciousness here, the appreciation of creative hyperactiveism and hysterical pursuit of avangarde.
This is the city where the motto says everything: “Surprising, shocked, and charming. ”
And it's almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling them a city without nature.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the full of extremes and contradictions of the metropolitan has taken the dimension of grotesk. ”
She turned into a futuristic nightmare, completely dominated by the Guinness Book of Records, an unofficial Emirate Constitution.
Because everything here has to be bigger and more beautiful than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is a lack of something that may be little transparent in ancient Europe, but important to life quality.
In Wroclaw, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels like at home.
And not in Dubai.
Running away from the world of magic, I broke his golden mask, revealing the second face of the artificial paradise.
The counts that aren't spoken loudly and not written.
I'm showing the trouble of the Asians contrary to the ethnic conditions of the ethnic catastrophe of Dubai, the grandchildren of unwritten Beduin.
I'm starting to go to extreme poor places, for example to gette on the coast of the city, where, under cruel conditions, the army of Asian workers.
In one generation, they built Manhattan in slavery conditions.
They came here visited by good earnings and the possibility of providing a worthy life to their families, and they had a nightmare.
This tourist will never see, because it could blow it into the air created for years of Dubai.
The increasing criticism of the international community makes the subject of cheaper workforce becomes very troubled for the emergency.
Mel C from the Spice Girls team banned at her house talks about diets after her fighting with nutrition disorders
Melanie Chisholm, from the Spice Girls team, admitted that there is a ban on the use of diet in her home after her own food disorders, eating only fruits and vegetables for years.
Sports Spice has not been eating and “trained obsessively ” for years because of the pressure associated with being a famous member in the world of the pop group, which has later caused depression and nutrition disorders.

"Scarlett is now 10 years old and I begin to see that she is more aware of her appearance," Mel said.
"I believe that one of the positives of experiences with food disorders is that I am very aware of how I speak with it.
The use of a positive language has now become my skill.
In an intelligence for the Women's Health Mel magazine, who was famous in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that, in the days before the social media were formed, the "revolutionary" comments on it had caused complexes.
"I started looking at myself in an inadequate way, quitting from certain food groups, practicing more obsessively until I began to have disadvantage," he says.
"I was sick, and it probably took a few years."
A picture that shakes the world
Polish girl and American documentary gave the world a witness to the cruelty of war.
Legendary picture of Julien Bryan can be seen in the Museum of World War II in Gdańsk
"Listen to my story.
I'm talking from the surrounded city of Warsaw.
I can and I have to speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America has to act, has to help!" he started his radio activist, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In the tragic, September days of 1939, he was in the capital of Poland, seeing the drama of the bombed city and its residents.
His relationship reflected a wide echo in the West.
The President of Warsaw Stefan Starzinsky first helped him, borrowed the car, but then asked him to leave for his own security immediately.
Bryan wrote a letter of goodbye to his family in the U.S., deposed it in the embassy safe, and... he stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be everywhere where the warsawers were.
400 planes and artilleries almost attacked the city.
Bryan perpetuated death, suffering, struggle for survival in the city's muds.
Right before capitulation, he and his embassy employees took negatives out of the ocean.
He didn't stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What happened to Warsaw will be Paris, London, and even New York. ”
His exciting chronicles saw President Eleonor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began preparing for war.
"Father showed the truth, and thus he fought German propaganda.
They were making films glorifying their knighthood.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," said Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
A trial against the jury against the former athlete accused of numerous rapes
In front of the jury, there is a trial on the rape of the former baseball team of the Delaware University, which is being charged with a number of sexual attacks on the background.
On Friday, after 10 days of deposition and hearing of arguments, the jury members joined the determination of the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway.
The 21-year-old woman claims that Conaway raped her when she went to his house in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the two of these two contacts were concluded on the Bumble meeting site and the sending of a woman by a man's photo on which he was naked.
The woman is one of the six accusing Conaway of sexual assault in 2013-2018.
The prosecutor believes that the hug that a woman has agreed to was rape, which happened to her objection.
The defenders call on the opposite relationships of women and gaps in their memory and claim that the woman was likely regretted that there was an intimate approach.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for a million gold
The gold bike worth a million golds could be seen on the jubileus, 10th edition on the International Bike-EXPO bielce bike.
It's an extraordinary vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His designer, 30-year-old Adam Zdanovic, just received a bike Oskar for him at the World Customs Bike Exhibition in Las Vegas.
The unexpected copies made a furore on the markets. - The bike is covered with a gold crush chrome, underneath it is the highest silver test.
It's an unlike shell made by my colleague from Hor.
“It's a seat, there's peppers, there's a driver, and it could be normally driven.
It can develop a speed of 50 miles per hour.
It's a electric bike," the constructor says.
“Carroseria of the bike was printed on the 3D printer.
It's a cube forming a type of faith.
I figured out this model's idea on my first bike home, a few years ago.
I draw it on my card, and I hide it deep into the drawer.
Scic's been waiting for five years to realize.
The bike itself was formed for three years," Adam Zdanovic added.
"It was cruelly difficult to hide all the elements under the carosery.
There's batteries in the middle, cables, elements that make the construction.
It's hidden under the carores in 11 elements on the steel bike frame.
There's also a engine hidden there.
The driver came to this bike for a week before I left the United States for the World Bike Exhibition.
I couldn't definitely decide what this driver was supposed to be.
She's composed of transport.
The bike weighs 90 pounds," summarizes.
The gold bike was appreciated in Las Vegas's most important competitive category “The Best Unbelievable single customary copy”.
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist places
Sydney Bay surrounded by the opera building, the Circular Quay port, the Luna Park entertainment park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge Bridge is an important contribution to $21.9 billion, a yearly embarked in the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But there is ugly truth under the bridge.
The famous Sydney bay is one of the most infected waterways in the country that affects the volume of pollution every year equal to the capacity of about 15 Olympic pools.
These frightening statistics make one of our biggest tourist artists at the same time one of our dirtyest aquanas.
According to the new film material entitled “Sydney Bay — up and down, ” waters in the most popular city of Australia are filled with minorities, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, and all of this flows to the bay along with rainflows.
However, the largest part of our navigation channels is plastic.
“I would call it paradox”, says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, Deputy Director of the Research Programme Sydney Harbour Research Programme, published in September 27, and the publication of this film is deliberately collaborating during the World Tourism Day.
This Aquen looks beautiful, but it is one of the most modified and contaminated to walk the rivers along our coast.
The CSIRO estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic is available to our waterways, and its majority affects the bay through the storm sewer.
"After such a powerful fall of the bay... it looks pretty tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two-thirds of pollutants come from rainwater.
However, as in the ice mountain, the problem with the Sydney Bay is much more serious under the water surface, since 70% of the plastic flowing to the ocean reaches the bottom of the sea.
"I think if you don't spend time under water, you can't really realize what's in the deeper," said Richard Nicholls, owner of Dive Centre Manly, noting that he and his team are self-extracting about 500 kg of plastic a year from the water.
I think if more people knew (what is under water), they would be just scared.
It's surprising... more than half of what we find on the bottom are plastic networks.
The rest of 50% are things that are at least made of artificial.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and the rest of the garbage we get right below the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-master and director of the Ocean Protect, found out that there are ways in which people — both local and tourists — could help to reduce the amount of plastic and remains that pass into our waterways.
"This must begin with the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic used by us, better manage the recovery of materials and have a greater awareness of what we're dropping in the garbages that eventually fall into the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we'll be destroyed because 50% of our breathing oxygen comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of carbon dioxide and our food source.
However, we can arrange this bay and restore it to old excellence, which is very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we'll kill ourselves.
The film material financed by the TOMRA recycling company in its broader efforts to educate Australians in the field of environmental protection and reduce the negative impact of beverage containers on beverages that often fall into the environment, is collaborated during an examination of the dependency between artificial and mental health, which has been published this month.
A new survey carried out among 546 children aged 12 to 18 has concluded that 82% of respondents feel helpless to waste from artificial materials and 25% of adults are guilty of waste with one-time plastic packaging.
The study revealed that waste of plastic waste waste was also fourth of the size of parent's fear, and 93% of 551 parents surveyed said that their concerns were growing with the number of plastic waste flowing to the oceans.
Many who participated in the study said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental fear.
Poland – Slovenia.
Memos after the networking game in me halffinal
It wasn't a easy game.
The Slovenians had a natural public on their own, which effectively deconcentrated Polish networkers.
Many controversies were also raised by judges who did not count four people on the side of the household.
This happened at the key moment of the first set, when the Vital Hayne's guardians had the chance of jumping off against the rivals and wining the first party.
But it didn't happen, and the Poles finally had to recognise the superiority of the rival, which after winning 3:1 will play the finals of the tournament.

Google creates a cloud in Poland.
PKO BP Partner
National Cloud Operator, PKO BP and PFR, has concluded a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation should help Polish companies to implement and use the potential of the computing cloud technology.
The Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the National Cloud Operator offer, and Google will open in Warsaw the so-called Google Cloud region – the hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the Central-East Europe region.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global, public cloud calculation in Central Europe.
The digitisation of Polish companies was one of the key foundations that were based on the project to create the National Cloud, initiated and developed by the PKO Bank of Poland and the Polish Development Fund, the shareholders of that company.
The Partnership of the National Cloud and Google is another important step on the road that we faced a few years ago, announceing the call of the National Cloud Operator.
The goal remains unchanged – the digitalization of the Polish economy and the dynamicization of its growth.
“Now the Polish companies are gaining additional, advanced tools for its implementation.
By using them, they increase their chances of promoting the world's league, which we all care about.
The fact that they are joined by Google today is essentially strengthening our joint project," said Zbigniew Jagnjelo, PKO President of the Polish Bank.
The Polish Development Fund notes that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern sectors and businesses.
“Investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideally included in the PFR strategy as an essential element of digitalisation of the country.
It will provide modern and accessible price solutions to entrepreneurs based on the cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and will bring to it the best specialists," added Paul Borys, President of the PFR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on the leading technical infrastructure, providing calculation and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all key products of Google Cloud Platform such as Compute Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner or Big.
Inclusion of Google Cloud services to the National Cloud offer allows Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that their global competitors use.
But thanks to us, they will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," Michal Potoček, President of the National Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as IoT, which repeatedly increase the need for calculation power necessary for the processing of huge data collections.

Tasmanese diabetes may provide guidance on cancer treatment
Tasmanese diabetes may have a key to cancer treatment – researchers have made a breakthrough discovery that can revolute therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered a way of masking certain cancer cells
The researchers found that the same process is in the Tasman devils and in humans.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new oncological treatment methods
What do Tasman devils and people have in common?
Cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolution therapy of some cancers if they do not respond to immune therapy.
It may also contain a key to the treatment of mortal tumors in the face, threatening the future of the threatened Tasman devil.
The study established a way of masking certain cancer cells both in humans and in bags, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which excludes a marker that would otherwise signal the immune system to attack cancer.
This may be the greatest challenge in the treatment of minor cell cancer of lungs, neuroblastoma and the type of skin cancer called Mercla cell cancer.
"The great importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immune therapy resistance, we can be able to reverse this process," said the AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapy can be addressed to re-inclusion of markers, proteins called MHC, which will enable the immune system to identify cancer cells.
"This potentially has long-term implications for people with lung cancer," Professor Dawson said.
"It is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we'll be able to treat her much better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will be used once to treat the face of the tasmanian devil’s face, where cancer cells are similarly avoiding detection.
"It's unusual that the same process is happening (in the case of cancers in people and the Tasman devils)," said Professor Dawson.
"How difficult it was to treat Tasmanian devil tumors so far.
But if human-functional medicines can also be used in the Tasman devils, there is a possibility that it will help control the disease."
Scientists are surprised that there is a very large planet around a really small star.
Scientists express the surprise of the discovery of a solar system of 30 light years from the Earth, which contradicts our current understanding of the processes of the creation of planets, because in this system a large planet similar to Judah is circled around a small star called red carl.
The artistic illustration of the planet type of gas giant GJ 3512b circulated around the central star as a red carl, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, stars are much bigger than even the biggest planets around them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case, the star and planet are slightly different.
The size of the star named GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the sun, while the mass of the planet around it is at least half of the mass of Jude, the largest planet of our solar system.
“Yes, this is an absolute surprise” said astrophist Juan Carlos Morales from the Catalonic Institute for Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, who was headed by the research published in the Science magazine.
The discovery is surprising because theoretical models of solar systems suggest that stars with low mass of rule become mate stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.
“In this case, we discovered a planet of gas type with a giant like Jupiter circling around a very small star”, added Morales.
The planet, which, like Jupiter, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope in the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It circles its star after a very eliptical orbit, and the full circulation lasts 204 days.
Red bullets are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only much smaller than the sun, but to a certain extent, it is comparable to the size of a very large planet, because it is only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are fatter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below 3800 (step) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheita / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have red color," said Morales.
“There is evidence of the existence of the second planet circling around this star, while the third planet could be thrown out of the star system in the past, which could translate the eliptical orbit of a planet similar to the Judea”, said Morales.
Planets are formed from the same star gas and dust that produces a star around which the planets are circling.
According to the leading model of the creation of planets called a model of action, the object is originally formed from particles of steady in the disk, and the force of the planet's gravity in the early stage of development allows the atmosphere to be emerged from the gas surrounding.
This unusual system can explain a competitive model called a model of gravity instability.
“In that case, the proto-planetary disk around the young star can be a little massiveer than we expect and may be cold” said Morales.
This leads to a disability of disk stability, so some dense areas may appear.
These mass can grow up until the moment the planet falls and creates itself.
A delicate worker accused of the use of a mushroom collaborator containing metamphetamine
The Sheriff's office in Marion County held Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years old, for a collaborator of the faggot dip containing metamphetamine.
On Thursday from Albania, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was accused of providing metamphetamine and causing the consumption of this substance controlled by another person – both crimes are crimes of the second degree.
The charge was issued on the basis of the 9th September event in the Thriftway food shop in Jefferson.
In the portal obtained by OregonLive.com of the statement made under the oath that indicates the probability of guilt, a 27-year-old suspect colleague told the deputy sheriff of the district Marion that during the lunch break she saw Medina-Hernandez make a beans dip to which she then bought it.
On the basis of the statement, a victim of crime, which according to what she reported to the investigator, never took the metamphetamine, was known to say that “she thought that one of the pieces that had eaten by it tasteed strangely, but did not raise any suspicions. ”
When she returned to work, she felt she had a stomach and she couldn't stop on her feet.
According to Albania Democrat-Herald newspaper, she went to a local hospital where it was established that the pigeon dip could contain metamphetamine.
On the basis of the Smoking Gun portal, according to the police, another employee of the Thriftway network said that Medina-Hernandez “which told her to add drugs to food”, while another confessed that the suspect sent her a message, claiming that the metamphetamine had arrived in a faggot by accident.
The OregonLive website informs about the monitoring recording from the delicates, which apparently shows how it's turned back to Medina-Hernandez camera pulls something out of the biustone, stands behind the microwave and leans.
Then it just goes, wipes the nose, approaches the table and bed of the beans in a small paper vessel.
According to the police, the thing that she pulled out of the biustones was also probably on the plate.
The Stateman-Journal newspaper states that sheriff's office employees claim that there is no suspicion that customers are given contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County prison – the bail is $520,000.
According to the Smoking Gun portal, its extensive police record indicates that a woman has already been sentenced for attack, robbery, identity stealing, supplying metamphetamine, stealing, possessing metamphetamine and possessing unauthorized weapons.

Marian Banah.
What's KAS doing about the boss of NIC?
The rental of real estate is a amount below the market price – these are the objections that appear in the case of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control of Marian Banasia.
About what the treasury is doing in this case, we asked in the Treasury Administration Chamber in Krakow and the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel presented doubts about the estate statements of the President of the Supreme Control Chamber of Marian Banase.
He's been studying the Central Anticorruption Office for a few months.
The control is to end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banah was to rent a stone of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In fact, he received 65.7 thousand gold for it a year.
The Supervisier report revealed that the stone that he rented was located in a hotel for an hour.
The head of NIK later explained on state television why he only took over 5 thousand gold per month for rental.
“The electoral newspaper”, calling on experts on property estate, estimated that it should be 15,000 gold on a month after the stone itself.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I have concluded a preliminary agreement and the fact that the mercenary had to buy this stone, caused me to agree on the lower rent that the other duties would be calculated at the sale of the stone," Banja convinced.
However, there have been doubts whether such proceedings are not a violation of the law.
Conrad Zawada, a press prosecutor of the Treasure Administration Chamber in Krakow, in a television with TVN24 informed that “the Ministry of Finance is directly dealing with this case”.
"All such questions, please direct to the Minister of Finance," he added.
The claim explained that in such cases “the national Treasury Administration is running. ”
The press spokesman of the Ministry of Finance, Paul Jurek, admitted that the National Treasury Administration itself monitors a number of cases that may raise any objections.
“The Final Treasury Administration works in a way that has its own information, as well as it is based in some sense on those information that are available publicly.
On this basis, it decides whether there is a particular case to conduct any proceedings or not," the MF spokesman explained.
"But because we are all obliged throughout the finance resort, treasure secret is why we never express ourselves, because we cannot speak in individual matters of a specific taxpayer, a particular person or a particular company," Marian Banasia emphasized, asked about the case.
The Minister of Finance, Jerzy Kwecinski, emphasized that “the treasure authorities do not transmit to public information of this type of message”.
"We know that the whole treasure camera is dealing with very many similar cases throughout the country," he pointed out.
Royal family secrets: surprised guests often flying by royal aircraft
As part of the duty, members of the royal family have to travel hundreds of travel throughout the world throughout their lives.
This usually facilitates the royal plane — a private machine that drives the royal family around the world to important events and events.
It is not surprising that ownership of a plane is associated with privileges.
The members of the Royal family must not stand in long lines for delivery, their limits on the number of luggage and, as it turns out, may invite any guests, including truly unseen.
According to a recent premier on Channel 5 of the documentary film, the Queen and Prince Philip are often traveling by a royal plane.
During the Royal Flight Secrets program, the king’s navigator of flights revealed that he and his royal family frequently flyed with flying guests.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes along with our very important royal guests, they could fly very important royal dogs. ”
It is not surprising that the queen could demand that her loved favorites accompany her journeys, because she is known by her deep commitment to the dogs of corghi.
Since the youngest years, Queen Elizabeth has been a lover of these four - foot creatures and hears that since the coronation she has been owner of over 30 corgs.
It is said that in 2007 she had five corgs: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willowa and Holly.
Five cocker spaniels joined them: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, as well as four dogs who were a crusade of corgy: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The royal aircraft crew must have had full hands of work.
The Royal House employee was seen to take the dogs and ask them to settle their needs before taking them on the plane, says Shields.
I'm glad to say that there's never been any incident.
The programme also revealed the shocking number of baggages that the queen takes with her on board during the journey during the performance of the service obligations.
The Narrator of the film stated: “In 1953, the queen took a 12 - tonne bag on her 70,000 - mile trip. ”
To be able to show it better, it's more than two huge elephants.
But the queen is not the only person with fashion weakness.
The Princess Cambridge said also has its own preferences for the transport of her dress – it is said that every one of her dresses has a separate seat.
The new law comes into force.
Infected in accidents will receive rents
On Friday, there is a regulation to ensure that the rent is further damaged in cases, informed by the Finance Officer.
It is a law of 9 July 2019 on specific powers of persons damaged in the case of exhaustion of the guarantee sum fixed on the basis of the provisions applicable before 1 January 2006.
It concerns those who were damaged before 1 January 2006.
At that time, they committed decisively lower than the current guarantee amounts, and in some cases, the insurance officers have already stopped paying rent.
“I am pleased for this regulation, because our institution has long sought to create a mechanism that will allow the seriously damaged in cases to guarantee financial support from the communications or the OC of a farmer despite the exhaustion of the guarantee sum”, said Alexander Dashewski, a legal advisor in the Finance Office.
This was necessary by the Finance Officer, because these are often very tragic situations for people in a very bad health condition, which, for example, cannot work because of the accident and at the same time bear significant cost of accidental rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them no longer received balance rents and increased requirements for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of so-called guarantee sums on OC fields.
Parts of this threatened in the coming years.
By 1 January 2006, the insurance limits were significantly lower than current.
Therefore, the issue of exhaustion of the guarantee sum in the previous years was most commonly affected by those who suffered damage in the 1990s.
The guarantees were then very low, and economic conditions resulted in price increases.
"We also noticed that this problem has also affected a number of young people who have suffered damage during the period where the amount of EUR 350,000 for each injured accident.
At present, it is EUR 5.21 million for the event, regardless of the damaged number.
It is therefore a huge difference in the previous periods, and this is why the problem was required by the legislator's intervention," Alexandr Dashewski recalls.
It explains that, since the guarantee amount is increasing for a period of time, the legislator has accepted that the upper boundary of the liability of the Guarantee Guarantee Fund will be the guarantee amount in force at the time of receipt to the Remuneration Fund.
This principle shall apply if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay a remuneration on the basis of the judgment of the court fixing a different amount of the guarantee amount than set out in the OC insurance agreement.
This shall take place in the case of an increase in the guarantee in the judicial way, pursuant to Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows the modification of the existing commitment relationship.
“In the last days, we sent letters to those who in the past were asking us for intervention.
We inform them of the new powers and, of course, we ensure that we can provide further support in the event of any problems,” said Alexander Dashewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted for cutting off a penis boy
The case concerns the events of November 2017.
According to Buenos Aires Times, then Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed her friends a sextasm who came up in their bedroom.
A 28-year-old architect explained in court that the partner thus ruined her life and treated her as a trophy, which can be praised in front of friends.
"He broke my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything," she argumented.
Cordoba's own resident decided to measure justice.
She invited her boyfriend, a 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him she prepared a special surprise.
With the axamite belt, she covered his eyes, and then she grabbed the secator and cut off his penis.
"I felt like I was going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, pulled my pants and grabbed my cell phone to call the ambulance," he testified.
“I wanted to leave, but she started to offend me.
She grabbed me for my shirt and her hair, not letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend hurt her by exposing sextas, she didn't try to escape her responsibility.
"Please measure justice," she said to the jury.
Finally, she was found guilty of attempts to commit murder and was sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Congressman of the state of Alabama, Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, a retired congressman of the state of Alabama, from the Republican Party, Jack Edwards, who served in 10 offices and belonged to the first wave of the Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
The family secretary said that Edwards died in his house in Fairhope after fighting with the cancer of the turkey.
Edwards was originally elected to the US Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans from the state of Alabama in the Deep South because the party gained supporters here.
He served 10 offices in Congress.
According to the statement issued by the family in response to the recent question of what the world would like to leave to his lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he would like to return to courtesy.
"I hope that my lawyers and my grandchildren will grow up in a country where the joint debate and efforts to address the problems of the country will regain courtesy," Edwards said, according to the family statement.
The Governor of the State of Alabama Kay Ivey said that Edwards served his position and the country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that in his honor, the flags in the Alabama Capitol will be abandoned to half the mast.
"He was the personality of a true state official and was the best man of the state for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of the most famous politicians," Ivey said in the statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed high appreciation for Meghan Markle in Instagram on Thursday, calling the Duchess Sussex “the careful leader who breaks the schemes and making our world better. ”
The Princess and Prince Harry, currently taking a ten-day royal journey to South Africa with their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, participated in a meeting with the youth at the beginning of this week, while they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Royal Majesty, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, "the careful leader who breaks the schemes and which makes our world better," wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic post.
“Is this meeting with the leaders of the Obama Fund @ObamaFoundation, or helping girls around the world to access education they deserve, is an inspiration for many people," Obama added, incorporating a picture presenting the smiling Meghan with the leaders of the foundation.
Meghan conducted an interview with Obama for the September edition of the British Vogue, hospitally edited by the former actress of the Suits series.
The first lady spoke of maternity and how it changed her.
"Bying a mother means bringing you to the art of forgiveness," she said in Obama's intelligence.
“Maternity taught me that for most of my time, it is my task to give children space so that they can know the world and become who they want to be.
Not who I want them to be or who I wanted to be in their age, but who they are in the heart.
Obama, who knows from experience what the pressure of being on the candle, shared with the Princess Council during an interview with the Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The pressure that you feel, which is put on you and others, may sometimes be harassing you," she said.
"My advice is therefore to slow down and not rush.
For the first few months in the White House, I spent mostly on worrying about my daughter, making sure that they are doing good at school and making new friends before I was more ambitious.
I think it's necessary, too.
Hotel Trumpa maintains a license to sell alcohol despite the complaint of the owner's personality
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Commission for Alcohol Drinks Control in Washington revoked a request to see whether the local property of Trump International Hotel should lose the authorisation for sale of alcohol due to the ownership.
The Agency ordered on Wednesday that the complaint of three shepherds, two retired judges and two rabbis is unfounded because most of them do not live in district or have no real estate in it.
“The Washington Post” states that the second time they have tried to revoke the hotel's license to sell alcohol, calling on the district, saying that the applicants of alcohol authorisation must be “a good nature”.
The original complaint issued last summer was claimed that President Donald Trump breaks the law, and charges were charged with attacks and repeated fraud cases.
The complaint was dismissed because the authorisation was granted before it was lodged.
The reason for the second complaint was to extend the authorisation.
“The Sun: The inhabiting report considers the scandals of the police service in Cleveland as the worst in Britain
Inspectors recognised SCOMPROMIsed by Scandals the police as the worst in Britain.
In a collapsing report, they evaluated the police work in Cleveland as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley, from Her Royal Majesty's Chief Police Inspector, claims that the Cleveland police services had a “sensitive deterioration” of standards.
There have been new appeals to address police services, which have led five commanders within six years.
According to the report, the police did not try to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protection of the weakest.
Phil Gormley, from Her Royal Majesty’s Chief Inspector, said: “From our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration of standards. ”
Commander Mike Veale quit in January after a few years in the face of the investigation of "serious", however unexposed, charges on his proceedings.
The Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts was suspended after the arrest under surveillance.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood set up before the committee for offences for encouraging colleagues to sexual activity.
He left his office.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen, from the Toris arm, said: “It is officially confirmed that these services are compromised.
It's time for the Department of Home Office to intervene now."
Police Commander Richard Lewis said: “After making improvements, I take full responsibility for carrying out police forces by change. ”
We've got a visualization of the skatepark!
Do young people finally wait?
The elders are disturbed by young people who are passionate to ride on the hulayes and descorals, and they complain that there is no right place for them in Olawa.
For years, a young man has been reminding of a place to ride on rolls, descorals, hulaines, bikes.
The subject's still coming back to our breakfast.
We've been paying attention to this problem for ten years.
It's been loud again about the lack of the skatepark.
That's why we go back to this again and ask the office what's next?
We remind you that a woman who was disturbed by a youth riding in the center had spoken a few days ago.
"I write on behalf of the inhabitants of the Pl. Pilsudsky Block, so that you may be interested in the situation of the Olovak Youth," writes Malgorzat.
“The bloc residents have repeatedly called the City Guard ineffectively.
I'm sending photos to the proof of these daily situations."
We asked others about this.
Most of them clearly claim that young people simply have nowhere to ride in the city, and for years they have unsuccessfully demanded places for themselves.
Under the post on Facebook, even the lawina comments appeared.
We already wrote in July that there was a chance that the skatepark would be built in the Olova City.
The Mayor informed that the city was requested to finance the construction of the skatepark.
“The project, consulted with youth, together with the permits, is ready.
On 28 March, the Ministry of Sport and Tourism was requested to finance the task of the "Skatepark Building in Olawa" under the Sports Programme of Poland", we were told in the office.
Total value of the project: 798 306,00 z.
Supplied amount: 263 440,00 g.
Now we've asked again what stage the matter is.
"We do not yet have any information about the responsibilities of decisions to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for the subfinancing proposal," Elizabeth Bednarkich, Chief of the Division of European Funds, informed.
“The information received from the Ministry's employees indicates that the final choice of all tasks under the Sports Programme of Poland should take place in October.”
We also asked for a visualization of the Owl skatepark.
We'll present it below.
The youth informed the editor that on the next Saturday (28 September) they would be collecting signatures under the petition on the construction of the Scatepark in Olawa.
"The rebel youth saw the last post on Facebook and concluded that they would organize the collection," says Santa.
Signatures under the petition will be collected since 12:00 in the area of the Lidl market.
Poland Cup 2019/20: filing 1/16 finals.
We know couples, hit years ago
It was one of the biggest rivals in the extraclass.
The greatest legend was the memorial game of season 1996/1997.
On June 18, 1997, the Legia was taking an old stadium at the Lassienkian boat team in a larger row.
Both teams shared the point.
The masters had to win, the second of the spectacles of the Polish championship gave a point.
By 87th minute Legia drove 2:0, but for five more minutes the earthquake came – Vizew shot three naked and enjoyed the title.
The boat club with years had grown more trouble until he stopped counting for the championship and fell from the highest game class.
For the last time, both teams met at this level in season 2013/2014.
The Legia – on the way to the title – won two victories – 5:1 at her house and 1:0 on the exit.
Return to elite
At present, the boatmen are fighting for returning to the national elite.
These plans have been delayed at least a year because in the previous games, as one of the favorites, they have not been able to advance the rear extraclass.
As a result of this summer failure, the Club took place in a personnel revolution.
The authorities have changed, the coach Martin Kachmark, and the next step toward the club hierarchy is to help the marcin Robak and Matheus Možgen in league fights.
For now, Vizev is fourth in table II of the League, but in the Poland Cup, he defeated the vice-lider of the Extraclass Slask Wroclaw 2:0 on Tuesday.
The Legia, at the same size, has been declined on the departure of the Nepolombia.
Extraclass starts
The only couple composed of the highest class representatives in the 1/16 final form its LAC benymine and the Zabře Mountain.
The swords of this phase will take place on 29-31 October.
This year was planned to play 1/8 final (3 to 5 December).
The final is to be held on the National PGE in Warsaw on 2 May.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr "rebelled" and the investigation within the impeachment must run through its path
You never know where we're going.
Now, I think, we are participating in trying to hide facts of the attempt to hide facts, and the investigation may take a while," Pelosi said in the CNN intelligence on the Hill of Capital.
“They do the work they have started by keeping the facts and time necessary to find them,” she added.
From the protocol issued this week by the White House, Trump asked the President of Ukraine to conduct a investigation on the former Vice-President Joe Biden, a candidate of 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked Zleneski to take up cooperation with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as indicated in the protocol.
Trump denyed that he did anything wrong.
On Thursday, the CNN reported that the national security lawyers from the Department of Justice had notified the complaint notified by the Signalist on Trump's proceedings with Ukraine's participation more than a week before the formal statement.
After receiving a complaint in the form of a statement from officials from the Community Intelligence, the Department of Justice found that Trump's telephone call did not provide a criminal investigation on the funding of the campaign.
Asked whether Barr should testify, Pelosi found that on Friday the Intelligence Committee would decide who to call for a witness.
But she added that Barr “rebelled. ”
It's been a long time.
“Barra is exchanged in all of this,” Pelosi added, referring to Trump's mention of his general prosecutor during the July conversation with the leader of Ukraine.
Interestingly, he was making decisions about the way the complaint was considered.
Pelosi stated that “he is very afraid ” of the signalist informers whom Trump attacked as spys on Thursday, suggesting that in the past they were dealing differently with spy.
I think the words of the President are beyond irresponsibility, it's dangerous.
Our signalists play an important role in discovering – revealing offences in our government," Pelosi said, adding "The word of the President about the people who could provide information you signed seriously contests the honesty in the government."
On Tuesday, Pelosi took a historic step to declare a formal investigation on the conduct of an unlawful act based on attempts to pressure the foreign leader to obtain political benefits.
The telephone conversation was included in the composition published on Thursday, in which the signalist claimed that Trump abused his power to “provoke Ukraine to interference” during the coming elections 2020.
The signalist also claimed that the White House's lawyers had told officials to remove the accounts from the computer system in which they were stored for the needs of the Ministers Council officials and to put it in the system designed to be particularly sensitive.

Ghana: Kofi Manu concerned by the verification Commission structure
Kofi Manu, football manager and representative of the Secondi Hasaacas Club, reported doubts about the verification composition of the Commission for the arrival elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, adding that he is not satisfied with his participation.
In an intelligence with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts whether the Commission President would show fairness because the verification process is in his interest.
The verification Commission should consist of neutral persons outside who do not show any links to any of the members and who have no interest before.
For example, Davies hired the NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer in respect of payments for 10 per cent.
He is also a famous advocate of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the verification Commission because he has an interest in it," he said.
Manu said that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, will be a conflict of interests by the President, due to his relationship with the club, suggesting that if the Commission is stated by Palmer, it will be subject to prejudice and partyness.
According to the expectations, the members of the Commission were to start work since yesterday, after the oath during the GFA Secretariat in Acra on Tuesday, 19 September, and complete it on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and its members are the Corporate Consultant and Mrs. Marian Barnor and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwah.
Other members belong to Reginald Laryea, Marketing and Business Director and Richard Akpokavie, Sports Administrator and lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the government of unity
Two main parties of Israel, the Union of Blue and White and Licud, continued negotiations on Friday on the establishment of a government of unity.
The meeting that took place after the president's mission to form the government of Benjamin Netanjahu did not produce any results.
The discussions discussed the possibility of rotating both parties in the government and remaining Netanjah at the Prime Minister's position, but, as the Israeli journal Haarec writes, there was no approach to views.
Talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Union of Blue and White informed in the communication that he presented the preliminary postulates.
The right Licud accuses him of “bathing himself in his positions”, demanding that his leader and so far prime minister, Netanjahu, remain in the head of the government, and in the office, which is previously included in its ultra-ortodox politics.
"In the beginning, it was known that the Blue-Bial would not agree on these conditions," the communication was published by them.
Because, acting only in the interest of Netanjahu, he wants to “produce in Israel the second round of elections. ”
The leader of Blue and White Benny Gantz refuses to support the government he would lead Netanjah until he was charged with three corrupt affairs on which the prosecutor could formally accuse him after the Wednesday meeting.
“Likud and Blue-Biali have gained sufficient majority in the elections of 17 September, which would allow them to share their governments as natural allies, but it forces them to negotiations which no party wishes to do," the EFE agency wrote.
President Reuven Riwlin was trying to bring up their positions in the last days and suggested that the Prime Minister suspend his functions in time, which would allow Gantz to take this position if the charges against Netanjah were supported and formed.
There is no lack of Israeli analysts who believe that things were stuck in a blind street.
However, half of the Israelis, according to the report published on Friday by the public television, wishes to unlock the political situation in the country by calling the government for unity under the rotational leadership to transform Netanjah and Gantz.
For such a solution, 50.6% of Israelis, 32.1% of the surveys are opposed to such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in the Israeli society – the question of who should first be headed by the office, 41.8% of the respondents refer to Netanjahu, and 40% behind Gantz.
In another survey published by Israel Hayom, the percentage of unity members increases to 63%, 60% is contrary to new elections that would be third this year.
In the pre-term parliamentary elections, on September 17th, Gantz's alliance won 33 mandates in the 120-local Knez, Likud Netanjahu struggled 32 mandates.
Netanjahu and his traditional and potential allies can count on supporting 55 ambassadors, while Gantz – on 54.
No party has gathered 61 mandates required for most.
Typuric calls for a fight before the final game with Australians
Justin Tipuric says that it is “time to be verified” when Walia is facing the final game with Australia within the World Couch, which can form their fate in the tournament.
The Belgium's victory on the “kangur” would set this team on the position of a favorite to win the group D and guarantee the participation in a likely quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Walia for the 14th time during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be shinely sent back to the start with England within one eighth final.
"Let's make the case clear, both teams want to try to go through it and be head of the group," said the Wales fighter Tipuric.
In the past there were some hard results, but last autumn it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they'll be thirsty to take this victory from us, and we're going to want to take it again.
Before we arrived here, you knew this would be a big start.
And now we're here and it's really time to check out.
Walia won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or RPA in the history of the World Couchar – and it took 32 years ago in the third game when they defeated the "Kangurs".
And their total record under the lead of Coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to defeat three heavy teams of Southern Half.
Valia represented a string of 13 lost test games from Australia's hands in November last year, and Tipuric prepared to be among those few rescued from this win 9-6 who run to the Tokyo stadium on Sunday.
Tipuric, asked whether before this victory the team experienced a mental blockade, added: “It is hard to say.
These games are so balanced that maybe... people expect there's a mental blockage, I don't know.
The end of the last game, we probably left about 15 points on the field, so the final result seems much less advantage than it actually was.
If Wales triumph, then the struggle of Tipurica with the favorite Australian duo from the third mill line Michael Hooper and David Pocock during the detention and defeat will be essential.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in the colors of the representatives and met both players at a few earlier occasions, so he knows exactly what he's waiting for.
"They are the players playing at the seventh absolutely world class position," he said.
When the world class is played against the third mill line players, it is always known that it will be a difficult game to play.
Those two are always with the best players in the world.
You know what game you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably better feels footballs, because he's always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the best players in the world and to challenge yourself than to deal with the third line of milk, which is not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and by fighting these two, you must be in a top form.
I wouldn't say Sunday's final will almost happen, but it's an important game for us in this World Cup.
The impet is its essential element.
When we build strength and keep putting great efforts, we will fly like wings and we will be hard to be overcome.

It's a book prime minister.
"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Mlynarczyk
They were supposed to be an elite organization of the gentleman's race.
They accepted in their ranks those whom they despised.
Can the crime be connected stronger than the national identity?
In your hands, we give not another book about war or military theme.
We conduct a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in Waffen-SS.
Historians from different countries of Europe analyze the attitude and motivation of volunteers, remind their activities and look at the recruitment processes at each stage of war.
Did the Danish branches differ from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why didn't you create a branch of the Polish itself?
What is the official historical talk about collaboration in individual European countries today?
What happened to volunteers after the war ended?
Among other things, the book “Waffen-SS” is answered on the basis of solid research material.
We have also been trying to present a more subtle and more equitable, closer to the picture of collaboration in Europe during the second World War, trying to break the methodological borders of history and the period of history through the presentation of researchers' trials from different countries.... As far as the main victims of this war -- forced workers, Jews, prisoners, Nazi opponents, Germans, Slovenian people are sometimes presented in a comparable and/or extranational perspective, as many perpetrators are examined essentially from national perspectives (if so).
"A total panic" when the White House fights with the finding of arguments on impeachment
The officials from the White House will find out how to resist the pressures renewed on the impeachment Thursday, and one of the speakers familiar with the situation describes the feeling of “a total panic” that is sensitive last week due to the lack of response to the new reality plan.
It seems that it promotes “concerns, insecurity and concerns” — one of the people associated with the White House, thus describes the mood in the west wing – that the accusations of the informant can seriously harm the president and the people of his surrounding environment.
The person said: “There is no sure anything is hidden there. ”
The White House officials were still uncertain about how to proceed, not only because there is no obvious action plan in this situation, but also because the charges are so serious that the standard methods of effectively avoiding the controversy used by the President in the past may not work.
Another aware of the debate described the atmosphere in the White House as a “state of shock ” accompanied by a growing uncertainty that, together with a cross-controlled investigation on impeachment, the probability of the president to respond in an unresponsive way and become “easy to control”.
This fear is divided by another speaker who claims that the president's surroundings predicts that he will show more “reasonable” behaviour, and the pressure incurred on it will certainly begin to rise with every day of investigation on impeachment.
This causes anxiety that Trump can present an increasingly unpredictable behaviour and in an unexpected way to explode – it is in the context of the election year concern both in terms of the Presidentship and the elections.
By facing the biggest danger in the president, Trump circled from attack to defense, once again pursuing a strategy that he assessed as effective during the investigation of Robert Mueller on Russia.
He was trying to examine his own request to the Ukrainian President to assist in the investigation of his political rivals in order to distract and address it to the democrats and candidate of the democrats of Joe Biden and discredit the informant as a party incentive.
But while many people in the White House have been fighting after Mueller's investigation, this time something has changed -- advisors and consultants said.
The President, whose recognition mark is force, the median press conference has shown to be defeated – one of the persons familiar with the situation.
While Trump enthusiasticly accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed unwilling to answer questions about Ukraine, they said.
Some of the president's allies believe that the damage can be avoided, and some of them are aware of the fact that the informant had no knowledge from the first hand about the controversial telecommunication between President Trump and the Ukrainian President of Zielensk, which, according to them, contradicts his reliability.
And how often it happens when the president is the object of attacks, this fact is vividly raised by his main advocates in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategies linked to the White House indicates that the results of the president's support surveys are independently high, and the impeachment will not have much to affect new sympathetics.
“There is no positive need to concentrate on the impeachment of the President in the next four months”, especially if it has a problem with his legislative programme and is prevailing in the new cycle of headlines.
Another speaker claims that those who claimed that the impeachment would help the president did not fully understand how unpredictable his response would be.
The concerned White House officials were looking for help from advisors, compiling a team of response to impeachment.
According to the person who is aware of the plans, given that these efforts are in early stages, it remains clear whether any initiative in the way of the command centre will be taken and which form can be taken.
This person has stated that it is convincing that a co-ordinated legal and communication strategy is required with a decisive leader who is capable of carrying out an attack on the PR as a ripost to publish a violent signalist report and aimed at preventing the dissemination of the democratic actions of impeachment given by this report.
The speaker familiar with the situation claims that the lack of long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin stated that they did not intend to disclose a note of the Trump talk with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later, it was possible to feel that there was no exit and that the document was to be published.
The pressure is now predicted to be greater than during the investigation of Robert Mueller, who mostly kept silence and spoke only through accusations. One of those who can be involved in the development of reply to impeachment is Corey Lewandowski, a man of the dirty work of Trump and former head of the electoral staff, said a person associated with the case.
However, Lewandowski said in a conversation with NBC News that it is not true to suggest that he will manage this action.
"In the past five years, I have done everything I could to support the President and his programme," he said, "but I have not participated in any conversations with the President or his team to join the team to resist a false talk about impeachment."
The private attorney Donald Trump from the investigation of Mueller, Jay Sekulow, is also involved in impeachment.
“We respond to the matters we have right” – Sekulow replied when he was asked by NBC News to comment.
At present, the White House feels the lack of a lawyer experienced in the field of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked at the impeachment of Clinton and advised the White House at the end of the investigation of Mueller, left, and the present advisor, Pat Cipollon, has no experience of this type.
The Talker, familiar with the White House Strategy, said that officials generally did not plan to involve people at any time or create a command centre, but admitted that the need for a coordinated, common response and a person who could lead a political fight.
Explorer of the Seas line Royal Caribbean has passed a renovation for 89 million pounds
Explorer of the Seas, belonging to the Royal Caribbean International, will travel this summer to the sail, presenting a completely new appearance.
After renewing an impressive $110 million (89 million pounds), the ship admires the wide selection of culinary tastes from all over the world and the rich offer of fun for the whole family.
This summer, the Explorer will stay in the most excellent ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel the taste of the Mediterranean Europe.
When the land adventure ends, the ship's crew promises the unforgettable impacts on the sea.
With an offer satisfying everyone, the Explorer, after renovating $110 million, or some 89 million pounds, has entered a passenger ship with a perfect family entertainment.
An impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board through advanced surf simulators or see the favorite family film using weather charms within the plenary movie.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is to add virtual balconies that allow passengers to admire ocean views without the need to board.
Water lovers will be admired by the newly designed board at the pool connecting the Caribbean curor with the spells of the Water Park.

Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats of demanding "naked pictures of Trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes from the state of California apparently cannot bear the naked truth that President Donald Trump is being investigated.
On his Thursday defense, he accused the Democrats of getting the president's naked photos.
Nunes, a highly-represented Republican in the Commission for Intelligence of the Representation Chamber, filed the above charge during the preliminary statement during the hearing of the signalist's complaint, as if Trump had requested Ukraine to assist in the initiation of an investigation against the Democrat candidate on President Joe Biden and his son.
The Congressman called the Ukrainian scandal "grotesk show" of the left and their "media ace" before he found that the Democrats wanted to see the president's pictures in the negligible.
"The Democrats in this committee have negotiated with people who according to them were Ukrainians to receive Trump's naked photos," Nunes said.
"People may correctly ask why the Democrats are so determined to put the president in the state of charge when they have their chances in the next year.
When Nunes finished giving reprymends, the HuffPost political reporter, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats were really trying to find it.
Until now only the representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, responded, although we suspect that his answer was naked, as a confirmation of the thoughts of many of his colleagues and friends.
The portal Mediaite.com suspects that Nunes' comments on naked were referring to “some more favourable and unconfirmed information” that are likely to appear in Steele's controversial records,
This is a famous, gathered by the former British spy Christopher Steele's collection of charges against Trump, pointing to the probability of the existence of a tape, which is reportedly showing it by the watching the urine of a prostitute in the hotel room in Moscow.
Potential renewable biofuel studies can help reduce emissions
While electrical vehicles and Semi Tesli have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be excluding renewable energy — aircraft.
However, the Professor from Alberta University has developed technology that allows the renewable biofuels to be used as air fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at Albert's University of Agriculture, Life Sciences and Environment that started working on this project in 2003.
Its lab processes carbon fuels obtained from fat wastes such as fat from restaurants, fat animal origin and repack oil.
In contrast to ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use less quality oils during production, thus assessing 85% lower carbon emissions than for petroleum fuels, as well as waste from other sectors.
This technology is intended to imitate carbon dioxide present in oil fuels.
"What our technology has done in the first generation," said Bressler – is [in fact] carbohydrates, which are the same particles as in diesel fuel."
While opening this new possibility of biofuel use, the previously developed biofuel products had a tendency to destabilise at lower temperatures, which was a serious threat in the case of aircraft flying at high heights.
“The problem with air fuel is a little wrong circle”, said Bressler.
It's really worth less than the diesel, but it has higher requirements.
Bressler's lab is currently looking at two air fuel production options.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional processing of carbon dioxide and adding hydrogen.
The second option is to continue to work on partially developed chemical properties that will ensure fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," said Bressler, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The opening company created by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working on the commercialisation of the product, because airlines, as well as the Canadian and American Army, increase investments in the renewable option.
"They are able to imagine the times when the situation may be reversed and the carbon tax will be put on them," he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will form an emergency plan.
Forge is currently running a pilot facility near the Edmonton Waste Management Centre and has recently received the amount of $4 million from Lockheed Martin in the context of the investment to support the cost of $25 million of the construction of the production facility, which will be located in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce about 19 million litres of biofuel a year.
Bressler also notes that the carbon reduction established will amount to about 85 per cent, but issues such as transport and fuel production stop the further reduction of carbon.
"As a technology specialist," Bressler said,
I have a task to develop options that allow conscious decisions and many choices."
MOST: Another grandchildren's fraud
8,000 euros and 750 euros lost the apartment of Zamstia, thinking that he was helping his grandson who caused an accident.
The police were informed on Thursday by the son of a fraud.
"The woman called on Wednesday a man who claimed to be her grandson.
He told me he caused an accident and he needs money.
Otherwise he's going to go to jail.
The senior in order to help her grandson passed 8 thousand zles and 750 euros to the false policeman who came to her house," says Assistant Dorota Krukowska-Bubilo from the Military Police.
The police are looking for the perpetrators and again call for caution:
“Each phone with a request for financial assistance must be verified.
It should not be affected by emotion and in a hurry.
Let's remember that the cops don't ask for money and don't take money.
If we get a phone with a request for financial support that will raise our suspicions, we should respond immediately and notify the police by calling the 112 alarm number.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about threats, let's tell us how the fraud works.
Let us ask for caution and not to trust those who call and ask for loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's allies warn that, in the event of the removal of the Britain Brexit, they are threatening to threaten such as Los Angeles, and he himself appeals to peace.
One of the chief ministers of the office said last night that the country was threatened by a “violent social breakdown” if the original result was questioned by the second referendum.
Prime Ministers of Great Britain from his nearest surroundings warned that the countries threatened social concerns to the scale of the “yellow vests” protests in France because of social inequalities and residues in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for “concerning moods” during a riot arguing about the language of politics, but emphasized that it would not stop using the word“ betraying. ”
Despite his calling for peace, the cabinet minister said "The Times," "the country never had such protests as the "gilets jaunes" demonstrations, or residentialities in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think that's impossible, just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – gilets jaunes – they use encrypted phones to coordinate the pickets, and to push people to protest is enough for several unwanted populistic leaders.
The inhabitants in Los Angeles exploded after the jury's jury liberated four white cops who beat a black taxizer Rodney King in 1992.
This year, anti-governmental demonstrators in France wearing yellow refreshing vests – jaunes gylet – have been desolate for over six weeks and devastate Paris streets.
The Minister responded to the warning of Johnson in the Gmin Chamber and said that if Britain fails to get out of the EU, there will be a "Castrophical loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we organize a referendum that votes in 30 million people and 66% of them will come behind the remaining of UK in the European Union, the ten million citizens will remain unsatisfied," the Minister said.
Even if such a result ignores 99% of them, we will have 100,000 angry people who will write to their messenger and who will not let go.
Many don't need to see a few thousand people on the street soon.
One of the principal ministers of the office added that the country is threatened by a “violent social breakdown” if the result of the first referendum is questioned by the second.
Johnson called to organize general elections in which the voters would decide on the fate of brexite.
According to the reports, the Prime Minister is facing the risk of the rebellion of the office to reduce demands for brexite and to achieve a compromise agreement with the EU.

Follow us Talk'N'Roll
More than 300 participants listened on Thursday (September 26) 11 inspiring statements of prelegents, including Simon Hollownia, Chubovna, or Ireneus Krosny.
It's all in the Talk'N'Roll conference that's been held in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Enlargement of the horizons, talks about the ideas worth audience and common discussions that can become a impulse to further development.
This is the goal of organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 special prelegents, representing very different sectors and areas of interest, including people famous for the media - Simeon Holiday, Cristina Cross and Ireneus.
The key to this year's Talk'N'Roll editing was "Crafting the future, NOW" and about the creation of the future, the guests invited to participate in the conference were focused.
The first session was opened by the director of Sabre Poland, Sebastian Djevecki, who told us how the mark that is built around us may affect our future.
Richard Lucas went to the scene to change the perception of the public on the phenomenon of rejection, claiming that it should be accepted, if he wanted to create a future, Chris Badura took the subject of empathy in the age of bright development of technology.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared observations and techniques that could help to manage career and increase the overall satisfaction by finding a proper balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multiangular conversation with Cristina Cheerful, which, inter alia, told us how the profession of a teacher in Poland changed from its perspective for the space of years.
The owner of one of the most popular votes in the country admitted that, thanks to technology development, everyone can now be difficult to do this.
However, he does not think that, in the coming years, a lecturer’s position is fully replaced by technology.
Right after it, Peter Nabelec took the problem of life during the time of information, emotional, or overcome on the matter of choice, giving public valuable instructions, how to deal with it, and Luke Latocha in his speech spoke about what could lead to another industrial revolution known as "Revenue 4.0".
Enjoying Learn, Teaching Fun
The conference organizers also took care of artistic impressions, inviting the illusionist, Daniel Oneak.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneus Krosny, who first played the pantonym publicity, and then, on a example of his own career, told him how he was trying to maintain the right balance between his career in the scene and his private life.
He also abducted the participants by Simon Hollownia, highlighting the role of time in our lives.
The publicist noted that even two minutes can diameterally change the situation and have to be ready to use that time.
Furthermore, the Holandia shared its thoughts about the reality that surrounded us, calling for anecdotes that could have caused a smile on the faces of the viewers.
Then the scene appeared on Adrian Creatorka, who reviewed the history and objectives of several innovative models and linked them to how they are currently used.
At the end of Marcin Slovak, on the Rubik cube, he told us about the approach to address the problems.
Each of the 11 prelegents certainly brought something new in seeing the reality of all who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and natural responses and many questions to guests show great involvement by the public.
The organizers have provided a transmission for all who have not been able to participate in the event personally, and the tapes from the lectures are available on the website.
Governments of law instead of the governments of law.
“Despite the lack of sufficient number of votes to amend the Constitution, the governing majority has introduced a number of changes in the State system, creating threats to the protection of law and the rule of the three division of power”, states the Helsinese Human Rights Fund published on Thursday.
The report “The governments of law instead of the governments of law” documents, inter alia, changes in justice and the protection of fundamental rights and freedom.
The Helsinese Human Rights Foundation (HFPC) published on Thursday a report entitled “Rules of Law instead of the governments of law.
Threats for the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015-2019."
The Fund estimates that the largest regression in the protection of human rights in Poland has been recorded in 2015-2019 after 1989.
“Despite the lack of sufficient number of votes to amend the Constitution, the governing majority has introduced a number of changes in the State system, creating threats to the protection of law and the rule of the three division of the authorities.
By adapting the right to political goals, the governments have been replaced by the laws of law," the HFPC experts wrote.
What's in the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as public media or Civil Rights Officer) and in the field of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including the freedom of assembly, women's rights, the rights of persons of LGBT and the right to a genuine process).
The report also summarizes the quarrel between the Polish authorities and the European Union for the past three years.
"In the last four years, for the first time and to that extent, we have observed the use of the right to implement participating parties' interests.
This was based on the ongoing crisis of law, as well as on the weakening of the entire human rights system in Poland," said Marcin Free, attorney, one of the reporters.
Protection of Human Rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years are “the period of systemic changes both in the country” and“in the protection of human rights”.
In the last four years, Seim has adopted more than 20 key acts in terms of human rights protection.
“The amendments were often taken in a hurry, without social consultations and despite the observations of the legal environment, the Civil Rights Officer or international organizations”, translated by the lawyer of Malgorzat Schuleka, a co-autor of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years are: “It is weakening independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), disrespecting the binding judgments of courts and recommendations of international institutions and weakening the guarantee of protection of human rights”.
State authorities have not responded
In particular, the Helsinese Human Affairs Foundation recognized “the situations in which state authorities have not responded or simply ignored the occurring cases of aggression”.
Foundation experts noted that some changes were made in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups in danger of discrimination.
The Foundation indicates that the State's activity in the area of restriction of law is the ongoing dispute of Polish authorities with the European Union, as well as a series of recommendations by international law actors.
"No implementation of these recommendations only weakens the position of Poland as a democratic leader of changes in the Central-East Europe region, but also threatens the Polish State to be responsible for the violation of the law of the European Union or the European Convention of Human Rights," the report reads.
Brother of Pakistan's social media stars with life for honourable murder
Women's law experts argue that investigation of justice is often difficult because of the prolonged proceedings, the release of suspected killers on bail and the detention of awareness of public opinion.
"It takes so long that people forget," says Farzana Bari, the defenders of women's rights and the first founder in Pakistan of the gender department at the university, and adds that even a broadly reported case of Baloch murder has been resolved for over three years.
Although, according to the groups fighting for women's rights, reliable data are difficult to determine, the Pakistanian Commission for Human Rights in 2018 found at least 300 cases of honourable murders.
Many activists claim that the real number is much higher, and a network that promotes awareness of crimes from honourable motives estimates that in Pakistan there is about one fifth of the 5000 honour killings committed every year throughout the world.
Recorded Polish earnings abroad
However, transmissions to the country are declined, because many emigrants are sitting outside Poland permanently, the Friday Rechpospolita says.
The latest Euro-Tax report indicates that the average profits of the Polaci workers in other countries of Europe amounted to more than 8.6 thousand evils in 2018, which means that they grew by almost a thousand gold, which is almost 12%.
Euro-Tax “asses that the total income of Polish emigrant emigrants in the Union has reached a record value of 154,5 billion of zles in 2018, one seven more than a year earlier”, we read.
Director of the Centre for Research on the Migrations of Warsaw University, Paul Kačmarczyk says the Poles are getting better at the international labour market where they use various options available.
"The number of experts and experts also grows, who are moving from the country to the country, like international corporate employees," the newspaper reports.
Part of Euro-Tax clients work in two countries over the year, such as UK and Germany.
“It is the most in the RFN in 2018, because by 11%, the total profits of Polish emigrants (to approximately 27 billion zles) increased.
However, the Polish has earned most of them in the islands – nearly 35 billion of evils," we read on.
The President of Euro-Taxu believes that despite improving the working conditions on the Polish market, the number of emigrant emigrants is not smaller.
Because the saxes in the West and Northern Europe (on the lead of Norway) are often the chance of several times higher than in Poland.
“And even at the minimum rates in the country, e.g. which are 9.5 to 11.7 euros per hour,” the Journal informs.
“Réčpospolita” states that the Poles remain not only because of higher earnings, but also because they have accommodated abroad.
Many of the Polyamerians are leaving the roots abroad, as is seen after the smaller transfers of money to the country.
Those last year were the lowest for years.
As the Economist Recalls, with the prolongation of the time of stay abroad, a small group of people transferring money to the country is reduced and their height is reduced.
“Emigrants are drawing their loved ones to each other, ” we read in Friday’s Recpospolite.
The prolonged monsunes cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extended for almost a month, and the unexpected rainfall causes death as a result of the displacement of buildings and the gnoying of many fruits.
Usually, in northern India, monsun declines at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month exceeded 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the latest ending monsun for decades.
In many areas of the country, rain rainfall is still unseen – recently in the West of India, Pune Central and Thursday rain rain has led to several people to death and destruction in the result of the crash of buildings.
The houses were flooded, people scattered through the streets in the water of their knees, which normally happens only during the monsune apogeum.
Many rainfall also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.
Because of long-term rain in Uttarakhand, many homes have been destroyed.
Monsun also started delaying.
In many areas there was no water, so farmers were preparing for the likely dry.
The long-term monsun is not welcomed by farmers.
The amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year.
"With him, my vegetables – and now I have a bovine, grapes and tomatoes – will rot," said Prakash Mehr, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of the delayed and late ending monsune means an increase in the price of a nawel, which is the necessary ingredient of Indian food.
The portfolio, for which it usually had to be paid 20 rupias (0.23 pounds) is currently costing 80 rupies (about 1 pound) for a kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Bombai.
The festivals and Christmas are also in danger.
Another big festival is the 8 October Dasara celebration, during which the Indians raise huge dolls like from the comic books, representing Ravana, a form of muscle and a vicious smile from the Romanian epos.
The smoking of Ravana symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that Ravana's similarity was made from paper, if monsun continues, Ravana will be laughing last.

Doodle celebrates the 21st birthday of Google
It would be hard to imagine the world today without Google.
In the search engine, we're looking for answers to all the troubled questions.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is this?", "Where?", "How?" and "How?" is one of the favorite categories that the Poles are searching for.
The giant data indicates that last year we were willing to ask about the "Where is the storm?", "How do you make spargs?" and "How many fingers have a horse?", "How can we get rid of the fruit mush?", "How to eat some kind?"
Today, the search engine cares about the first twenty-first birthday.
Her users – and in Poland up to 96 percent of people are using “Uncle Google” – welcome a special Google Doodle today.
He's not animated this time.
Google reminds of his birthday, showing a steady computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the right, bottom corner, a digital date was printed – as in the picture of the 1990s.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
The search engine was set up for a specific purpose – it was intended to catalog all possible information and to make it available through the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from a mathematical term of googol that means the number of ten raised to the 100 power.
This name was also to reflect the intentions of the company to index as much as possible of the world's internet resources.
The Google searcher was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 in their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the dependency between the parties that worked better than the normal segregation of results based on the frequency of the phrase.
In the beginning, the search engine had the name BlackRub, which refers to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linking to the result.
Page and Brin founded a company operating under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon later they launched the famous Google.com page today.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, in the PC Magazine, there is information about the extremely valuable Google search results.
Then the story of the company looks almost like a fairy tale - lightning development with each month, conquering more markets and increasing the company's value.
In June 2000, Google's URL index has over a billion positions, which makes the Page and Brina work acquire the name of the largest Internet search engine in the world.
Currently, the company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading IT players.
Is there any other field for development?
"The Google mission is to organize global information resources to be commonly available and useful, although we have made great progress in this area, it is still a long way to achieve this goal," Peter Zalewski from Google Polsk provided in a conversation with the Newsweek.
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and brain attack
A new study suggests that the work with an exposure to contact with plant protection measures at large levels may be a high risk of heart disease in later years of life.
This happened in the Japanese group of Americans in Hawaii, who have been studied for over 30 years.
Scientists found that in comparison with men who did not work with plant protection measures, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more at risk of heart disease or heart attack.
“The study emphasizes the need for personal protection equipment to be used during contact with pesticides at work and the importance of recording in medical contact with such measures in work, as well as the control of standard factors to increase the incidence of heart diseases”, said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez, co-autor.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in the district of Manoa.
The results are based on data on more than 6000 men on Oahu Island, who participated in the cardiological program Kuakini Honolulu.
According to scientists, research results may not apply to women and other populations, as it concerns only Japanese men.
Pesticides have a long time of half-decline, so the effects of their health effects can be known for years after contacting these substances.
In this case, the most visible results have been observed within 10 years of contact with plant protection substances.
“ After 34 years of men’s observation, ” stated Rodriguez in the press, “the relationship between the exposure to pesticides and heart diseases and the heart attack was no longer significant. ”
It was likely because more important factors in the ageing that masked possible cause-effective relations between the exposure to pesticides and the incidence of the diseases of the circulation system in later years of life.
Students have not discovered a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate quantities of plant protection and an increase in the risk of heart disease or infarction.
Telephone call Zelenski-Trump: Poszenko gives his three cash
Washington's policy has a violent week in connection with the initiation of an immediate procedure against US President Donald Trump
The political scandal is for the political debiutant Volodymire of the Zelene situation that he would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about Zelensky-Tropmp's affair and will she have long-term effects for the first of them?
Almost at the introduction of the telephone call, Trump announced to Zelenski that the United States have done more for Ukraine than for European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes note revealed by the White House are not full, they detailed the Trump attack on the Officer Germany Angela Merkel for the fact that the German leader and other leaders of the European countries are engaged in negotiations instead of presenting specific proposals.
The controversy raised the Zelensky answer that said that it agreed with Trump not in 100%, but in 1000%.
Zelenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are trying to help Ukraine in an insufficient manner.
This exchange of opinions led to the policymakers, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, to decide to vote through social services.
Petro Poroszenko, former President of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the EU's support was "without precedens".
In other tweets, Poszenko said he was grateful for the support of the EU's "Russian aggression" which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including the Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytsitska, said: “How can we talk to the Germans and France now? ”
Trump then mentioned military assistance and asked Zlenesky to investigate not in one and two cases: the first of the son of Joe Biden – Hunter – and the second relating to the invasion of DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacker attack on the e-mail boxs of Democrats during the elections in 2016.
It is not known whether this will corrupt European relations or will make relations with the leader of France and Germany be broken.
I don't want to talk wrong about anyone...
We thank all those who are helping us," he announced after the publication of a telephone call from Zelenski in New York during the United Nations General Assembly.
Zelenski is to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the nearing “four Normandish” summit, which is to take place in October.
The military inspector has been authorised to dismiss
The court cleared Jeremy Wisnewski from his deeds.
After six years, Wisnewski was finally cleared from the charges.
The Industrial Court cleared the former Head of the Military Inspector of Quality Trade Articles of Agriculture and Food in Rheshowa, from the charge of the overlap of powers.
The Lovel Prosecutor claimed that he was to betray the marshal of the warehouse in the warehouse of food oil.
Recently, the jurisdiction of the dismissal has fallen in this case.
The appeal was recognized on September 12th.
“The Court has maintained a convicted judgment in force”, confirms Judge Malgorzata Reizer, the Prosecutor of the District Court in the Industry.
It is a sentence of February 14, issued by the Regional Court of Justice in the Industries.
Jeri Wisnewski then commented on him on Facebook: “It has passed six years since I was presented by the Appeal Prosecution Prosecutor in Lublina with the apparent violation of the law in the telephone conversation with the Marshal of the Podcarpacki military leadership on 30 April 2012.
The Court clearly stated that I was innocent and did not break the existing law at that time.
I was convinced that my phone call was in line with the Marshal of Podcarpacki military leadership.
The version of the events published by the media identified in 2013 by the Appeal Prosecutor in Lublina was true and caused unreverse damage to both the food producer and the loss of the image of my person in my employers, among my employees and in the local community.
The act of accusation made to me in the Court's opinion contained a series of mistakes, false facts, irregular legal definitions, which are not actually confirmed.
With the help of CBA in Rhesha, I was being eliminated from public and professional life.
Then I was immediately dismissed of work and deprived of funds.
I've been staying for a long time to keep my wife."
Let's remind you.
The Wisnewski function of the military quality trading inspector of agricultural and foodstuffs was carried out in the period 2009-2013.
He was revoked from his position after the prosecution in Lublina filed charges in 2013.
According to investigators, he had in a telephone conversation to betray the former marshal of the military leadership (Miroslav Karapita was sentenced to four years of liberation) the time of control in the establishment of a food oil that belonged to the wife of the then subcarpacian vice-Marshal.
This warning – as the prosecutors of Lublina claimed – was to cause the company's owner to know about control and adjust the labels on oils that were incomplete.
Jerze Wisnewski heard the charges of overcoming his powers, which threatened him to be liberated for three years.
"I feel relief that this matter has finally ended and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I had done nothing wrong, which is now the final confirmation of the rightful sentence to liberate me from my charges," comments Jerzy Wisnewski.
The White House was trying to hide a conversation with Zielensky.
On Thursday, the newly edited report of the signalist wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking to the President of Ukraine Volodymer Zelensky, was looking for an alien country's involvement in the elections in the United States, and the White House was trying to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report dated on August 12th, a signalist who is likely an interviewer, he wrote: “In the framework of my official duties, I was informed by many members of the US government that the president used his function to seek an alien country's involvement in the elections in 2020 in the United States.”
“Trump has used a part of the conversation with Zielensk to implement its own interests.
And exactly – he tried to press the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the president in the reelection in 2020," says the report quoted by the The Hill Journal.
The Ukrainian leader has been given to understand that contacts with Trump are dependent on whether “the will of taking the game” in cases that the lawyer of President Rudy Giuliani would inform him more accurately.
The author admits that he was not a witness of the conversation, but stresses that he was briefed about its content by “a number of officials of the White House who had direct information on this subject ” and their relationships covered.
"In the next days of this conversation, I have learned from many American officials that high-range representatives of the White House intervened to "zaplomble" all the archive records on this conversation, and in particular the literal record that has been made, as it is usually done, in the White House's crisis peace," we read further.
"A high rank, White House officials told me that the White House's lawyers "instructed them" to remove the electronic record from the information system where such records are stored.
The record was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate information particularly confidential,” wrote the author of the report.
"In my assessment, these steps indicate that the White House officials were aware of the weight of what happened during the conversation," the signalist estimated.
As the AP comments, this document will probably accelerate the procedure on the possibility of the President's impeachment, and it also contains valuable information on witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
The record of the conversation with the Zielen White House, after the pressures of the Congress, made available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of the electronic record, but on the basis of the relationship of those who were witnesses to it.
The content of the report, in the edited version, revealed a day later by the Commission of the Representation Chamber.
Also on Thursday, the director of the American Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testified before the committee of the Representation Chamber and provided explanations on the way he treated the report of the interviewer.
Maguire said that the signalist made the right choice and did what the law orders.
He also emphasized that his view of conversation with Zelensk was the event “without precedens. ”
The Democrats in the Intelligence Commission asked Maguire why he blocked the delivery to the Congress of the Signalist Report; the director of the Intelligence said that he had no power to disclose his content, which the confidential nature guarantees the so-called executive privilege.
Part of Maguire's interrogation by the committee took place behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the President of the Representation Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, informed that, in the light of the suspicion that the President had pressure on Ukraine's authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential elections, the Representation Chamber conducted an investigation that could lead to Trump's impeachment.
A day later, she assessed that Trump's conversation with Zielensk confirms that the President of the United States has broken the standards for elections and security.
The electoral law in the United States prohibits the use of foreign aid.
The resort of justice, however, estimated that the president had not broken the election law. On Thursday, the White House Proclaimer Stephanie Grisham said that there was no "nothing wrong" in the conversation, and the report "none more than a collection of third-hand relations and clayed press clusters."
"The White House will continue to criticize this media hysteria and false narration promoted by the media of the main nurt," she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO prizes
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th period of the International Organisation of Civil Aviation (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The security prize has been granted in proof of the recognition that Ghana has obtained the highest number of air safety points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 per cent of the temporary Implementation rate (EI).
It occurred when the ICAO completed its ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the General Audit Programme for the Aviation Control of the UN Aviation Agency.
The security prize was a proof of the recognition of the country's high involvement in the implementation of the ICAO standards and protocols for the protection of airports and Ghana airspace.
The Award Programme was developed to provide support for the ICAO initiative No Country Left Behind.
Furthermore, the ICAO Member States which improved their safety and protection standards have granted 16 other safety certificates and 17 in the field of protection.

He stated "was important that we keep reminding ourselves that even in the innovation of the security of safety and sustainable development must remain our primary priorities".
Mr. Adda, on his own, observed that the awards were a huge achievement for the State's efforts, because they are a complement for hard work and the endurance of the industry.
He also added that the aviation industry has a huge potential for the development of the country's economy, saying “aviation has powerful opportunities to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but everything comes from security and protection that we have achieved."

Trump nominates Peter Gaynor for head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, who serves as a federal administrator of the Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles when testifys at the meeting of the Senatic Budgetary Sub-Commission on National Security on the proposal for the FEMA for the financial year 2020 at the Capital Hill in Washington, USA, on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that the US President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as Head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA) on Thursday.
Gaynor, who is the Deputy Administrator of FEMA, shall be the head of the agency who supervises the government's response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency has acted without the administrator approved by the American Senate since March, when Brock Long has dismissed this position.
Long resigned after the Department of National Security of the United States under the FEMA found that Long was incorrectly used by government vehicles to travel between Washington and its home in Northern Caroline.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month, when the exact examination of his past revealed the charge that he was involved in a fight in the bar.
Gaynor's nomination was expected for this position.
To approve his nomination for this role, most of the Senate will be required.
The White House notified that before Gaynor became a Deputy Administrator of FEMA in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in marine marine.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, considers the amputation of his finger
The 28-year-old runner specialized on the distance of 1500 meters, acquiring a gold medal of European championships in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the vice-major of Europe at 5000 meters from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that it was not a new supplies and that he had already passed one operation immediately after the games in 2016, but the pains have come back and the current season have increased very much.
The pain makes me put my foot differently, which changes my body's system, other unnatural burdens, and I start to feel pain in other places, such as the beacon.
That's why I couldn't prepare myself enough for the world's championships, and for two weeks, the pain is so strong that I have difficulties with laying rings," said the runner on the NRK TV channel.
The father and coach of Guert Ingebrigtsen admitted that after long discussions with their son, they had concluded that the only solution was not to complete his career and to participate in the future Olympic games in Tokyo.
It seems that it's the only one, although a drastical solution and a decision has actually fallen.
“If a part of the body hurts, it should be removed, and, in general, Henrik does not need this finger so much, and in that situation, it should be forgotten of a cosmetic asspection," he explained.
The police close the illegal plant of e-papers with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday the police closed an illegal e-paper factory with marihuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
On the office building standing at 9600 Telstar Avenue, about 16:37 was launched, while the police were searching for illegal e-papers for sale of marihuana and during which large glass containing butan hassis oil were found – concentrate from Indian cannades.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano from El Monte police, officers also found a device used to complement vaccination contributions.
“This process is very dangerous”, says Cano.
Cano, who used to work with drugs, says that distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially easy process.
“Ordinary electrostatic spark from our clothes can cause the burning of these ovens, causing not only fire but because of concentration, even explosion” he says.
“If we have a lot of slays in the room and similar, after one explosion, another will occur, causing not only fire, but also an explosion, which could dissolve the entire complex from the surface.
The office was called on a special task team to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
The value of confiscated products and equipment is currently not known.
Detectives say they've received an anonymous instruction that lets them get a search warrant, which has detected illegal activity.
The investigators are still trying to get information about who's behind this illegal business.
They say that a responsible person has established a business in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation continues and officers want to be sure that illegal products have not arrived on the street, taking into account recent articles on vaccination harm.
"The people really don't know what products they buy," Cano says.
“They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may be a threat to our community and our children, so we always keep them from reaching this kind of thing.
Aphtin withdrawn from the market.
GIF has made a decision on the medicinal product on the spleens.
The main Pharmaceutical Inspector has informed the withdrawal of oral infections from the market.
Aphtin is a medicinal product used to treat blisters and infections of the lipstick membrane infection, infections with gram-additional bacteria.
It can also be used as auxiliary to treat the infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginos.
The product was withdrawn due to incompatibility with the requirements of quality specification of the product smell and the decline in the active substance content.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galen Laboratory in Olstin.
Each month GIF shall make an average number of decisions on the withdrawal of a single series of products from the market.
A series of medicines stopped in the traffic in Poland can be reinstated once evidence is presented to the safety of its use.
There is no such possibility if you withdraw your medicine.
Banknot 19 zl – where to buy a collective banknote about this nominal?
He has a nominal of 19 gold, and there is a picture of Ignacego Paderewski.
At the beginning of October, a new collectioner banknot will be circulated – the National Bank of Poland informed.
This is another banknote from the "Independence" series.
It is to remember the 100th year of the formation of the Polish Making of Securities Papers.
According to the NBP communication, Ignaci Jan Paderewski will be presented on the banknote.
The date placed on the banknote, 25 January 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the rise of the PWWP.
Also, the nominal value, 19 evils, refers to the year of creation of the Creator" - we read in the NBP communication.
The water mark presents an image of an eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in the PWPW after the recovery of independence.
The news is a holographic belt located on the window in the floor.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignacega Paderewski, and next to the inscription “independent” is the style of the Orle's order.
This letter, reflected in Joseph Pilsudski's manuscript, is a logotype of the 100-year renewal by Poland of independence.
In a branch of vaurin, symbolising brotherhood and victory, the security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angle effect.
On the reverse page of the banknote, the image of the Creative Factory is placed on the background of modern Warsaw panorama.
Besides, it is built in the PWPW logo protecting SPARK Live and the burning belt, also visible in the UV light in the form of repeating numbers "19" and "NBP" - describes NBP.
The banknot is to enter the circuit on October 2nd, up to 55,000 pieces.
One banknote will cost 80 gold.
All coins and banknotes issued by NBP, including those from special series, are a legal payment in Poland.
However, their nominal value is significantly higher than the one that can be achieved in the collection market.
The new owner bought it for $50,000, which is over two million of gold, for his parents, and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to the Easton port where it was loaded on the bar.
He's swimming 50 miles from there.
Jaroslav Kaczynski votes for the Malgorzata of Gossiew
The President of the PS Jaroslav Kaczynski will vote at the coming elections on the Gossiewska Malgorzata.
“Please, ” he urged.
Jaroslav Kaczynski and Mr. Gossiewska were posted to the picture of the baner candidate of PIS.
On Friday, the warsaw “three” commended in the social media that it gained the Kaczynski voice in parliamentary elections.
"The President of the Law and Justice, Prime Minister Jaroslav Kaczynski, supports the Gossiewska Malgorzata," we read on its Facebook profile.
The chairman of the party noted that he is a sensitive, emotional person and is always willing to provide help.
"I will give my voice to the Gossiew Małgorzata, and I ask for the same," she appeals.
Gossiewska candidate to Seim of District 19 (Warshawa) and from the third place in the list.
The "one" is the Caczynski, and the second is the Major of Kamin.
Here comes the Christmas Targs of Books.
We're ahead of meeting with popular writers and books at extraordinary prices.
"We are here to break stereotypes.
The inhabitants of Podcarpacia say they don't read books.
We will show that it's different," said Martha Halftorak during the press conference.
And who will support the reading in Rheshova this year?
As we heard, Sister Anastasia, the first cook of the things, and the Luke Orbitowski, Katherine Bonda, Karolina Corwin-Piotrowska, and Jacob Čuv, will appear on the markets.
This autumn in Millennium Hall will take place a great cultural event – 22 and 23 November to the trading center, 3th edition of the Christmas Book Targs, or one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishing and booking officers from all over Poland will come to the market.
They will be 30, and among them will be Agora, SQN, PWN, and Black.
At their posts, they will present their broad publishing offers and hundreds of book news that marketers can buy at attractive prices.
Furthermore, during two days of the market, there will be special meetings with writers.
This time, the authors were invited to write about important matters and not fear to deal with difficult subjects, and they are also prestigious awards and... they're great cooking.
The invitation author list is not closed yet.
At this point, the participation in the markets confirmed, namely, Lukas Orbitowski, the passport laureat, Janus Leon Wisnewski, the author of the bestseller's "Net Loneliness", and the Queen of the Polish Criminal: Katherine Bonda.
This year's sales star will be the sister Anastasia, author of several books (including cooks), which sold in more than 4 million copies.
Exhibition of the missing Elizabeth dress I in the Hampton Court Palace
The silver clothing made from the most famous silk camlot has been arrayed with a quaft representing vegetation, animals and butterflies.
For Eleri Lynn, the exhibitor of the Historic Royal Palaces Foundation, it meant only one thing.
A bleeding fabric hanging 100 years on the wall of the small rural parish church she was looking at, could only be a missing part of Elizabeth's clothing I.
Three years after Lynn encountered the exhibition of the altar clothing in Bacton in the county of Herefordshire, the missing Elizabeth dress was to hit the next month at the Hampton Court Palace, near the same rooms in which the Queen of Tudors could wear it more than 450 years ago.
The importance of this discovery is that the entire collection of royal dresses survived only another element of the XVIth century dress.
Although there is no unexpected evidence that Elizabeth was ever wearing this dress, three years of research have strengthened experts in conviction that she had to be part of the royal dress.
The silver, incredibly the road fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the Royal Court, and the virtuozer quality of the hafted plants and flowers, later enriched by deer, dogs, butterflies, fishers and bears, indicated that the clothing belonged to the most famous of the people.
The dress, when it was sewed, could cost the cost of the Tudor property.
“Ofree, in the 1990s, the end of Elizabeth's rule, she felt the threat of other women in the court and would not tolerate rivals carrying such artificial fabrics,” says Lynn.
"As this is a very important statement, I asked many people from the environment to look at their dresses.
I was really pleased to see the dress, and they also admired it and were practically convinced that we have the element of the royal dressing.
A long, re-life dress cut to serve as altar cloth in the dark church of St. Faith in Bacton is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is the settlement from which Blanche Parry came from, the nearest lady of the court to Elizabeth, who served the queen throughout her long life, and with which local legends were identified by the said fabric.
Although the dress came up after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to Parry's family or parish to Blanche's memory before her death in 1603.
After over a thousand hours of conservatory work, four hundred of whom went on a larger manual sewage with specially painted silk and thin surgery needles, the altar facing the exhibition next to the exhibition rented by the Hatfield House portrait “Rainbow Portrait”, one of the most famous pictures of the then presented by Elizabeth dressed in a similar dress.
“When working with historical cloths, it really starts to respect the crowd of people who have done it”, says Libby Thompson, the chief of the Conservatory Works, whose majority took place in the processed glass in the Hampton Court Palace, the only large place to place some of the valuable palace gobelins.
"When I looked at the front and back, I began to feel great respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on something so elite.
The "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" exhibit will begin on October 12th in the Hampton Court Palace
Fitch has confirmed Poland's rating with a stable perspective
Fitch confirmed the Polish long-term rating on the foreign currency at the "A-" level on Friday – in the communication.
The rating perspective remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency pointes to strong macroeconomic and well-diversified economic funds, which is supported by reasonably conducted economic policy and the strong banking sector," the Ministry of Finance reports.
According to Fitch, he noted that Poland was at the top of the combining cycle and in the 2019-2021 real growth rate of the Brutto National Product in Poland would be 4,1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent accordingly.
The Agency predicts that the deficit of the government and self-governmental sector to GDP in the years 2020-2021 will remain below 3 per cent, respectively 2.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent.
“The debt rate of the government and self-governmental sector to GDP will be 50.5 per cent in 2019 and will be less (average 48.3 per cent in the period 2020-2021), we read.
Rating of Polish
The autumn round of Polish rating reviews will end on 11 October S&P and Moody's.
The rating of Poland in Fitch's assessment remains the same as it was issued at the end of March 2019.
The Agency then confirmed the Polish rating at the A- level with a stable perspective.
Of the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland’s credit reliability estimates Moody's at A2 level.
Polish rating according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level below Moody's.
The perspectives of all evaluations are stable.
What's the rating?
The rating agencies shall develop to assist investors in assessing the risk of their investment activities.
The rating shall be granted to companies, banks and countries.
For these latest, each assessment is transferred to economic attractivity.
Rating is nothing but a credit reliability assessment.
On its basis, decisions are made to whom and how much money to borrow.
Sometimes such information also suggests who is best not giving any loans at all, because it is a risk that money will not be recovered.
The lower rating is associated with a higher risk.
In turn, higher risks are high interest rates.
Each assessment must be justified and awarded.
Assessment can be manipulated, but in that case the agencies risk losing their reputation.
At this point, over 90% of the world rating service market controls three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them uses its own assessment system.
“Fiveth of the Confederation: First 1,000 plus
The “Fiveth of the Confederation”, which is the main foundations of the electoral programme, presented the candidates to the Seim of District 40 on Friday in the list of KW Confederation Freedom and Independence.
The Leader of the Koshalian Letter to the Sejm Christof Chmilewski presented the password “Five of the Confederation”.
"The first program 1000 plus for Poland, secondly fast and fair courts, third cultural bon and educational bon, after fourth national security, for the fifth is a healthy life," said Chmilewski.
He noted that “Poles must finally begin to earn worthy,” so the Confederation wants to eliminate the income tax and, as Chmilewski said, “the problem with the free amount of tax itself will be resolved”.
"The Poles must be given a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, which is the zero PIT and the voluntary ZUS for all," said the leader of the letter on the foundations of the "program 1000 plus for Poland".
Instead, Alexandra Zadencka, starting from the second place of the letter, referring to the programming password “healthy life”, said that“ food is increasingly worse quality” and that should be “help for Polish farmers, Polish agriculture”, to act for free generations from GMO.
As she said, the Confederation also calls for the cessation of the “stagmatization of seed ropes. ”
Zadencka declared the support of the Confederation for “the development of the construction of natural raw materials”.
She also spoke on behalf of her grouping for “a voluntary vaccines. ”
"The right to conscious consent cannot be broken," she added.
Other candidates to the Seim from the Coshalian District emphasized that the Confederation is under the “depth reform of judiciary”, which should be the element of, inter alia, the consideration of the case by the judge "day after day".
They also agreed that the educational subsidy would enter schools without the intermediaries of the authorities, or, according to them, without additional costs relating to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederation is also “a strong Polish army based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers”.
Candidates to Seim stressed the need to increase the number of armies.
They also say that we need easier access to weapons.
In economic matters, they stressed the need for “permanent access to energy”.
"We can gasify the coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy, and we need to consider returning to the idea of the nuclear power plant," said Peter Karpinski, the fifth in the election list.
The Mexican cartel chief stands for one third of the drugs in the United States
Chicago – immediately after the sunrise on West Side in Chicago CBS News reported the morning chase for drugs.
Brian McKnight from the Narcotics Office (DEA) showed in full light what's going on.
In Chicago last year, almost 800 people died of drug overdose.
McKnight claimed "probably 90%" drugs in Chicago originated in Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican Narcotic Lord Nemesio Cervantese, just known as El Mencho.
"This is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for the federal implementing authorities in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, the main DEA agent in Mexico.
El Mencho's award is $10 million.
He helped discover the dozens placed in the jungle of El Mencho drug laboratories.
El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generation, or CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs reaching the United States by land and seaway.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel transmitted “tonnes” of cocaine, metamphetamines and heroin polluted by fentanyl.
El Mencho's head is waiting for a $10 million prize.
For irony, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug charges and finally deported to Mexico.
That's where he created a brutal cartel.
He has a huge amount of weapons, RPG, weapons of caliber 50.
In general, he has its own SWAT teams," Donahue added.
El Mencho has no punishment to protect his empire by using such measures as the shooting of the Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in public hanging this summer.
In recent years, the brutality of the cartel led to thousands of murders.
According to Mexican government statistics, there are approximately 94 murders daily.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they cannot be handled without protective equipment.
In the lab of the cocaine package, it is a mark of a smuggler.
For more than one third of them, signs lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending a poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when someone dies, Donahue says there is a “great chance ” that drugs come from an El Mencho organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died from overdose last year.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed President of France and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macrone and the first lady – says the French Prosecutor.
The accused ensures that he has documents that compromise the presidential pair.
He asked the boss of the state of 300,000 euros in cash.
A man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in the police in France claims he received "explosive" documents from a person employed in the Elise Palace.
During the interrogations, he explained that these documents do not only compromise the presidential pair, but the exhibition of them entirely could at all endanger the security of Macron and the First Lady of France.
In return, 300 thousand euros were required – he also wanted to get a apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters from the previous marriage.
According to the prosecutor, he refused to transfer the police the documents he spoke about.
He foretold that he will transmit them to the media – but it is not yet known if these documents exist.
They were not found during a review in this 27-year-old apartment.
A man was subjected to psychiatric studies, but the doctors did not detect any serious disorders.
PS4 game will be old – Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony throws more light on the debutting game soon available only on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony, in its recent State of Play presentation, announced that the Prime Minister of the Last of Us will take place in February 2020.
The fans could also see a new piece of breathing in the breast of the arrival game.
More specifications have been revealed in the days after the loud precinct of the play of The Last of Us 2.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are reaching the old-stage climate in many ways.
It was decided to do something we haven't seen too often since the PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several tiles.
Neil Druckmann from Naughty Dog confirmed this in a remarkable telegraph intelligence, explaining that the sequel grew up to one of the largest games in history.
"The fabula is ambitious and incorporated in aspects where the one was not," he said.
She must have been so extensive that she could present this kind of story with so many figures.
We didn't mean to create the largest game, it just happened.
“We are exploited by the awareness of how many opportunities are hidden in this history. There will be moments when you think you're going to the end, but you'll realize that it's just the beginning and that it's starting a completely new chapter”, says Druckmann.
It's such an ambitious game that it didn't fit on one BluRay and it's on two tiles.
Otherwise, it has been revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two easter eggis of adults (information given by Gamestpot).
We're not gonna break a surprise, but the easter eggi games refer to Naughty Dog's old sculptures.
More information will you learn when The Last of Us: Part Two debuts on 21 February 2020 only to PS4.
Persons with PS4 can prepare for the sequel premiere by reaching The Last of us Remastered available in the PS Plus offer.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, including the above production of Naughty Dog.
PS Plus subscriptions will also have access to MLB The Show 19 since October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and you want to make a pre-prime order for the sequel, Sony said that there will be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing the replica of Ellie's backpack and her bracelet and a 30-centimetric figure of this cultivation figure.
Run, scatter and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil will take the Podbeskid and willing to win.
Football players of Stomil are invincible from three rows.
The guardians of Peter Zautzkovski at that time gained seven points because they won with Stalla Mélec and Choiniczanka Choinice, and in the last match, a wireless remiss in the Swallows.
Now the Olstein team on Saturday at 18 a.m. will take the Subbeskid, which is exchanged as one of the favorites to advance to Extraclass.
The nearest rivals of Stomila take the fourth seat in the table and have the advantage of the Olstine team.
The Subbeskid on the trips in this season played six times and it took two victories, remises and defeats, however, Stomil is very well at its facility – at the stadium at Al. Plsudsky 69a Peter Zajczykowski team won three times and once lost.
In the 10th row, they collected 17 points and are in the head of the table, although after two failures in the games, they did not predict that.
"Every change takes time to make the results," Peter Skiba explains.
"We can also work under normal conditions.
We're just focusing on a ball game.
They're clean heads, there's a good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training headquarters."
On Tuesday, footballers removed Stomil from Poland’s Poland Movement, but they needed a series of punishment to play.
In Southern Poland, Peter Skib, Gregorz Lech and Janus Bucholc did not ride, because Coach Zautzkovski let these key players rest before the Saturday fight with Podbeskid.
But in Chorzov, he played back after the injury of Jacob Mosakovski, who finally shot his long-expected gateway.
"It's always fun to get a naked, and I've arrived at the moment that we can keep playing in the bowls (Mosakowski equipped at 3:3 in 119 minutes - red).
Dad used to bite me and laugh that I couldn't get a gateway, and I always told him I would shoot at the moment he wouldn't expect."
Now Mosakowski is counting on returning to the basic composition, even more that because of the yellow cards he cannot play Olé Tarasenko.
"I therefore strike hard on training so that I can play in the first ingredient," Mosakovski says.
“I did everything in Chorzov to present myself as best as possible.
However, whether I play or sit on the reservation club, I'll still be strongly supporting the team.
Because the most important thing is the team and three points in the Subbeskid game.
Surely we have a difficult meeting in which the victory will have to run, explode and fight."
In the middle of the Olstinic defense, Raphal Remish can play, who has also recently acquired a trauma, so if it occurs, we will find out only on Saturday, more than that Coach Zautzkovski traditionally ends the staff's efforts to keep the matter secret.
A man raped and killed his nephew.
"You will never see the daily light.
You'll never breathe fresh air again," Judge Kevin K. Allen said, calling Alex Whipple again.
"What you did was so disgusting and bad that you had to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days until Whipple indicated the body's hiding place.
"How could someone do this to his nephew?", asked Deay Smith, a girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," Alex Whipple said.
"I would give everything to meet her again, to hug her," said the mother of a murdered girl.
"Our life will never be the same," added a crushed woman.
As Fox News informs, 22-year-old Whipple did not show any emotions during the interrogation.
Last month, he confessed that he kidnapped, used sexually and killed a girl.
A man’s lawyer found that his client was raised in “perfect family. ”
He was meant to be abused as a child.
He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is willing to be punished.
The man was sentenced to life without the possibility of demanding a conditional release.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would deliver nearly 100 million dollars of additional resources to the communities affected by the drought.
The funding programme for farmers affected by the drought will be extended and the criteria for allocation of supplements to holdings will be simplified.
The aid package covers almost $34 million for the initiative of support for the drought communities, thus allowing the eligible farm to receive up to $3,000 in sudden cases.
Each of the 13 local self-governmental areas under the Programme of Assistance to the Soul affected Communities will receive up to $1 million grants for infrastructure and assistance in dealing with the impacts of disasters.
The new support package is a supplement to more than $7 billion awarded by the government for the Foundation for the Fight against Drought.
Frostpunk - a strategic game connecting the production features of the city-builder with a unique simulator of the 19th century society and freezing survival – is approaching the planned on 11 October premier on consoles.
11 bit studio has made every effort to create a strategic game in which intuitively and naturally can be played using a console controller.
Frostpunk: Console Edition on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 was therefore built from the basis in some matters.
Among the main changes are the remodeled control system and the updated user interface with new election wheels, quick access actions and comfortable grouping available in the building game.
For all console players who don't know Frostpunk, we have to introduce a freezing universum game in the form of a fabulary:
Frostpunk is a game dealing with survival over the edge of society in which warmth means life, and every decision has its price.
The task of the player is to build on a frozen freeze of the city, whose heart is a pair generator.
Now a comprehensive, strategic game, connected with a rich fabula and an incomparable survival experience, will be available on consoles.
Frostpunk: Console Edition will be a real test for your tactical knowledge.
Traitors of Chinese (In the name of the Love China's Mistress Busters)
documentary film: In China in the last decade, the number of divorces increased twice.
The cause of this situation was generally the third parties.
Increasingly more men maintain extra-married relations, which has led to a special industry in this country — a professional lover who is a task to save the marriage of betrayed wives.
Let's scan up loud: Ma-te-uch!
Trying to welcome the Prime Minister in the Sweekers
A special test was conducted before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateus Moravec in the Slastic Pekars.
"Dear Lord, louder, louder, so we will not welcome Mr Prime Minister here!
Let's scand out loud: Ma-te-uch!", he encouraged a strong leader.
Unfortunately, the enthusiastic leader’s efforts did not produce the expected result.
The campaign is in progress.
Politicians ride around the country, convincing voters to each other.
The intense campaign is also held by Prime Minister Mateus Moravecki, who is a common guest in this region as leader of the PS's letter.
Each meeting is scheduled exactly, including the correction.
It was, rather, in the Sweekers.
A special guest should be welcomed specially.
Before meeting with the Prime Minister, he decided to make a general test.
As an exhaustive leader, he tried to encourage the crowd to scandal the name of the chief of the government.
"This will not be a welcome for me, but for Mr. Prime Minister of Moravec!
Also louder, more loud, my dear ones!", he encouraged the enthusiasm.
Unfortunately, the crowd was not fully abducted by the hot names of the man and was unwilling to answer "Ma-te-ush", but the enthusiastic footage of the leader makes a furore online.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man sentenced for murder of his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was sentenced for the murder of Stephen and Katie Stay in 2014 and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered Stay's house on 9 July 2014, asking for the disclosure of his wife's stay, Melannie Haskell, with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4 years old, and two girls aged 9 and 7 died when Haskell opened the fire, according to the Office of the Sheriff of the County of Harris.
Only one family member survived, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities claimed she was severely injured, but she was able to recover completely.
On Thursday, the jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of unreadability.
The jury will gather again on Monday to make a judgment.
quantum Internet getting closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The results of the U.S. Army's research are going on a quantum internet a step closer.
Such an Internet could offer military opportunities for safety, detection and precision of time inaccessible with traditional approach to networking.
The Centre for the Disseminated Quantum Processing of the Military Research Laboratory for the Development of the Opportunities of the Fighting of the American Army was looking at researchers from the University of Insbruck, who have achieved the record transfer of the state between the matter and the light – 50 km from the use of the light cable.
The complication is a correlation that can form between the quantums such as the cubits.
When two cubits are connected and measured by one of them, it will affect the measurement made on the other of them, even if the other cubit is physically remote.
“These [50 km] are two lines of size as far as it was previously possible, and it is an executive distance to start building inter-town quantum networks”, said Dr. Ben Lanyon, experimental physicist from the University of Innsbruck and the main researcher in the project, whose discovery was published in the Nature magazine, section Quantum Information.
The intermediate quantum networks would consist of remote nodes of the physical network of cubits that are connected with each other despite a large physical distance.
Researchers have argued that this distraction of the connected state is necessary to create a quantum internet.
"This demonstration is a major step forward to reaching a wide-scale distracted state," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-operating with the military programme supporting these studies.
The quality of the state connected on the second end is also high enough to meet some of the most difficult quantum network uses.
The research team started an experiment with a calcium atom captured in the ion trap.
With the laser bonds, the researchers entered the quantum state in the ion, simultaneously encouraging it to emit the photon in which the quantum information was recorded.
As a result, the quantum states of atom and particles of light were connected.
The challenge is to transmit the photon with light cables.
"The photon emitted by the ion calcium has the length of the wave of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the lightwater," Lanyon said.
Hence, his team initially sent a part of light through the neline crystal highlighted by a strong laser radiation.
Fotone wave length has been converted into optimum value from a large distance perspective — the current standard telecommunications length of the wave is 1550 nanometers.
Then the researchers sent this photo through a 50-mile light cable.
Their measurements show that atoms and particles of light were still connected even after the wave was transformed and passed.
“A decision to choose calcium means that the result is a direct way to create a connected atomic clock network on large physical distances, as calcium can be bound with high quality of the ‘clock’ cubit.
The Army is very much interested in connected clock networks built at a large scale in view of the use of precise positions, precise navigation and time synchronization," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher, who also cooperates with the programme.
