There's a big return to the Czech smaller.
Paul French was called to NHL
The Czech hockey brancer Paul French, who has been passing through a difficult period of his career in recent months, returns to NHL.
The eleven-year-old swimming family will be on the front door, and so soon he can get into the branch.
The former brankar Litvinova, Plizna or Russian Čeljabinsk was injured in preparation for NHL in October this year.
He was in the middle of a fight with Vegas, and since then he hasn't been presented on the NHL clusis yet.
The incident occurred at the moment the experienced branker moved from one to the other.
"Paul French will be out of about three to four weeks with injuries in the bottom of the body," the total of Denver announced in the beginning of October.
His return to the NHL gateway eventually extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning, an American time was called from a farm where he took four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he added 94.5% of the operations.
The hockey reconstitutor wants to finally settle and confirm that it belongs to the world's best league.
In his last year, he had problems with bullets, and in a short pandemic anniversary, he did not catch the only struggle.
In NHL, “Francik” took 36 matches, its success of the operations is 92.3%.
Charles puts Camille on the Christmas wish, William and Kate are positioned in Jordan
The British Prince William and his wife Kate as a Christmas wish this year chose a family photograph taken during the journey to Jordan.
He also published his wishes by Prince Charles, who used a photograph on which his house Camille helps to put a gun on.
On its website, the British news station BBC informed it.
The wishes send to their friends, coworkers, and the funds they cooperate with.
The photo came up somewhere in the desert land.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in haki color and dress also has Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is wearing as princes George and Louis's shirts and a shirt with a limb.
Whoever took the photograph, William and Kate didn't introduce, is not even clear when it came up.
Last year, the royal family for a photograph designed as Christmas wishes posted on a pack of slams before a bunch of wood in its rural village in the County of Norfolk.
The picture that serves as a Christmas wish was also published by the successor of the throne of Prince Charles with his wife Camilla.
The photographer Sam Hussein caught him in June at the Ascot reaches.
Charles, who's got a cylinder on his head and a gun on his face, helps Camille put on her armor colorfully sweeted with light dresses.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz promised Berbrovi a million for the title, the hardman denyed it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption cause allegedly worked with the accused former Vice-President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr to have a promised million crowns from Prague Slavia for a league title in season 2018/19.
He informed the efotbal server by getting to the part of the police records.
The Chairman of the High Club, Jaroslav Tvrďk, stated that the red whites did not allow any corruption.
The server published a rescription of police hearings, in which Slavia represents mostly its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended in the summer at the championship club.
The former influential official of the red whites was in common contact with Berbre and the former sports director of the secondoligical Eastern Eastern Roman Rogos, who is also in case among the accused.
Criminalists reportedly worked with information that Slavia Berbrovi promised a financial reward for getting a title.
2019 won SK Slavia Prague title in the first liaison.
The Police Authority has been able to know that Roman (Berbr) should win in the liaison from SK Slavia Prague officials, the promised million bribe, quoted by the server from the record.
A day later, according to criminals, Berbr met not only with Nemar but also with the President of Slavia Tvrďa.
From the file on the server, the police are still dealing with this information.
He refused any corruption.
In 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in the Czech football and offered a opposition alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal negotiations, we have not pursued the impact of judges in contrast with the rules of fair play and we have not provided any financial implementation in this regard to anyone," the verdict for the List of Report said.
In the hearings, among other things, Nezmar selectively insults some former players Slavia Dark skin and also condemns his former boss Hardhead.
The cause of the alleged impact of the fights through the judges has been dispatched by police intervention in several places in the middle of October, including the FACHR Prague.
The highest in the affair is Berbr, who no longer figures in any of the football functions.
In mid January, he was released from custody, just as the former sports director of Vishgrad Rogoz was released.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
The works will be new, but in principle worse type (the artillery must carry bullets manually without cover).
Cars - Toyots hi-lux - are new and good
Trailers and various pencil vehicles - at a fair level, more than that, they have already managed to get rid of Prague V3S even in specialized units.
Aeroplanes: fight-decent, but at the end of the rental, the traffic is too small with a short rail, but modern.
Drones - small and only small types without a fighting potential
Rackets - we don't have at all (but we're making and exporting to abroad)
PVO: middle - cold, aged; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like that.
I've got a chase right next to the city.
They drove nutrie from the river and did damage in the plants, so I was sitting there.
When I came, I saw a fisherman on the river's side.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly, and the guy didn't think he noticed me.
I was hoping he'd leave before anything came out, but, of course, a fox went in a moment.
I let her come 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost fucked up, waving his head on all sides, so I called him that it was on the fox.
Before I got out of the seat, it was gone.
I mean, and a luxury man be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it'd have to be a summary of a lot of coincidence to happen, you'd probably be seen in the termistics that almost everyone has today.
So to the visible place, dear things to put your feet in your sleeping room, and you should be okay.
Wartech versus Hamaček.
Inside, the respirators have gained significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state responsible for shopping and distribution of pipes, masks and respirators for the profession of the coronavir has issued billions of crowns for their acquisition in the past weeks.
The server iRozlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts for the respirator differed by hundreds of crowns.
Why did the prices move so dramaticly?
Which authorities have acted economically?
And why did the others shore the drought?
Lenka Kabrhel speaks to the iRozlas Dominica Kubišt server.
I appreciate soldiers and troops (not affected by memories of the CHSLs that have been done by older generations), but the CRC cannot benefit from the obligatory war.
We don't even have a lot of techniques that training can take, we don't actually have modern techniques or existing professionals, and also modern techniques are increasingly complex, so the powers of the bookers will rapidly lose in time.
The modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can put them, will happen very quickly, there will be no time to practice someone again.
And eventually, the applicants/territorial defence are of great importance to countries such as Ukraine, where they are going to lead a mass geril, and it is also an expression of need to dismantle the enemy.
There will be only a fight on the territory of the Czech Republic in the conflict of such range and intensity where the gerilla will be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography.
mostly we don't have individual skills.
That's not the worst.
The worst thing is, half of them play like they have it.
Then it's a situation that you're looking at like a dude who didn't hit the empty gate two minutes ago, he's going to attack himself between two or even three swissmens and you say "Tweed, and what do you think it's going to happen now?"
Of course they're picking him up as an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill "to be defense" is so horrible that I'm caught that I'm sincerely surprised to see our attacker was able to play a player of a rival.
First sheets
Covid's pandemia slows down, however, the experts do not expect a major turnout for the next weeks.
The efforts in hospitals according to statistical models will still last for a while and the pandemic equation has arrived, as we know, a new unknown: a variety of omicrons which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it cannot be absolutely certain whether it can cause more progress, as much as helps vaccination or post-infection immunity obtained by previous disease processing.
But this week the unexpected phenomenon on the side of pluss also entered the covided equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new medicine has arrived in Czech Republic, the antivirotics of molnupiravir, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be complemented by paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports the success of even 85 percent.
The first supplies of molnupiravir to Czech Republic, however, emphasized the question of how this administration is prepared for incoming medicines.
As it was said, the first patient in the country will get a molnupiravir of Merck.
The company ended on the tape first, even because the medicinal product began to develop long before the current pandemia was exploded to find appropriate treatment for the virus disease of horses on the South American continent.
In these studies, people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.) are often deprived of the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
they are generally less open and openly do not share their views.
That's why Eastern Europeans, and especially the Czechs, are used to say "how our dentist grew up."
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most of you will say no.
In the West, they'll tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how the Czechs are racist bullshit.
And then they go and choose parties like AfD.
They're afraid to cancel culture, to say this in public means loss of work and media linch.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, the west is good, the east is bad.
But they'll really find out what people think.
It's only in France Le Pen and Zemmoura, both have over 20% according to their research.
We even know that the objects are three and totally identical in Czech Republic.
The same because of the rotation of units so that soldiers don't have to learn where they are again, so all the objects on the hair are the same.
From one is the Atom Museum of Brdy, and the rest of the two are abandoned.
It is fun that the SSR did not want nuclear heads in its own territory either because of safety or speed of the planting of heads because of the western location.
In those underground covers (in each javor there are two) only the heads were stored not all the missiles as they say.
If it was necessary to put this weapon on, a special unit came to pick this head up and mount on some nose device.
Besides the museum's javor, the remains in the desolate state.
At the second grade of the primary school, we had a Gypsy classmate, four years with him.
He was pretty cool, he was making good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but it was our maskot.
Everyone had a conversation with him, often walked and wanted to explain something, missing a little, walked regularly, sported with us, didn't steal foods, nor phones, walked cleanly dressed.
He was driving schools in nature, doing different monkeys, but he was okay, maybe never shit.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the cousins, the Gypsies, the same class, the other classes.
Shortly, the teacher was beaten, the police often dealt with something there, threatened and threatened other students.
I personally sell something to advertise sometimes (old things that I don't need, etc.) and I've been selling frequently to the Cigans, money have always had, they didn't try to drag me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold the car like that, the guy called in a month that he already switched it to himself.
I'm saying about myself that I'm not racist, I don't care if anyone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as he acts as he belongs in a decent society (works, works, women don't beat, just normal behaviour).
But when someone comes, pulls his hand, resides in apartments and houses, he's just having a mess around, he's making problems, so it's the color he has, but it's gonna bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, they start business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If he believes in Allah, I don't care until they respect my traditions and culture, I'll be theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachaticka
"A young woman suffered a severe multitude injury and despite reconciliation care, she, unfortunately, suffered its injuries in the spot," said the Law speaker of the Southern Czech health saviors Zuzan Faitl.
Probably a driver who took the girl was guilty of the crash.
The 18-year-old driver of the Peugeot mark drove probably in the direction of the village of Žižovec to the village of Bavorov and arrived from undetected causes before.
After the defeat of Scodau Octavia ended the Peugeot car on the roof outside the car, she described the incident of the speaker of the Southern Czech Police, Stefanka Schwarz.
A young driver of Peugota suffered a very serious injury in an accident.
It was a lot of injuries and remained sworn in the car.
Once he was released, acute pre-health care had to be provided, and in a stable state, he was transported airly to the Czech-Buddy Hospital, established by Faitl's savior.
She added that a man in the second car suffered a lighter breast injury and was transported to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from other countries outside the EU, customers often do not add data about them
Luke Neuheisl orders from abroad even several times a month.
He acquires collective cards mainly.
"Usually it can be dozens of dollars, for example, ten dollars higher, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free," the collector approaches.
Since October, the ordering of small shipments has been slightly irritated, the new VAT must be added and the mail shall be transmitted to the customs proceedings.
He's got an e-mail with a message that the customers expect a package to come.
Then it is sufficient to fill out the data on the shipment, and if the VAT has not been included in the sales, the customs office shall measure it from the total amount of the shipment and transport.
In the event that the applicant does not provide the customs procedure itself, the compensation of the carrier shall also be added to the total amount.
According to Luke Neuheisla, the whole process is not complicated.
I'm gonna click on one or two crush boxes, put two applies, and I'm done.
It's mostly a question of five minutes for me, says Neuheisl.
Not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
The new customs rules have fallen to the international mail in Prague the daily number of shipments accepted from abroad from 60 000 to 15 000.
According to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to the calls for the supply of data necessary to complete customs proceedings.
Currently there are 30,000 shipments on the international mail that we have to process.
If people were filling all the information they needed and filling them in time, we would be around half here, says the Czech Mail spokesman Matias Vitík.
Inflation solution
See the title, how would you suggest solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation and its next growth is expected.
What should he stand in your opinion to slow this growth or compensate?
Do we see in Poland a reduced VAT on food and PHM, is this a way for you?
What do you think happens, what's inevitable about where it's going?
Prices grow faster than payments, I think it is unavoidable that people will not be able to afford common things, especially energy.
How much have you received added (who is the employee)?
I was added to 2% this year in rough, which is a laugh, but fortunately, I have a similar profit from the business I operate in employment.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why the proofly convicted violents are sending themselves behind the nets for only six months?
This just doesn't mind how the court can only send such a animal for six months behind the nets just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have a trauma for several years, negatively affecting her sexual relations and relations in general.
And not to mention that the victim of rape doesn't have to be reconsidered again.
Isn't this going to be a potential future rape report?
A man from the Death "poured" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Grave helped the officers to ensure his entirely searched girlfriend from Kostomlat, on whom was issued an arrest order.
Because he called them to her himself.
Well, he went to it with a little bit.
First, he contacted the circuit and invented a story that he was robbed.
The officers came to the place after calling for the oppression line and didn't wonder when the alleged “the robbery” told them that he invented everything to make up the officers to arrive.
In fact, he just wanted to advise officers how to make a notification to the CRC police.
In checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found out that the woman is on the list of persons who were searched, in the full state search, and she was issued a warrant for arrest.
The case is therefore addressed by the PCR.
Honest question for people here, do you think our country is Slovak?
I personally feel that the words in ethnic or cultural times have not been, but I would be interested in you.
Otherwise, I agree with the memo :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slovenian language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question whether a rational person can really trust anything completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I would not consider such a case personally as true faith.
Here with Pascal, I can't agree, there's an estimate in the world, if I'm not wrong, about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or gods should a man choose?
I would say that it is likely that there is at least one god in one of those thousands of religions that will punish you unpleasantly if you believe in the gods of another.
And even in the tenth, there is no other god than Yahweh.
So wouldn't it be more reasonable in that case to abstain from faith in any god than risking to choose wrong from those thousands of gods and that one true god I just didn't hit, send me to hell or something like that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent incorporation in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar to me.
X months of training (in various specializations, X months per month) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If a man is good, he can get a professional offer.
All the ACR files would use something like that.
It could be done in collaboration with the University of Defense.
We can talk like this: There is constantly a failing collaboration between the education sector and industry, the company hunts in schools, and there is some laying down when the work force migrates from educational institutions into working conditions.
Not only when you grow up, but this process goes on constantly, each of us constantly learns something new, moves from one area to another, and so on.
Similar flows should work between the civil and the military sector.
I also see it as a way to build a relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that Russia, Germany or Mongolian rider will never enter here again.
I think it's funny how you think NATO is something that's stuck in the stone, we have allies, and they're going to defend us if there's a mess.
Well, please you.
There are only one choice in the U.S. that will circulate their budget and the whole NATO is going to dick.
The English exchanges us for Russian money, the Germans exchange us for the Russian gas, and the Polaci have turned out to show them their back and take what they want.
The only thing that long-termly works as a guarantee of self-dependence is the armed army and the population who can control the military technique of their time.
And today he can fly remotely controlled means every teenager, so he can't.
We don't need border reinforcement, that's a shit today, but a teenager playing behind a remote control device can handle it.
How to not drown in box tsunami
Do you unpack the gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you're in the house with boxes and fillings?
This waste is reused by e-shops that lack the package materials.
So there was a map of trades that your used boxes would welcome.
And it's not just Christmas.
All packaging materials are proposed to endure repeated manipulation.
That's why it's a shame to treat them as a single waste.
Anyone can bring them into an integrated trade (KAMSNIM.cz project map contains approximately 150) carton boxes, plastic or paper fill.
This supports small companies, reduces the quantity of waste created and also avoids filled with blue containers.
Trade itself welcome packagings which are currently on the market of deficiencies and saved money, since the packaging carton for the last period has betrayed by 50 %.
In the eyes of ecologically thoughtful customers, I also strengthen my mark.
One of these trades is TIERRA VERDE, producer of the eco of drugs and cosmetic eco.
However, the boxes and filling material are being driven to the Brn’s Powders to which individuals are gathered home, and also the companies with which we have contracted regular links of postponed cards.
We'll use everything in packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we together create a more respective world.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for the next generations, says Petra Lopušnik from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMSNIM.cz shows not only separator sites for packaging materials.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (which takes the classified waste from the household, where you give past medicines, tyres, servicing electricity, batteries, light sources, large volumes of waste, etc.).
Any waste can end in the right place and re-use things will find their other home.
In total, the project map contains more than 100 000 such places.
“Steply there are collective courts, re-using centres, containers for textile, food banks, charitable trades, SWAPs and other places that help find use for things that would otherwise become wasteless”, Miroslav Kubasek added, one of the authors of the application from the community, Let's clean up Czech Republic.
It makes me feel bad that technology today is so simple and stupid that children who use computer or phone play games on it, but they will not learn basic computer skills.
A problem has recently occurred (principally in English articles) that students of high schools do not understand the principle of computer files.
Because maybe Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones are just hiding the underlying filesystem with folders and all throws on one screen in the application.
Let them use the technique since they were children, but mostly let them learn something.
Let's overwrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency in January – and it was great.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he discovered the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street - and mentioned so many actions that they were not able to arrive in six months.
But the French politics like it, and they like the voters.
Machron's supporters of the right and left-handed dispersals are compatible with little, but it is in Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections of the head of the state in April.
Election calendar also affected the priorities.
The French leader mentioned, inter alia, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such history work.
A number of commentators immediately accelerated the criticism that Macrone is about pro-European propaganda and rewrites history.
In fact, it's rather trying to rewrite history.
The extremely right candidate for French President Éric Zemmour is now circling France with the fact that the Vichy regime, who collaborate with Hitler during World War II, has not been so bad, and has quite a success with the French.
Let's try to take Macron's idea of one history book seriously and let's not look at the event in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story we versus them and never like a whole story.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs find out who's beaten in which battle.
But if they don't have an enlightened cantor, they won't know what the broader context of the event was.
The year's movie is Quo Vadis, Aida?
The Czech Mouses didn't win.
A story that returns to a massacre in Srebrenica in 1995 also received appreciation for directing and for the best actress Jasna Duričić.
At this year's Karlovar festival, he was held on the first parts of the audience stairs.
Anthony Hopkins became the best actor in Berlin for the movie Father.
I'm not too young, I'm not too healthy and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like, "I don't have a flu/be dried" a few days I had a diarrhoea and I didn't have the taste of smoking...
Besides the normal flu, it was worse.
I don't have a diarrhoea influenza.
I don't say everyone's got it.

The trains are starting to ride according to the new driving order, somewhere the carriers change.
Since Sunday, they start driving trains according to the new driving order.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some tracks, for example between Ostow over Labe and Kolin, where the Czech road begins to ride RegioJet.
For most lines only the time of departure is adjusted, if possible softly and their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the railways.
The carriers started selling tickets during the autumn.
The Czech roads plan to translate a day in the new driving order in the average of 6783 personal transport compounds, which will be the average of 478 remote trains per day.
The trains ride during a new ride order of approximately 118 million miles.
Roads next to national compounds within the new driving order will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
The company, along with the new driving order, puts on dozens of new trains.
The main news will be the InterJet trains that will ride on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be transported in northern Morava or in Western Czech Republic.
Since the next year, the carrier also traditionally increases the prices of the ride, average by 3.2 per cent.
Roads take into account inflation in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJetu driving order is the entry to the R23 Oste of Labe – Majnik – Nimburg – Kolin.
The carrier here will replace the Czech Roads after success in the Ministry of Transport.
The RegioJet will be on the trail every day to report a total of 16 compounds, eight in each direction.
Other changes relate to remote connections between Prague and Brn, which will also be stopped in the Havičkov Brod stations from Sunday, the Barrier over Sazawa and the Colin.
Leo Express maintained his 16 compounds, two reverse links to Slovakia, and also the weekend connection to Krakova.
According to speaker Emil Sedalarik, the carrier also tried to maintain as much as possible travel time as possible for his remote trains.
Without great changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should also continue.
The carrier will also exchange in some regional trails.
Changes are expected for example to travel to Czech Republic, where on the trail from Youth Boleslavi through Czech Lípa to Rumburg will be driven by Trilex of the German company Die Länderbahn instead of the Czech roads.
Travelers will also be able to use single railway rides in the second year.
As in the Czech Roads, their price is increased by 3.2 per cent inflation.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning how to view the other side?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, as they were oppressed, and they had to quit, dying.
In my life, I haven't heard a lesson from a slave party's perspective or since then, no one's defending this, just condemning.
No one even tells you at school that black people were often selling to slave themselves and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one in school teaches you that the colonists often bought the land from the Indians, they're just telling you everywhere how brutally we, the Europeans, killed them, killing each other a long time.
I spent a while in the United States, right in schools, in northern schools and in the south.
I didn't see anyone intentionally silent the facts, but I've heard that it's happening before, and I think it's a problem, I don't deny it.
My point was that history is not black-white and that we have the tendency to look at it from today's view, without understanding.
History doesn't care about someone's feelings, it's just what she is and I think it's a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at things from the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from her and never repeat this again.
By the way, when we're in those Southern States, yes, the confederation flag and the famous slaves there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and I thought absurd to reject them.
Furthermore, North wasn't much better than a lot of people today idealize it.
And many people also forget that not all in the South were slaves, and a lot of things were opposed to them.
I wouldn't compare this with the Russians, deliberately ignore some facts, lies and manipulates, in addition, our view of them does not exist (in YT was also a video from the television where they turned off someone who started talking about our legions and 1968).
What I felt funny at the U.S. schools was the rising of Marxism and idealizing communism, something that their land never experienced.
In general, I realized that some universities were awkward, these students were pretty traditional, and those schools were supporting them in a number of times.
And if I imagine that these people will once be much older, I'm a little sick that this might be the voice of most, because they're among youths and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that maybe feminism has reached what he had and is not about the same thing, he's betrayed himself.
Currently, as feminists, those who have nothing to do with him and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT, leading to radicalisation on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even with quite reasonable things.
Plus, the more people are radical, the more they hear him.
In any event, I also did not meet someone who would condemn me for colonialism or slavery.
I met the wrong geographic, but it was both sides.
Not because I wouldn't like it here, but because I think it's totally unreasonable.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
Furthermore, I consider the concept of nationality generally inadequate in terms of personal identity.
If I have something to do with people like that, the views of the world and the common experiences, not the place where we were born.
I'm not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic farity here, one is Ukrainian and the second Slovak.
That Slovenian pharacist is a very nice man, he's more a teologian than politics, but then he always screws up some dick about the coronavir that everyone's ashamed.
Then, of course, here is the Church of Czechoslovakia Gusit.
They're officially protestants, but they're actually born from a Catholic modern and they're truly Catholic without the pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they're going to worship gusits, because it's theologically much similar, but members are mostly liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically valuable functional temple on Botanica Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michal on the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominican Square and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they do the Mass in Latin, as it was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in Czech, the scouts took it from Austria
Brzeclav — The Flame in Bethlehem, where Jesus Christ was born according to Christian tradition, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the pandemic of coronavir but even this time, they took him from their Austrian colleagues on the border crossing Reintal – Brzeclav.
He was taken over on the border last year.
Bethlehem’s light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we attend every year with the division, I look forward to it.
It is a honour to me that I was chosen to tell the present journalists Amalia Budjik.
While last year the transfer was carried out on the border crossing of Mikulov-Drasenhofen, directly on the border bridge, now on Reintal-Breclav on the parking lot.
Usually, the scouts ride a train to Vienna.
There's no change in the divorce of the flame after the Czech Republic.
With Bethlehem’s light, the scouts went traditionally to Brna, where he was handed over to the diet bishop of Vojtech Cicrelem.
On Saturday, 18 December, the next light divorce will take care of scouts who will travel with the selected speeds and personal trains.
They will take light from them in local scouts or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flame in the Czech Republic and where the railways do not lead.
Even this year, the scouts must follow the applicable measures against the spread of coronavir.
It's just like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local actions to wear routines, to try to keep the distances, to not sing their colleagues, to act as safe as possible, the speaker of the betlemic light Zuzanna Hrbková described.
The tradition of the Bethlehem light traveling through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time with the flame.
Bethlehem’s light is a symbol of hope for the believers, the light that overcomes the darkness.
In Czech Republic, scouts and skauts have been taking care of his spread for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of insecurity and human mutuality.
All updates, including a list of places where people can come for flame, can be found on www.betlemskelo.cz.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the grounds of the economy which confirm that grants are cancer of the economy, but I don't think the grant as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water detention), health and education uses the money properly, but I don't understand why the money is placed in agriculture, industry and in general to companies.
As mentioned -- the product is produced and it breaks the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work alone in a factory where the hallways are millions of "xy funded/co-financed by project xy" and such a company is just an artificial retainer in life.
This is not the support of the company that gives work to people, this is the rapid development when this company is both holding up and collecting orders/workers to companies that could grow and be more productive after its disappearance.
Full consent, it's awful.
Sometimes a person who has been born in the Internet is also captured in a trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don't think the Internet advertisements are moving with me, but then I'm going to catch that they have influenced me -- it's just so exhausted that you don't always try to stop it.
I also therefore support the radical votes in the European Parliament, which currently wish to prohibit the full programme (= targeted) advertising...
It's all bullshit, with classic words, I'd ban the Internet.
I feel like this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe anything that most believes and makes sense, but I am not a sheep, but I would rather believe something that is less likely, it doesn't make much sense, but it is important that I will have my own original opinion that I will claim that it is a critical thought."
2. "I won't believe everything the media say"
3. "I don't believe politics"
Television fails in the trend of Christmas movies, the Prime Minister has two hundred this year.
Los Angeles – China, television stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English speaking countries have fallen down in the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will present them to their prime ministers recording more than two hundred.
It was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
The genre of Christmas Family and Romantic Films in recent years points and dramatically increases tracking, so these pictures are growing increasingly.
This year it took four times more Christmas movies than in 2011 and twice more than five years ago.
The IMDb database included only the images that have the word Christmas (Christmas) in its name, so it will actually be much more.
The films that people traditionally connected with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic this period is particularly related to tales, worldly populars are also pictures Sam at home, love of heaven or classic Christmas story Life is beautiful since 1946.
The right boom of Christmas images but started until in 2009, when a special film series arrived by the US Cable Station Hallmark, the BBC server recalled.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas (Delivering to Christmas) then included four films and was very successful.
This year, this station began to play on Christmas by 22 October and present 42 Christmas photos.
The Lifetime Competitive Station has 35 new Christmas topic films this year and also contributes to the total number of popular stream platforms, such as Netflix.
"In this magic period of history, it doesn't matter so much, it is important that there are many Christmas trees in the background and that they snow," he describes with the overstairs this genre Brandon Gray, the author of the book on Christmas movies called I'll be home for Christmas films (For Christmas Films I'll be home).
"For the audience, it is a form of escape and the way for at least two hours to feel a little peace in the middle of all the holiday madness and the world's madness in which we live for the last few years," Gray added.
For example, Hallmark’s television still uses the same prescription that is uniform but successful for its films.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there will be about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding, which, of course, will be resolved, and those two will kiss.
This is how it's all around, and as long as all the movies look like this and they have a similar atmosphere, people watch each other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, not affecting the final F1 race.
To the Great Price Abu Kill in formula 1, only nineteen riders will go.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not affect the last race of the season.
Stay Haas sends only one formula on the trail.
In the last season race, he was supposed to attack a better location from the 20th qualifications he had.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas Station will not eventually affect the Great Price of Abu Kill.
Because he was positively tested on covid-19.
At the starting roof, only nineteen cars will appear, from the last line, to the trail of Mazepin's team colleague Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen who struggled with Lewis Hamilton in direct battle.
Mazepin is relatively fine according to the Haas Stay and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita's physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now in isolation and will be followed by the instructions of the competent public health authorities, and security will be a final priority for all participating parties," said its representatives for formula1.com.
He won't send a replacement rider to the Haas race, nor can he.
As the corresponding replacement officer would have to graduate qualifications or rides in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 does not deal with the first raceman.
At the start of the ending season, Covid-19 Kimi Räikkönen, last year, were positively tested by Sergio Perez no Lewis Hamilton.

Honey, silver and 150 diamonds: Price of the most expensive sweater!
It's a little like a portable jewelry, and the creator put his half-year work in it and all his savings.
"I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but a little experience, the sweater never carried much at our house," says Libanon, who spent 3,000 hours over his work for six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carate gold thread in France and 2000 decorative crystals added by Swarowski.
Then he decorated 150 diamonds.
“The foundation is a wave and cotton, but the silk gives the sweater a glimpse,” praises the creator of his work, which, of course, does not recommend laundering.
And it's got another hook.
"I'm totally out of line, I have to sell a sweater as soon as possible," says Libanon.
If it succeeds, it creates a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago was “only ” 720 000 crowns.

The government approved up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Gentiles, researchers and pilots of drones could run before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They should help Polish colleagues to protect the border with Belarus and to build a planned fence.
Poland officially requested assistance from the NATO States, in relation to several months of the ongoing actions of the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of the near-eastern countries in its territory with a false promise to easily cross the EU border.
In the Polish territory, British and Estonian soldiers are already active.
Mutation of Omicron is spreading in the south of Morava?
Hygiena is checking another child's case from Adam's.
“We are currently reported further suspects of this option in another child from Adam's preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from the United States Adamov is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases appeared in the area in the week.
“The official confirmation of the option in our six cases continues to be awaiting – the National Reference Laboratory for Hydrogens and the Hydrogen viruses of the National Health Institute in Prague,” said the Director.
She added that it was two nurses from one workshop of the Faculty Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, along with two 11-year-old U.S. Adamov students.
There is no connection between the cases of Brn and Adam.
Three of them have, according to the director, mild symptoms, four unsignificant progress.
No one with suspicion of Omicron traveled to abroad.
None of those travelled to abroad, none of their families, nor contact anyone who would live abroad.
The compatibility with the championship in the water field has none of those, said Ciupek.
The principal hygienica Paula Svrčina previously stated that an international tournament in the water field was checked in Brno a few weeks ago.
There were also players from the South African Republic and one Belgian player got sick after his return.
California will limit the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas in the ban of abortions.
The governor of California Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday the plan to introduce a ban on sale and production of certain weapons by means of a legal mechanism used by Texas in his controversial law against abortions carried out after detecting a heart attack of the embryo.
Then people would have the right to compensate for anyone in California who manufactures or sells attack guns and a firearms manufactured in California.
The Notice of Newsom responded to the Friday opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, which the Texas ban of abortions remained in force, against the nearly 50-year precedential verdict, which set the right to abortion generally throughout the United States by about 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the Court has now not decided on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical issue that is based on the innovative structure of the measure.
In this case, the ban was transferred to the public, thus the Republicans of Texas disabled its attack by a common judicial way.
"I am upset by the decision of the United States Supreme Court of Justice, which authorized the maintenance of the Texas ban of most abortion services and largely supported the Texas maneuver in order to protect its law," the Californian governor said.
“If States can now block their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives”, continues Newsom.
He said he had authorised his subjects to work on measures that would correct the public's representative to ban attack guns and so-called spirit weapons in cooperation with the State Parliament and the Minister of Justice.
In such a way, they shall be marked as a submarine of manufactured weapons which do not have serial numbers and which may be used to circulate regulations.
Newsom wishes that “private citizens” have the right to require compensation of at least 10,000 dollars (at least 220 000 Kč) and court exhibitions from anyone in California to produce, distribute or sell attack guns, parts to “arms of spirits” or fruits for their production.
"If it is the most effective way to keep these scary weapons outside our streets, to create a threat to private complaints, then we should do exactly that," said the California governor.
The AP acknowledges that after decades, California has banned production and sale of certain arms-style weapons, but in June, the federal judge has blocked this ban as a constitutional.
If the State would now renew the prohibition by using the Texas pattern, the words of the Liberal Member of the Supreme Court of Sonia Sotomayor, which, in an inconsistent opinion on the Friday majority verdict, would be confirmed before the extension of the legal mechanism to other American States.
However, the Supreme Court did not acknowledge a complete immunity against the judicial review and allowed the abortion clinics to continue in complaints on the selected Southern State actors.
Each emergency vaccine has its public test phase when it gradually realizes how the vaccine scheme will look and there is also improvement of the vaccines itself, based on the results.
For example, a 4-dose study has already been studied from Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients have a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has a long-term effect to you.
Just like every other vaccine will have its vaccination scheme after time, just it's too early for it.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, on the basis of an inactive virus, should be marketed shortly, which, according to the manufacturer specifications, promises up to 10 times more efficiency.
The quantity learns to remain calm.

Poland threatened to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would have acted in contrast with the law if it had exploited new powers and stopped the payment of Poland for a legal State.
The Commission has already postponed the adoption of the Polish plan on the drawing of 36 billion euros from the Union Fund for the Renewal of Economies affected by covidu-19.
It is also under pressure from the European Parliament to move on and use a mechanism to retrieve EU grants to countries violating the principles of the legal State.
"Poland should answer this blackmail by the EU vet in all matters that require unanimity," said Ziobro, head of the small part of Solidar Poland, without its votes, the current government would lose the close majority in Seimu.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policies that lead to a drastical increase in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
It would be justified because the EU is illegally deniing funds from the common budget we also contribute to, the Polish Minister added to us.
His party in access to the EU takes more radical attitudes than the Ruling Party of the Right and Justice.
According to the European Commission, the changes by the Polish Justice for the impact of Ziobro have threatened its independence and subject to politics.
Brussels, according to Ziobra, builds “never possible conditions, because its goal is not a legal State, but a change of the government in Poland”.
Warsaw faces “the political dictate conducted by blackmailing and attempting to undermine the democratic decisions of several million Polacians”, also said Ziobro.
He stated that Poland should be a member of the EU which is based on the partnership of sovereign States, not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such resignations to Brussels, which would result in the limitation of Poland's sovereignty.
"We will never agree that Poland has the status of the colony," he said.
But to confess... we have one kind of cheese in Lidl in four different places.
I didn't look at the other things, I've met one yogurt again, I just needed cheese, parmazan, after ten minutes in the milk regals, I've left out and asked.
They had it, that's true, in that narrow sector, all the chosen, less common and special cheese, but it was between vegetables and withoutlactose zone...
If it's going to be avoided, I don't even smell into any market anymore, an action, a gold store on the square, maybe there's no choice, but mostly they have everything I need and it's got some order, so I'm finished in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care.
For two years, I've been watching how it's been dealt with data as a turkey, most of the opponents of the vaccination are just a little more out of the meat than most vaccine vaccines.
While the racial discussions at the professional level are being held, only extreme views are made into the public.
Always from the wall to the wall.
Binary thinking: vaccination will save us, vaccination is for nothing.
To ban everything, to enable everything.
Colour pies instead of solid analysis.
Compare apples with garlics.
This state has it like this, and we have it like this.
But that data collection methodology is different in these two states.
Fuj, that's how I relieved myself.
I'm sorry for the excuse and have a nice day for all of you.
I was punished by cook in my childhood.
It was never because of the marks; mostly it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (which she read instead of going to sleep, beating with her brother, etc.).
At the same time, I've never been punished without a warning, my mom always threatened that if I do it again, I'll get a shot (sometimes even after another "whispering" she just brought the cook and put it down to see it).
Just after I repeatedly refused to listen, I got a few wounds on my ass (through clothes).
I personally think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and measure) are useful because the child responds to them more than words.
It's important to me that the warning part, because it gives the child a choice in a way, whether he will not listen and get, or he'll be better and no punishment.
In the end, I've only had a warning to start listening.
System defence
When a significant Czech lawyer and Constitutional Judge Vojtech Cepl answered a journalist question in 1999, what the Czech Constitution means for it – whether the holy paper, to which he oaths and learns at school, or on the contrary, the agreement that may be changed if necessary, was definitely accompanied by the first concept.
Once in the Constitution, we agreed on the democratic rules of our life, which also define who we are as a State and its citizens, and the changes are better saving.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just like the Czechs like pig and grapes, he voted the question of Vojtech Cepl.
However, recently, the opinion that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes has been increasingly shown among lawyers.
Summers are tested by the situations that her creators (which Vojtech Cepl belonged) could not predict, for example, by behaviour of a directly elected president.
But one thing, Ceple was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interferences in their texts must be considered.
The Constitution should be understood and actively defended, only then it can be the key to dealing with the majority of the crises that companies face through history.
The Constitution is, inter alia, a rule of governance consisting of individual rules which lay down the mantinel policies of the game.
We are afraid that the power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we link policies to bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their power.
Covid doesn't choose, in FN Brno, they're fighting for life of a monthly baby.
Although the coronavirus is milder to children, there are also difficult cases with which hospitals have been dealt most recently.
“We know that children are threatened and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults” said the Newscape Prime Minister of Children's Anesthesiology Clinics and Resuscitation of the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Medical Faculty of Massary University Peter Dominik.
Progress is substantially easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are sick with coronavir, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, there are dozens of children who need mild support care.
It's happening at the child's infectious disease clinic.
Very seriously ill children with coronavir have been on the ARU lately.
Children with postcovid syndromes were continuously at the doctor's section during the whole year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covidal pneumonia, which means a lung inflammation that requires stay on the reconciliation bed," he said and added that this disease interferes with adults and adolescents and a monthly baby.
In hospitals, children are also in a difficult state due to coronavir.
“The child is currently lying with us for several months of adolescent and adolescent," the prime minister said.
Of course, he is happy that no child deaths have been observed at the FN Brno child hospital yet.
According to available data, six children, aged 0 to 14, died on 6 December.
According to Dominica, he is in a child hospital — not only at the coronavir department – a part of the collaboration of the psychologist.
At the same time, he also notes that both in adults and children vaccination mitigates the disease and reduces the occurrence of post-visual syndrome.
“We therefore recommend the vaccination dose in children,” the doctor added.
In a calm zone, you can only walk on the marked roads.
But those calm zones aren't that big.
They are seen on a map of tourist map on maps.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but don't go over the fence to the fence).
Lying/crowing on a bike in the forest outside the marked road shall not be anywhere unless you have any exception (but of course it is not so much watched outside the national parks).
How's the dirigent working?
Music's going in my head, Josef Kurfirst laughs.
He's out of the Liberian opera and originally played the forest corner.
As a singer, he can sing almost all the repertoire and as a dirigent acts not only in the Liberian Theatre F. Shalda but also in Plzni, in the Theatre of Joseph Kayetan Tyl.
He cooperates with castle filharmonia, film filharmony or sub-symphony orchestra.
China builds the impression of contaminated diseases and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Synologist Jiroush: China is building the impression of contaminated infections and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China went to medical and political injury.
A few months ago, Peking reflected his criticism for not being able to stop the infection that turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country reports a zero increase in the infected.
States including Czech competition on Chinese protective aids and Chinese doctors are helping many in fighting coronavir, for example in the worst affected Italy.
How do you feel Peking's willingness?
Is it friendly or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend of a friend and he says, "Hey, you don't want a elephant?
I got him, and he's great.
The wife loves it because she saves the grass, the car washs the hobots, the kids play with it.
Well, it's just great.
If you want for 5,000, I'll sell your elephant.
All right, let's screw it up, it'll be great...
After some time they meet, and the one who bought complains: Dude, what did you sell for the elephant?????
The grass crushed, the giant shit everywhere, the car spread, the kids are afraid of him, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The guy who sold says, "You're talking bad about elephant, you don't sell a elephant like this."
The world's action is controlled by powers.
Although the equality of the sovereign States is valid, they are the powers that determine the course of international action.
Europe can only become such power if it is working on its integration.
It is currently working at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but there is still no military integration.
I personally think Europe is heading for federalization.
It won't be 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the mid-century, moods will be different, and it will work.
I thought, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not a Czech expert, so maybe I'm a speaker.
I'm just saying that the elipse mostly includes two different units at the same level.
I will take an example from another commentary of "Spain Orange and Mandarin", when it is clear that both of Spain, whereas "Spain fruit and mandarin" are not clear with the mandarins that they are from Spain.
Besides, I'm based on the fact that the sentence is "all American forces" that includes their weapons and that I know that the American complexes are operational only by the Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in this broad concept and it is not necessary to specify it in American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying "D"
Whether it is, whether or not, it's an impetuous requirement.
The earthquake of five degrees has been recorded in Tokyo.
The Japanese Metropoli Tokio and the surrounding areas affected the earthquake of 5.0 degrees on Sunday.
The Witnesses stated that buildings were trembling in the capital, but no damage has yet been reported.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortured a monkey of Space Milly
The scary recordings show the moment the scared monkey cried in the toilet meat before her insensitive owner screwed her and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkey was also feeding cottons, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of its real nutrition needs.
The Magistrate Court in Gwent now forbid her for life, informed the Sun.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who take care of Milly after her torture have declared that they have never seen such a frightened spaceman.
Milly spent almost two years rehabilitation with Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now she is happy again playing with another saved monkey named Moon.
Four times the mother confessed to two accusations of the cause of unnecessary suffering to protected animal.
At the magistrate court in Gwent, she was sentenced 12-week penalty of abduction of liberty with a conditional delay for one year.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a life-time ban on animal behaviour and has to pay 12,000 crowns of judicial costs.
The chief of the Small Monkeys team, who rehabed the animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is okay, but rehabilitation will continue.”
Milly took time to get used to people again.
She cried and hid from everyone she met and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she's settled and satisfied with a male, she can still cause panic in her view of new people.
Psychical scars from the harassment will be carried out forever, Sawyer delivers.
Milly's tissue came out after the police in Gwent discovered scary recordings in her wife's phone after the crash in her apartment for drug charges.
You can hear Milly's vulgarity in the videos.
In the next video, the Holland monkey offers cocaine and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
So lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox (43) confessed to hold cocaine with intention to sell it.
In her house, cocaine was found for 1600 pounds (a number of less than 50 000 crowns) hidden in the Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was sentenced for 20 months.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from that line three times after yourself when you courageously skip the 20th century?
How about you take the same things as in the sixth grade?
And all of this kills the idea of bifling when no one, honour of exceptions, cares if you can or understand.
Just write a test to 1 and then nobody cares about it.
Go and on the street randomly people ask if you can determine the nature of the roots of the square equations and factors.
Everyone's been through it, and the absolute majority doesn't even scratch and tell you they're totally in their face.
So what the fuck's he learning about?
I'm a big fan of the general review and the fact is that people don't want and don't need it.
And at that point, it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
It's partly taught for many people who'll need this thing.
But, like, the note that you don't really need this, I meant really... because you just don't need it.
Furthermore, we're getting slowly till we don't know is a punk mark.
(Which is likely participating in our communist past and agitation against educational and elitics) However, the price of barbars standing in those machines is just high.
If journalists were able to count, there's probably never been such dimensions here.
Wedding at first sight: War of Kadrie and Andrey continues!
Which is the main reason Switzerland can't leave right now," Andrea answered at the Instagram in Stories to the universal questions of curious fans, which disappointed her at Kadrim so that she decided to end all contacts and even block it on social networks.
Between Kadrim and Andrea, it's been scratched since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland, and his idea was that Andrea would move to her, so at least until he returned to Czech Republic.
But she definitely rejected it.
And as it appears, their relationship did not only end with love but rather grow into mutual disrespect to hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he was upset with the turn of Kadri in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling and debts.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri's ex-wife has not liked his younger sister, Linda.
She decided to stop her brother publicly.
Normally, I don't speak to such things at all, and even in the family, we've never said these things very extra.
I definitely don't want to make any regret.
But when I see someone who's trying to hurt publicly and dirty the name of someone I love so much, he just won't give me it!
I'm sorry I have to do this this way, but I'd like to thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most, even at how young he was.
I'm more sorry for that when I have to read this incorrect information that is probably quite out of context.
I would awfully wish to all know Kadri, just like I, our neighbours and our family, stand in a confession to Andrey's words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all and know the fact and we know what it really was, she added uncertainly.
The drunk thief climbed up on the fifth floor.
You won't believe what.
He started his robbery trip by Cchao at the parking lot in a residential neighborhood where he tried to get into a few cars.
According to the available information, he eventually departed from one vehicle in the number of less than 330 crowns.
Then he had no better idea than climbing up to the 5th floor and entering the apartment with an open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
On one security camera, he's caught walking the street away from the crime scene and eating a banana.
When the apartment owner woke up in the morning, he found out that bananas weren't where they were, and called the police.
The Cchaa's subsequently held.
The man confessed that he drank some alcohol on an incriminated day.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob drunk.
The whole thing is still in the investigation.
The drunk climbed down the fasada to the fifth floor where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is timely limited and effectively linked to pandemic urgency.
If it's cancelled, the law will not be effective.
While the law limits the scope of business
Isn't that a reason enough for you?
The right to gather will be limited, but not cancelled.

What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign policy?
I think all this people write here you know well.
You're just playing a fool so you can "speak."
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything.
I even like a lot of church buildings from aesthetic view (and the goal was to look well).
And I don't care who believes in.
On the other hand, I don't care how much the church had power in the Middle Ages, how much money she's accumulated, the oppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars that it has caused, for example, the 30-year-olds.
Tl;dr: believe yourself in a spaghetti monster, but the state and church have nothing to do together.
The man fell his head down 12 meters.
He survived the concrete attack.
The unbelievable fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, who was involved in the district healthcare rescue service.
The employees of the Circuit Operation Centre took over an hour after Saturday midnight the press call with initial information on the fall of a man from the height.
Two ZZS crews — medical and healthcare immediately took place.
After arriving in the place, the doctors found that a seventeen - year - old man was supposed to fall out of the window of the height of about twelve meters and catch his head on the concrete!
There's coal in Vietkovic.
But not the way it should be, and the firemen went to action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, a man was unconscious, with numerous injuries and in a direct danger of life.
The intervening physician intimidated his breathing paths, secured artificial lung ventilation and after other measures under pre-health immediate care, his sanitation vehicle transferred to the further care of the island traumatological centre, the speaker ZZS MS region, Lukas Humpl.
Greater concerns than the coronavir I have from the inadequate responses of the public and the authorities
Enlargement of coronavir in Czech Republic means a challenge for politicians and officials, in the first line of fight against disease, but primarily for doctors and health personnel.
How serious is the situation from their perspective?
We're asking David's military doctor.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a great galavecher full of interesting results.
Because things were happening at UFC 269 tournament.
Outsider Julianna Penya was able to defeat the legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found a murderer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira didn't hesitate in light weight, bring a great scratch against Dustin Poirier and defend the belt.
He also recorded the victory of Kai Kara-France, who quickly ruined Cody Garbrandt's Technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also beat his rival.
Surprise that no one was expecting.
This was brought by a woman's bantam game between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Penya.
The American woman joined the battle of each other as an intelligent “package, ” because Nunes did not lose for seven years and push her teeth to another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes launched the triumph of victory very actively, and the rival even saved the push kick to send her to the ground.
However, the monetary did not make any other mistakes, and she failed to attack herself using a hand-to-handed pack.
The second bike was scratching and for MMA fans was very stressful.
Both rivals administered a lot of excellent hits and hard hooks.
In addition, Nunes got her on the ground where she started scratching her.
She had to give up the attempts and strike away.
That's how the American made everyone a huge shock when she became a new champion.
The top of the galavecher was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier on the title in light weight.
At first, although Poirier had better worked, the card began to turn.
In that second, he tried to be more active than Oliveira, who tried to hit the rival with a hand.
Although he didn’t get too well, he then made a big pressure, got a rival on his back and spilled him with a number of wounds.
That's why he won the second round.
In the third circle, Oliveira showed the rear naked choke, whom Poirier resisted for a while, but then he had to scratch away.
Brazilian so defended the title, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, he wrote the sovereign triumph Sean O'Malley, who already put on Raulian Paiva the hard right back in the first round.
Then he got a number of exact hits and recorded the fifteenth triumph.
Then Kara-France managed to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
On spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with a little daughter, and now she lost after seven years.
The pinch or the pinch?
At first, it's nothing complicated.
Most of the significant names in Czech are only one grammatic family, and there is no problem to determine whether it is a male, female or middle.
But then there is also a relatively numerous group of substantial names in which the family is not steady.
Such substantial names collapse between two families.
Then two ends are accommodated and, in some cases, they remain in an inclined form.
For example, the words “whispered ” or“ pearl ” are men and women, in which the first slope is scrolled according to the model “song, ” in the second, according to the pattern of “song. ”
For another group of substantial names, different forms are already in the first fall of a single number, such as ‘line/reduction’, ‘cacluben/cottlub’ or ‘potatoe/potato’ (in the meaning of food).
Both forms are written, they have the same meaning, and therefore they are freely replaceable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, such as the “corn” in the Czech Republic and the“coats” in Morava, but in this case, the Moravian variant is unspeakable, similarly, there are other Czech and Moravian pairs of words: “shoot” and “shook”, “cook” and “cooks” etc.
Some words that came into Czech from other languages were originally inclined, but gradually accepted the Czech ends.
A typical example is the term “image ” that is a male and female, or the word“ buffet ” that remains in the middle of the family, but has the ends according to the pattern “clock. ”
Turkey opened a path for migrants to Europe.
What's the situation right on the Greek borders?
The Greek and Turkish border is in tension because of the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people began to be issued to the south of the Schengen space after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise Greece's support, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian assistance.
What motivates refugees to the uncertain path?
And what's the situation right in place?
We haven't seen blue sky for three months, and we've been choking, describing Sydney's journalist
The ruining fires with which Australia has been encountered for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozens of people and hundreds of millions of animals and destroyed millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the inhabitants of the country collapse?
Could the government of Prime Minister Morrison do more to prevent the drastic impacts, as criticians say?
And what will the country in relation to climate change have to prepare for the future?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to Sydney's journalist Ika Detrich.
Fake accusations were always and are rare enough.
That's why everyone always writes about.
It's uncomfortable for people to decide how sexual violence looks in our society and how extensive it is, so he's trying to order it.
I don't know anyone personally who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who were raped and I experienced how many of these people are treated by their surroundings or even the police.
The victims should always believe.
Trends have finally opened victims about their traumas.
But he still keeps too many people for himself.
Yes, they will find some who will blame someone fakely.
It's disgusting and spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the thought that "a great part of the accusation is made up" and that it's "trand" you're only helping sexual abusers.
Czech Republic floods the buildings, families don't have money to finish
Construction prices have increased by more than 30 per cent in the past weeks and months.
A number of people have gotten into a traumatic situation.
Because she has no funds for the completion of the established family homes and banks refuse to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the prices of the material, the price of construction work is also increased.
That's why people don't have enough money to finish the already established family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely uncomfortable situation.
In a better case, people move to the homes that are built and unchooled.
In a worse case, building houses are unused and families are forced to sell them because they can't afford to pay mortgages and still pay rentals," says BHS Economy Stephan Krček.
We'll build two to three family houses in a year, and 50 percent of us have happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it's hard to keep some things contractually, even though the material is betrayed.
So we do no money," said the owner of the Building Company Zednek Slivoň.
Many people will only have financial problems.
If they're counting on building the house is going to be five million, now it's gonna be seven.
I think some will wait," Slyvon added.
The material was most irritated by copper, iron, and installatory and topenary equipment.
Building companies are also fighting the lack of working forces.
In Czech Republic there are no graduates in construction areas, and the influx of foreign workers hampers pandemia.
It is only more favourable at this time for the issue of construction authorisation.
“Building authorities issued 7 675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” Krec said.
We're fine and we'll get better.
Real vision but missing, says the CRO commentator – MujRoslas
The entry into the new year, except for classical celebration, has been traditionally carried out by politics.
This year, other than the Prime Minister and President of ANO Andrea Babisha and the Christmas message of President Milos Zeman and the Presidents of the Senate and the Assembly of the Ambassador.
What is the essential thing we learned?
I've got a great degree in this, I've got my own theme I've chosen, I've been on the bachelor, I've always been working on it for a year, and then in a week to two, I'll write a written part.
The states are totally calm in our house, if you're not a total makac, and there's something left in his head, then the committee won't suppress him for use in the theory.
I may have been studying at the statistics a week, and when I was at the end, the committee was always trying to get me into some logical ride that I had right, and I had it.
Otherwise, I know people who will pay someone to do this semestral project to them (we've done it many times, really benefitable, they'll learn a lot) and then they'll just learn the project and they're getting older.
I think it's great when at the end of the subject there's a test in which the knowledge acquired within the project, not just defense.
All right, but don't swallow e-mails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be the same dick as they are.
These people in the embassy don't have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they'd take a lot of risks, so maybe they'd have to play with them because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can just build a statue like Putin next to the statue of the Bear Pue.
You should still put it on Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing a stick to the artists under his feet.
Once you don't give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reaches are reduced to a complete minimum.
Furthermore, it still changes which function is more important if the liquor, comment or storage.
I'm sick lately, so maybe I'm going to have to get down to tictock where many artists in my business are successful and they're not gonna let that happen.
Eventually, I might like to see if there's something that's more useful than the artist's creativity and energy.
Statement of the Parties working on Donbase
The Union – yes, breaking – no, expresses their views on the picture of opponents of the breakdown of the SSSR.
Thirty years since the illicit breakdown of the SSSR.
On December 8, 1991, the biggest geopolitical disaster in human history.
In the White Tower forest on 8 December 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravčuk and Stanislav Šuškevic, without any legal power and violating the results of the referendum of 17 March 1991, with an open convenient position of Michael S. Gorbačov, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that “The SSR bond as an entity of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist”.
One crush of the pen was “restrained ” by an enormous land with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
A decades of millions of ethnic Russian citizens have fallen apart from abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has decreased by 10 to 11 million.
Despite the loss of the Nerusian population of former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars together!
Even earlier, the same people who destroyed what was built in the White Tower Forest during the past seventy years have betrayed the socialist camp (formed by the price of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotical War).
They have done deindustrialization, inhibited agriculture, removed from the largest world power of 14 republics, which have previously been economically connected into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the poverty of the population, the decline in the economy, science, army, the growth of crime, the interethnic conflict, the war in Chechen, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the diversion of Yugoslavia, the Arab spring, the war in Syria -- all this is the result of geopolitic капitulation, the first socialist camp, and then the Soviet Union.
There is a concept in politology like “vacuum of power”.
Everything that was betrayed and gave up quickly filled up and conquered NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical капitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken mostly from the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
The price of the product sold in a supermarket with a large reverse must not correspond directly to its quality and quality.
It's Monday and we've got some meat in the supermarket that cost 189 Kč/kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the refrigerator and making it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality in which I can't buy this meat on Monday, it will be declined to 99 Kč/kg on Tuesday - will you describe me a mechanism that will make the meat change of its prices the burden for my experience system?
And if I wait until Thursday and that meat is 1 day before the consumption date will be cheap to 69 Kč/kg - what would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday about 120 Kč and left it three days in my refrigerator?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
These shit about that when something's cheap, it must be guaranteed bad, corrupt or unquality are so retarded to tell you the truth;-)
I went to Brna to Headas recently, and in the floor, the lady gave some brochure, I always take things like that to help the brigs, they can't fire it...
Well, the brochure was full of rural minds and conservative views of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I thought it would be such an agitation.
After reading, I found who was publishing it, and the scientology finally came out of it.
Well, like a good motherfucker, full of absolutely unnecessary lessons, as I should be washing and not being a pizza.
The damage to the paper, that's why the forests wouldn't have to go.
I've experienced something like this with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychical manipulation and emotional extortion will make you do it because you love it without realizing how much it is in the situation.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment early, she cried and asked me not to go anywhere on her knee.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
A year ago, it was a great relationship, but then it ran another six months and started kicking her on the stick.
Then I ended this relationship with what I told her I broke up and lied to her, but we could talk about it next week to calm her down and not catch some ammon.
Such a person is sucking out of you emotions, emotions, and total joy.
You'd rather keep a distance
When insurances are sneaking up here by shopping a cloud of tests and hurrying to a positive one who wouldn't even know about that terrible disease.
The only thing we're reaching is the complications for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in a random number generator fell five days of home prison.
In the west, they stopped with the championship and recognized that it was not worth dealing with the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, War is a new one, and he has to steal something else and drive his ego invention of bullshit.
I'm seeing a good old asshole's coming back.
After several years of collapse and suppression of this kind of business, MLM recruitment is returned to an exemption.
I was one of the recruitors, I tried it (I was 20 years old, first-year-old to the VS), the initial promises of learning products and trade skills quickly turned into "that doesn't matter you, mainly get people."
I was sincerely interested in the products I offered, since I wanted to help people, however, training was rather about how to scare and talk.
When the first earned money came, a person quickly realized that if he wants to make money, he has to flip a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable, or the man felt like a loop salesman.
But what I can say, it was a valuable experience, a person learned that it should not jump at once on every peak and information thoroughly.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw everyone in the same bag.
People in this business are successful and even benefitable to people, but they will certainly not be praised by expensive consumption or "free" account.
In the corporate where I do, I haven't experienced much of that.
HR is calm, the managers are looking at their managership and they don't push us much into anything.
The regular evaluation is happening somehow, in the form that this goes pretty well with us (set some targets for the next year, we'll see what's done and what's not) - it's rather self-esteem than someone to evaluate you according to some numbers, and so on.
Company actions are also unnecessary.
But even within our company, we are a little unique - they're divisions that are more corporate.
Sometimes a person feels like we're such a almost-startup that squats in the offices of the great corporate no.
But it doesn't work that way that we don't get so bothered as long as there are results.
Czech Republic missing in Britain is dead.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days the British police looked for the missing 32 - year - old Czech Republic that was lost in the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12th, the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in the demision of Jacob Kulhanek on social networks that the woman from UHERSK was found dead.
This afternoon, the British police confirmed our representative office in London, unfortunately, that she found the body of missing Czech citizens.
The cause of death is investigated.
In view of the family, we will not communicate more information on the case.
Honestly, he stated on Twitter Culhanek.
The young woman was last seen on November 28th in the bus on her way from work, and she was supposed to pick up the money from the bankomate before the show.
Her disappearance was announced by a colleague from work five days later.
Then the london police began searching for it, and Interpol included it among the missing around the world.
So it appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
The police have arrested a man in this connection a few days ago.
What he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspected, but didn't publish.

The processing of the results of the Saturday elections symbolically concludes a relatively difficult, but successful year for us.
There have been four new or repeated elections to the general representatives and, in particular, very monitored elections to the House of Justice.
We had to work mostly in more difficult epidemic conditions, which have given greater access to equipment and personnel security, Eva Crump, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistics Office.
Last election district was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49 hours.
On Monday the vote results will be discussed by the State Election Commission and will be published in the Law Collection after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
It took me a very dangerous infectious illness at the beginning of the whole time, but it went without bigger disturbances.
I'm dealing with how an idiotic part of the population gets into it on all its layers, so far, I have a problem with it.
I look forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because it finally makes me less dependent on the fact that other people are not shit.
He would be freed from the president's office and the eligibility to re-establish it.
The chance that this really happens is how others mention very small here.
Besides, I'm not sure if the record's records could be regarded as an excellence.
Velezrada is an act that the President of the Republic threatens the supremeness, territorial integrity, or the democratic nature of the State.
It must have been something more serious.
How pandemia has affected intimate life: The number of people growing up to 35 years old, who are with no sex all year
The more young adults in the United States live their lives without sex.
It is mainly about religiously founded people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the share of people under 35 who renounce sexual life increased from eight to 21 percent.
Women between 18 and 35, which indicated that they had no sex in the last year, were more than ever before.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, showed an examination of the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them may be the economic impact of coronavir pandemia and a higher percentage of unemployment.
But it could also contribute to the presence of media, social networks or video games that make sex smaller and less priority for young people.
"From 2010, the share of men and women between 18 and 35 years has grown rapidly," the researcher IFS Lyman Stone said.
In married people, sexual activity is more frequent, and only 5% of them said they were in the last year without sex.
It was 29% for free people. Stone added that marriage under 35 years is only a small percentage.
Sexual activity also contributes to the fear of pre-marriage and religious establishment.
Although more likely for husbands to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married 35 years still declines.
Young people share the view of pre-married sex, about 30% thinks it's a bad thing, while approximately 70% thinks he's okay.
"It is true that among the free individuals in this age group are a minority, but their behavior moves this trend," Stone says about these thirty percent.
Most of those who have a moral problem with pre-marriage is the cause of a religious foundation.
Since 2008, the ratio of abstinence increased from 20 to almost 60% in free people under 35 years of age, who attended religious meetings more than once a month.
The trend has been raised from 10 to 20% among the “minor believers”," Stone said.
Other factors, such as less social interactions and particularly social alcohol drinking during pandemic, also contribute to the decline in sexual activity.
The study also showed that the probability of sex is smaller in people without work or with lower income.
Another reason can be the extension of digital media that apparently reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, making this need "replaced".
This trend was captured mainly as a lockdown during the pandemic of coronavir.
The whole vaccination order against covid is whether the company should force a part of the population to be conducted that they do not want but which can save their lives.
It's a rather difficult question that I personally care about the issue of social conscience.
For example, if we don't order them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could definitely have been able to do the death of an eighty-year-old man who really didn't know much, we didn't explain it well, he heard some dezinformation, and he didn't succeed and finally caught it and died.
On the other hand, I don't think we're going to be in the death of a strong vaccine opponent who's crying on the side of the SPD and the KSCH.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most unexpected pensioners are probably part of the second group, so they will actually be able to do so alone.
Czech Republic without snow.
How is mild cold signed on the fight against drought?
This year's cold has brought one of the smallest snow suits for the last time in Czech Republic.
The ski operators will not go through without technical snow, weather may also complicate the preparation of the Running Jizerian 50s.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will a little snow mean for the fight against the drought in the Czech Republic?
I'd have a story, but it's not about a pancake.
Once in high school, the teacher led us across the city to the shipway so that we could ride the boats across the river.
On the road, we went one of these pretty broad streets, and we probably don't see in the middle -- the sect sect of Hare Krishna.
Of course they've gone on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but with one friend they talked.
When she left them, we asked her and her teacher what she told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she answered.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the boathouse.
We're so spoiled.
It doesn't happen so much, but the system's falling down, says Orozovič.
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after his previous visits to Paris and Brussels, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday, where Prime Minister Mateus Moravecki welcomed him with military honour.
"We open a new chapter of mutual relations," Moravecki said at the joint press conference after the negotiation.
Scholz emphasized that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violations of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
The crisis, caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian borders, is, according to the chancellor, critical to deal with the use of diplomatic negotiations, including in the “normandian group”, which is associating France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Moravecki stated that he informed the Officer of the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexandr Lukašenko artificially caused the migration crisis and used people as live targets and guns, because at night we record hundreds of attempts on (illegitimate) crossing the borders.
The chancellor has dealt with other sanctions to finally understand that we are determined to defend the Eastern EU border.
Scholz, according to the DPA agency, assured that Varsawa was looking forward to the German support in conflict with Belarus, and condemned the non-human treatment of the Lukašenk regime with the run.
The drunk Polish barrel blamed the accident, tried to hide it.
After a while the car returned to the scene of the accident, the car was driving another nun who tried to take guilt on himself.
When she was told by the police that she could lose a driver's license when she did not give her the advantage in the ride and distraction from the scene of the accident, she went out with the truth, TVN24 said.
She admitted that another nun who asked her to help was hit the vehicle.
Then the cops came to pick up Sister Celestine.
She was subjected to breath tests, and after she discovered that she had over two miles in her blood, she was immediately taken from her driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that she would confess from her actions in court.
The dog Hugo is doing what he can.
Juraj Shimovič didn't watch his movie.
Czech family comedy creators looked at American stories about love dogs.
But they forgot about the important thing: the lawfulness of the film work.
After the F. Brabce Gump film, the dog that taught people to live is now missing another picture in the movies.
The script-autor and director in one person Juraj Shajmovič ml. freely relapses to his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
On the scene, the speaking linger Hugo and some famous figures around him are coming back.
Julia and Ivan, the owners of the woods pension that's shattering, and so they start to invite dogs, Julia's father with her partner and her daughter Veronica.
She's not a little girl anymore, but a teenage girl who experiences the first love.
The director with Beatriz Shajmovic partner (which is also a film producer) had been facing the history procedures in the previous dog's picture, but at least children and dogs had fun there.
This time, she wrote a creative couple a weaker scenario that causes the mixture of awesomeness and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's take a summary.
Julia, though a scientist, is in the desire of a child's dark fornication and if the right “constellation” comes, fills with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are currently determined – on the car or church tower (of course during the excursion with the local guide), the colonel Mohmir, despite the summer training, will shoot in the woods of his own daughter (Julia), which falls into a coma, and the family is taken from the hospital to play a miraculous dog healing process in the heart of the noise loose.
Nothing against clean treatment of nature and the strength of animal loves.
Their owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is amazing what content pellel full of incredible situations and figure was necessary for this message.
Two staff thieves, peasant competition, woodish charlatan, cops arriving to look for "drogs" and discussing herbs about the fertile bone flour strength – and which the baked family in the pension of the opio.
When a hero wakes up after a heavy coma and sits in front of her, she's sitting ondoled and drawn with a cigarette at the family table and requires the father's whiskey and flakes as a healed vegetarian, she can't laugh.
The creator will explain to the audience that “this sometimes happens after a coma. ”
Shimovich's team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of text work, the ability to develop the nose situation, the feelings for characters of figures and the point and direct management.
The actress are unbalanced, the cut unhelpless and the overall impression.
Anyway, Lucas Vaculik, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boud is trying to stop her party, they have nothing to play.
The only feature of the film remains the poetic recordings of the forest nature of the cameraman Vladimir Holomk and a couple of pokers.
It is not enough to plan a few figures, a household confusion and dog rumors, with more human vulgarian expressions that the figures make.
Argument is not even summer membership in the River Club - as in the case of the producer.
A good intention to promote the nature and friendship of a dog with a dog must also be the knowledge of the work if a person wants to tell a confidential story.
That failed in this case.
There's a little too much erotic for a good family picture and a minimum feeling for the genre.
Even as a canisterapia advertisement, this amateur-whispered piece wouldn't pass.
Yeah, respect, 'cause they have to listen to constant obsessions just from idiots like you.
There's a difference between offering and force, here's how much shit you understand, but it's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always on the customer, if he doesn't want it, the answer will always be no.
If you were still listening to such kids, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in the case of a brig.
The near east suffers unusually dry months.
The winter is the only period in the year it rains.
"As well as the complete absence of crashes during November, as we recorded in certain stations, is unusual," the Israeli meteorological service confirms.
For example, the Kfar Giladi village in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long - term disturbance average in November.
Therefore, the two-day rain this week was rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't been raining for a long time.
It's also the right Christmas culiss, rejoiced the inhabitants of Nazaret Vasim Ashkar.
The winter moons are solely in Israel, inciting and irregular.
There are dependent forests on the winter rain.
Without them they are drying and inclined to fires.
It's not only forests, it's also the supply of drinking water and the surgery for farmers.
The largest sweetwater source in Israel, the Galilean Lake, was filled on the spring this year by three last rain winters.
Since then, the level has fallen down.
The aquacultures have warned about drying long ago.
“It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be disturbance”, the Israeli spokesman for Water Economy Uri Schor assumed in 2018.
Israel can help technologies such as solving or recycling of waste waters.
It is worse for economically weak countries like Libanon, Syria, or Jordan.
In the streets of Jordan, Ammanna, accompanied by tank cars.
The waterwaters and private wells dry.
"This summer has raised my orders by 70 to 80 percent compared to two previous years," Imad Sulejman said in September.
In Iranian Isfahan, conflicts between farmers and security forces broke.
The reason for the protest was dry.
The local River Corrito was completely out of water.
The region has the driest November in many recent years.
Israel Prepares Military Intrusion against Iran
The Israeli Defence Minister declared that the negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and informed Washington about the preparations of the attack on Iranian nuclear equipment.
Minister Benny Gantz announced on Saturday that he ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military attack against Iran, Jonathan Lis informed.
Gantz, who stays in the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to put their pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about military preparations.
During the press conference in Florida Gantz said that nuclear negotiations in Vienna did not bring “no progress” and the world powers“ understand that the Iranians are playing with them. ”
It happened to me about three years ago.
I screwed up a little bit and grilled in the interview to find out what she really wants to do with me.
Finally, I found out that my suspicion of pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these frauds, so I've got a little bit of doubt and questions and I finally thanked you and left.
You can tell me I've been screwed up, but pyramida is a pyramid, and financial advisors are financial advisors.
The skiers went to the mountains, waiting for enough snow and nice weather.
The Mountain Centre in Czech Republic experienced the first larger effort of skiing students on this weekend.
After an excellent snowing at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow, and some skiareals have started operation.
The Congressors did not defeat either the obligation to show themselves in the trains with covid certificates.
While the invaders do not complain about the interest of customers, some ski equipment loans a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people in the Liberian district traveled to the railway tracks and to the conventions.
The skiers wanted weather that offered the sun today and the excellent snow conditions.
"We are satisfied, the starting weekend really came from the Friday night skiing when we had the first skier on the hill," the director of the Sport Area, Šed Jacob Hanush, commended.
Thousands of people went to the first weekend skiing in the new season, too, to the Jesenics.
For example, they had ski Aren Karlov or the centre in Branna in Schumpersk.
The weekend visit was very pleasant, and 400 people were estimated on Saturday and today.
Conditions are super.
Today the sunlight was lighting, about minus three degrees, so perfect, did not save the praise representative of the ski center in Branna Rostislav Walk.
Skyareal operators can only sell skipas to people who are vaccinated or are within a period of time after covid-19 disease.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared and demonstrated the necessary documents, CTK René Groneš said from the Spindler Mlyn sciccentre.
"We only recorded incident units," he added.
Less interest than some loans and ski equipment are reported before the pandemic.
Fortunately, the interest in leasing skies is.
It's not like the past years, but there's still plenty of customers, Alexandra Bokishová said from the Skiopava Shopping Store.
He expects greater effort during the ski courses.
The director of the Royal Court of Justice, Snowbear David Shintak, also feels that the covid is not about lending ski equipment as before.
At that time, we were nearly borrowed before the pandemic.
In contrast to the period before the pandemic, we are approximately 50 percent, said CTK Shintak.
He said that people were lazy with pandemia and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand records the loan in the Novako area on God’s gift.
They started the ski borrowing there a week ago, and the stakeholders now have to order them in advance.
"We're starting to borrow this weekend, but people have already called forward, so we expect a great interest, just like last year," said the Operator of the Area of Pavlina Novak.
The interest compared to the period before the epidemic is also according to the ski school.
If we want successful and rich not to go abroad, there must be a chance to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialistic health care, where it is often not possible to acquire dentists or doctors of a specialist.
They're going to abroad with smart and fine people who don't have any property here.
The owner of the company really won't go to abroad.
But it's totally agreeing with the rest.
If these people don't live well in the C.R. and if these people don't have a sight of a reasonable future in the C.R., they just won't live in the C.R.
Immigration from Hungary began by winning Orban one beautiful day, a year ruled, and suddenly a few dozen thousand emigration rose.
It is naive to think that the ČR can not find itself in a similar position from day to day.
Another question are choices at all.
If you live stupidly here, there's a traditional V4 mad man here too.
Young people and education will leave, his supporters will remain, and the people whose property can't be put into the plane.
Scary photo!
Langmaier in blood for a beer beer?
While in the Czech Republic there was a full-flow autumn, in Thailand, he used tropical weather to take the head of the island film with Jiri Langmaier (55)!
The actress published a bleeding photo of faces on social networks.
Is it a real wound, or is it about the processing for the recording?
The London Police are still looking for the unfair Czech Republic.
She was last seen on her way home.
"The disappearance of Petry is not like her behaviour and we are starting to worry about her," said Lucy O'Connor in the Saturday video from the police department in Lambeth, where Srcová worked.
"Her family in the Czech Republic also has great concerns about her and just wants to know where she is," she continued.
The missing Czech Republic according to her on Sunday 28 November around 19:45 left work and headed home to Camberwell's quarter.
The last time she was seen in the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3rd.
According to British media, the Srnc worked as a “care sister” in the child's hospital Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to Guy's and St. Thomas's hospital.
"We have tremendous concerns about our dear colleague Peter, who is unreasonable," said a healthcare group in Twitter's contribution.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help her find to contact the police," the communication continued.
The public to cooperate also calls on Ambassador Harriet Harman, who noted on Saturday at the press conference.
"She's missing for a few days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried about death," the labourist politics said, holding a woman's photograph distributed by the London police in her hand.
"I feel that we all have particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was out of her homeland, away from her family and worked here for our health," Harman said.
The police have already arrested a man who remains in custody in the case.
According to the BBC reporting website, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what a man is suspected of.
Russia is unable to hire Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. ca 5 divisions).
That's not how I underestimate Ukraine.
It's not an enormous quantity, it's about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine repeats that we increase the threat of the Invasion and begin to have our entry full of teeth.
I quoted upstairs.
I don't know what he thought Russia wanted the war.
The war is a damn dear joke and Russia has a GDP of Italy.
The comparison of situations in 38 is out in so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare it to the first punk war and "anexi" sicilia :D
I can imagine that, after Ukraine announced that she would not comply with the agreements from Minsk, Russia is accompanied by those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and the "concentration" on the borders would answer that.
That, the pact of the Sunt Servand...
In Prague, new driving orders have been applied since Sunday, mainly affected by corporal connections
The travellers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) expects several changes from Sunday, which are particularly related to the suburb connections.
There were new lines, some changed the route, and others disappeared.
The integrated system is newly involved in Mladoleslavia.
In the capital of Sunday, they stop rapids from Czech Budjejevic at the Garden City Station.
In the suburb trains, S7, trains traveling on the road from Beroun to the Czech ship by the Prague main station.
In the recently operated Prague-Grade station, the R17 speed will be stopped from the Czech Budjejevic and Beness.
The PID is newly expanded into other areas.
Otherwise, they will drive buses to the Light of Sazawa, Blatna at Jesenica, Old Floods and Turnov.
Buses will be included in Mladoboleslavia, including lines with crossing to Liberian and the King's Garden.
Incorporating 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines are introduced and 12 functional operations will be adjusted.
From Prague Zlichin, a new bus line 405, which will go to Jatca.
There was also a new direct connection to Prague – Kralovica in the Cancer, which replaces the cancelled train line S53.
They will be empowered in the morning peak, and on the weekend they will connect from Prague to Cancer, when the new express line number 404.
The new PID system includes 400 and 410 lines traveling to the Liberian District.
They're coming from the metro station, not from the Holešovic Station.
Friday line 400 goes through Mulder, Duba and Czech Lepa to New Bor, and the chosen mergers continue to Rumburg or Cvikova.
The 410 additional line travels through Majornik and Dubua to Docs, Mimona and Jablonny in Podešted.
On the contrary, the new operation in the tens of Central Czech local tracks is cancelled or limited, including to Mochov, Dobris or Rožmital under Tremshin.
All trains to leave Prague are cancelled at 2:30.
Because of modernisation, the railway continues with long-term restrictions on the trails of Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysaa over Labe and the area of Kolina.
Changes wait for passengers in other places.
The buses are replaced by certain cancelled railway lines or extended on line 420 of Dobris with a proportion from Prague where the PID tickets can be used to Milevska.
A change has been experienced by lines 540 to 543 in Nimburg, and some buses are adjusted on the border of Central Czech and Horjewicka in the Plzeny region.
Healthy meal/ lunch to the supermarket office
Hey, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30-min break and my only chance to get food is to go to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, I have no power to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietally as possible.
Unfortunately, I don't know what to buy, and I'll buy pizza pizza at the speed and for yogurt and apple.
Question: What healthy without the need of heat adjustment would you recommend to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone's waiting for a meter of snow like you, unfortunately.
And it's not about trees you need to see.
Under the snow only a peak of tree can be hiding.
If it falls down, the tree may be more inclined to mushroom diseases.
I'm not saying that that's the only reason we're not allowed to ride outside the convention, but it's one of them.
Dary's confession about the relationship with the bear: I haven't been happy for this
The Czech show business pond since Friday is nothing but revealing the relationship of Dary Rolins and Paul Ned.
They've been pulling it together in the past summer, the famous footballist even got divorced because of the singer.
Now Dara sent a massive message to the fans, explaining why the love she secreted to them for a long half year.
"I can claim that there is no one in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia who would escape that Dara caught a bear, then pardon, Ned," is kidding Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballist.
He said he packed it, not the opposite.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they do not have the joy of it.
And that's it.
What we both didn't look forward to, but we knew it would happen once, the singing continues.
I just don't know who's worse.
If those who don't care about it, and they're jumping out of the can, or we whose lives are questioning in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear the view of whether you and your husband or girlfriend were good enough, or you insisted that everyone really know the list of your former partners and have been informed about the number of your mistakes and errors.
That's a yellow, that's what you want. It's Dare.
The two were together in Italy, where Rolins traveled for the preparations of her new fashion collection.
The Ned has been acting as Vice-President of Juventus' football club.
They went out with the truth right now because they were waiting for the end of the Medved's divorce.
With my wife Ivana, they have been separated for three years, not their own paper but only three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us, we thank you.
We're just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have a heart in the right place.
And that's why I love my new man, and just like he's with me, I'm standing with him.
Hi, the other commentors have probably said all the important things, just confirming that the railways are great to the beginning, my fellow students mostly met, and two met, and then we found a deal together, which seems to me as the best option, because you know who you're going to live with.
The apartments mostly don't intensify too long forward, so you probably don't find much right now, but it won't hurt you looking at the offer.
Otherwise, you must avoid not only Cela but also the neighborhood (like Vranovska, French etc., it's a pretty bad address), and some parts of the Jews are a little ghetto.
On the contrary, the Vivery neighborhood is very student, the King's field, and that's the way it's cool, and it's also close to most VUT faculties (I don't know exactly where you go).
I've never been looking for a rent, but I'm born Brnjac, so I can, if possible, advise Brna as if you're missing any more information :)
But that's an example of totally "normal" thinking.
Because of what several doctors decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is ultimately fine that the State does not finance schools enough.
Either they teach what they want and pay it from their own or whether they go according to the state and pay for it.
We can't let a private actor control a piece of education only because a full-value State contribution will take place in a few crowns, and he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such claims are somewhat lost on weight when it is written by a person who two days ago expressed as such a petition action for the combat of the totality state:
So the voice against if someone goes to abortion is the same for you as a voice against any statue standing on the square?
I'd consult you directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I've already experienced a catalogue/digitalization that (i.e. long-year professionals) it either fits from the eye or writes something in the way of xxx *** or ... (convention) and that it's not readable.
The truth is, in this case, it's quite readable, so I probably wouldn't recommend it completely.
I would personally deal with it somehow in a note by what program you're using.
If you want to be a proper and hard student, you can look into some character databases and look for the nearest.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd say that the author or the printer simply created his own sign, which belongs to what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn't it more like the Odryn empire (King) than the Audrey?
PSS: Someone's already broken up on you.
Take a look at that comment with .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Politicians don't even know what will be the "theme" of our presidency.
That's a lot worse trouble than having translators with them.
The idea that they would approve of something because no one understood any text is smiley.
All important approved documents are studying the word from a word, and any basic knowledge of English is not enough, that's the matter of lawyers.
In various EU institutions, hundreds of translators and translators work, English is rather suitable to politics for informal contacts, incorporating overstandard relations.
Furthermore, with that English, it is quite interesting, after the GB appears from the EU.
I don't understand that hate on Cele.
I've been working there for the third year, and I'm fine.
How many times I drive from work at 10 a.m. and never a problem.
The fact that it's a ghetto can only say someone who almost did it in his life.
Yeah, it's probably most of the Roma population of Brna, but the only thing they're doing is that they're interrupting the path and parking where they don't have:D definitely it's not that I'm afraid to climb out there tonight.
So if you're looking for a relatively cheap living with good availability to the center, I'd just go into it.
Full of apartments are now reconstructed or newly built.
Felix Slovak (78) without Dada and lover Gelem as a colleague in the fence!
Who's going to spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the advent vein burned the first candle, Felix Slovak No.
I don't have an advent vein, so there was nothing to burn.
I've seen a branch, and Lucie must have had one, said to the Lightning Saxofonist, who so confirmed the words of Patras, that she's often visiting her.
He's visiting, but he's not living in their house in the Winehouses where Dada stayed alone after he left.
The Slovak still doesn't know where he's going to be on Christmas night.
We've recently met with Anicka, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slovak and Lucie Gelem: AGAIN!
Felix Slovak and Lucia Gelem: AGAIN!
But we were still talking about something, so it didn't happen on Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I'm buying gifts in time, and I'm sure I'll buy Dad and Lucia something, probably a perfume.
I'm a gentleman, he added Felix, who himself came to the baptism of the music video to the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel myself.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, the Slovak, who was happy to meet his wife Ludjak Saturday Adriana or Camille Nylt's singing.
And he made it clear.
And we're an Island so we can afford no soldiers and weapons?
I doubt someone's going to defend us for us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor has to be a complete idiot to avoid putting this territory.
And I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, so you can explain it to me?
I don't know any other file that could be placed in hospitals in the crisis.
The cops are few and they can't afford it, so the firemen and anywhere else, such a high percentage of health-trained people aren't at this level.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending so only Ostrava is headed to previous governments, not to the army, she's been asking for new toys for a long time.
Recorded drought in the Czech Republic.
Agricultural grants need to be changed, landscape is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
Czech Republic is passing the worst dry period in the last years.
The waters, according to scientists, have been destroyed in mountains and subhore areas, the smaller corner of the collapse also records places where no moisture has yet been necessary.
The cause of the drought in the largest part of Central Europe is climate change.
But it also strengthens the way we handle the land.
What are you ready to do with drought?
And how can we help the nature in difficult times?
Yeah, that's right, I'm barely holding up in ice brushes, mushrooms I know what to play hockey and the tactics (what I tried in Frances Hockey Manager) is also a total hall.
And whether you're a hockey team "mead of Russia" or "lama China" so lose two goals, even if you don't have to win the game at any cost, it's different than when it's compared.
But as I listen to the Czech commentators who push, what the judges don't notice whether a male or female hockey is, it's all weird, but it's probably all sports, EUFA and "Italian actors" or "Motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
There's controversy everywhere.
And if it was the opposite, it's like it's always been, and that Czech Republic and Russia have lost more often than winned, it'd probably be a classic "they're losing" in the "We's won".
Coronavir: Number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday 11 December, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily diseases.
5766 people were hospitalized.
Totally died in the Czech Republic 34,451 people, other 74.
Reaffirmed cases in the last 14 days are 1967 to 100 000, 871 per 100 000 per last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
29,929 new diseases have been registered in the last 24 hours.
It's the lowest daily number since October 13th.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10 016 896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, which is the lowest daily number of dead since the end of October.
Britain faces "inevitable" great wave infection caused by Omicron, Dr. Susan Hopkins, the principal medical advisor for the British Health Office on Sunday.
It will need new quarantine measures.
Persons infected with omicron are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their number to grow.
For now, no one died of microne, but some fourteen days after the disease and about three weeks after infection, hospitalizations have occurred.
The chief of British labourers Keir Starmer stated on Sunday that Boris Johnson must have violated the law by the fact that last December, when the lockdown was introduced and the Christmas partys were banned, he arranged a Christmas quiz in Downing Street.
One Minister of Johnson’s government defended that the quest was “virtually ” performed through the computer.
However, he was attended in Downing Street by a group of employees gathered around computers.
In Britain, pressure is stronger to remove Johnson from the Prime Ministerial Function.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers arranged despite the closing of many parties.
The British public and the media are angry that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV commercial television for Britain: Today two years ago Boris Johnson won mostly in general elections.
This morning, the Conservative Party says that it must be removed from the premier's function.
Excellent how quickly the events have evolved.
You want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is waiting for the spring of elections that can end the 12-year-old government of Victor Orban.
It will be the choices of European importance.
How much can you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They're probably not even free, because there were no last two choices under Orban.
His side Fidesh controls the media, changes the borders of the electoral districts to profit from it, and makes other smaller or bigger tricks.
So far, the last sounds like everyone can vote in practice wherever he wants.
This allows Fidesa to tie voters from decisive districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just saying they won't be fair at all.
Do you think this will be as unfair as in the years 2014 and 2018?
The situation is significantly different.
It was before, not if Fidesh wins, but how much and if he has a constitutional majority.
Now, there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will receive a united opposition.
It's a big inconvenience for Victor Orban and his side.
Wouldn't they try to keep it harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they're ready to go beyond what they've done so far.
Recently, it fled into independent media recordings by the President of Parliament and one of the leaders of Fideszu Laszlo Kövera, where it explains to the heads of secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security.
These are the signs of the new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of those news.
It's all starting with the language.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, mom's parents have no much patience, neither do I, Daddy has long, but then she blows extremely (only with me).
At the same time, I was very cholerical, and I was angry as a little awful, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a cream and the whole blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes I was dancing in a custody, sometimes it was rather like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have the tendency to deal with things with violence now, like a little girl, I've been pretty laundry, and now I'm gonna kick myself at least in something and as a younger one, I've had my parents so crushed over my hand like (i don't get too much over the arm), so I've never got anything extreme, but I've always got it.
I'm not able to determine how much this is my explosion, but I'm sure that the education has a share in it.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose my patience with my children, too, and I'm going to deal with it.
I think beating kids is just bad and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially at the moment that it wasn't "deductive," but from frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just fucks up, I don't think it's possible to screw up their kids at least, so I don't give it up.
It doesn't hurt me, I don't understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws should be clear and clear.
So I'd call them the laws in such a quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're afraid of the loss of income.
Can you really count on people who want and buy the product and what are you going to pay for?

The other government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of repository nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karl Havlicka needs to be reworked essentially
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiša is at the end and the law that was to ensure respect for the interests of the municipalities and their citizens in selecting and enabling the deep storage of high radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Government's legislative Council has interrupted the negotiation of a proposal submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after summer interrogations.
However, its content is in serious contradiction not only with the affected communities joined in the Platform against the depth storage but also with the Union of cities and the Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The self-government expects greater strengthenment of their options in the decision on the repository, as promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and required by the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to reconstruct in collaboration with the municipalities in accordance with its coalition agreement.
The proposal of the law from Minister Karl Havlick, which has the Platform available, in particular implies the municipalities: The proposed measure of involvement of the communities and the public in the process of decision-making of the location for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of the community and their citizens.
It can be effective only if the community or the public can affect whether the process will be resumed at any time.
This can be ensured by retaining the obligation of the Storage Management Board to require a consent before the specific proceedings of the communities concerned are initiated.
The proposed proposal for a real intention will almost completely reduce public involvement and make civilians practically statistical in permit procedures.
The draft lacks systemic compensation setting for the community for the whole search and selection of the location for the storage, its authorization and operation.
The representatives of the community in reality, according to today's legal standards, do not have too much opportunities to defend their citizens' interests in searching for a place for repository.
Only in certain authorisation procedures, they may make their comments or withdrawal, however, the Authority or the Minister shall decide to issue them in the interest of which the authorisation is issued.
The case complaint has no immediate effect on the implementation of research or construction work.
The co-decision of the self-determination requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democraticly-developed countries and definitely in those where they have already advanced in the authorisation of the repository, such as Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is, in addition, another failure of the State administration to rent external legal offices for the preparation of the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by SURRAO and related to contracts with lawyer Jane Zemank.
The total amount for these work is to be 4 million crowns, according to the registry of contracts.
Antonín Seknička, the senior of the town of Cejle from the area of Gradek and Platform against the deep storage, said: After the ministers of industry, who compared the position of self-supervisers to the public authorities in searching for a high radioactive repository waste, we are waiting for a more significant turnover from the new government.
We're offering helpful hand.
We also thank the Union of Cities and Municipalities, which considers the problem of insufficient rights of the municipalities in such a crucial construction as the directly affected community in the selected locations.
The platform against the depth storage shall combine 51 members (35 cities and 16 communities) in order to change the access of the State to load burned nuclear fuel and other radioactive wastes which will not be limited to the depth storage.
The Platform further proposes that the decision to choose the location for any storage is conditional on the previous consent of the municipalities concerned.
Herce John Goodman (69) made him lose fear: He dropped 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for years, he was eventually frightened by the doctors.
They told him he'd die if he didn't lose weight.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually dropped 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight 180 kg, informs The Sun.
He praised his new figure in Los Angeles at the animated series of the Freak Brothers.
He's a completely different man from the sitcom sitcom Roseanne!
John loved to joke that his friends and his family asked him to lose his weight because his great body caused a burst of furniture.

It also matters what boss and what the word "boss" you want to use.
If it's about any text on a platform that expects a reader from the game environment, I wouldn't even translate it.
If it was necessary for the formal and perhaps high school text, I would probably seek how to describe or explain the boss.
There's more types of boss in everything.
Like a game like Dark Souls, etc. has boss a few that, and so "boss" is something like a gentleman/master of the level, and then there's a final boss...
In many games there are hiding boss (super boss, hidden boss), who do not need to be defeated to be finished game or level, but often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then you need Half-Life games, where the boss are, but the player doesn't hit them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called at all?
And then they're mini boss.
It paushally unanimously somehow translate the boss simply doesn't even go, Czech and other languages do not solve it somehow (the interesting thing is just a catalan language that boss translates as a final opponent).
It is simply for story or game generally important, controlled by computer, opponent stronger than all previous and guarding the completion of some level or task.
After Peter's missing from London, he's looking for the whole world.
The Czech Police have also been involved.
After the missing Peter Srnz's searched for the British police since 3 December.
The Czech police have also been involved in searching.
The 32-year-old woman from Uhersko City has been looking for since December 7th.
Through Interpol at the same time helps the British police.
Czech Republic, Peter Srnz, saw her colleagues last November 28th.
The British police have been looking for her since December 3rd.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow orbit for her.
So Peter is looking for the whole world.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," confirmed police speaker Katerina Randlová.
“We share information to the case together,” she added.
An announced search for Petra has already appeared on the police website.
He says he's 168 inches high, he's thick and has brown eyes and long equal hair of the same color.
She's supposed to be from Uhersko Garden.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, and such disappearance is very unusual for her.
In order to search for Peter, there was also one of the Members of Harriet Harman.
She's involved in the hanging of Petra's face.
"We have huge concerns about her," she said at the Saturday press conference.
In connection with the disappearance, British cops have already arrested one suspect.
But it is not clear who and what he had to do with Peter.
The Czech Republic is terrorizing Agent Tesla.
While the data in October indicated a mild decline in attack campaigns, the attacks have significantly increased last month with the coming end of the year.
We recorded a great campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted on the Czech Republic.
The Strategy of attackers remains the same for now.
The infected Annex in the e-mail should raise attention to the user by the name referring to payments and financial transactions.
While last month had a dangerous annex named the word invoice, this time it was marked as a Copie of Repair Accounts for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal of Eseta.
Spyware contains functions that scan internet browsers and other programs such as Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex email clients.
The harmful code is actively searching for the recorded login data that he subsequently sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in Czech Republic on August and September, and with the coming holidays and at the end of the year, the activity of the attackers has grown again.
In November he remained active and spiware Formbook.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers are not concentrating specifically on the Czech Republic and security specialists have been captured rather in November with global reach.
In comparison with October's Formbook data, he slightly weakened in November, but still worth almost five of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
Formbook contained the most frequent .exe appendix with the name REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account continues to appear.
The annex in Czech may then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
A significant decline and suppression of activity record security analyses in the Fareit programme, which was 1.6 per cent of attacks and has not had a bigger attack campaign in the Czech Republic in recent months.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen because the oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The introduction of Prague was bigger than the media indicate.
According to the recordings of the Coast Travel and my experience, the demonstration is not afraid of estimates of about 10,000 people.
People in the railway filled the coast and the bridge and the opposite coast communication.
That means a lot of people really.
About four thousand demonstrators are spontaneously added to the quantity of the circuits.

It's hard to say what movement this dissatisfaction could be paid, it depends not only on the money intake, but also on whether the trousin vaccine from Pfizer becomes a quarter and more dose.
It's definitely not a left or middle movement, bet it.
The three-dose vaccine will almost definitely become multidose, because it is obvious that we will have to let ourselves overwatch every six months.
I'm very glad that the vaccines saved us.
The genius actions of scientists, to which humanity is rightly proud.
