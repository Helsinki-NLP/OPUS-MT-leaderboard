I bought a lot of books.
Please sit here.

Why does that matter?
Why are you staying with Tom?
Many insects disappeared in one night.
Tom's infantial.
Where's the subway station?
No one knows how I feel.
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
We want to stay for three more nights.

I got to the point.
I really don't know how else I can explain that.
I'm not sure Tom knows what to do.

Bowduck!
He loved Lila’s sister himself.

That's how it's done.
I love cats.
Are you looking for something specific?
Whose fault is this?
No one's stopping you.
Tom wants to join the team.
You're too thin.
Come here.
There's a map on the wall.
You're very beautiful.
I came to see you.
What's your favorite pizza?
The last point of view has many advocates in Japan.
You don't think you could do that?
I don't know what I can do for you.
Tom's smart.
He's tired.
If you go, I'll miss you.
You tell the wise man about a mistake, and he'll thank you, and tell the fool about a mistake, and he'll offend you.
That's a great idea.
I don't think there's anything.
Express your views clearly.
They don't know us.
Tom must have forgotten to say that to Mary.
You don't know where Tom lives?
I'll invite Tom to dinner.
Maybe I'll do it again.
Do you really think I'd do this?
It's a lie.
The war took their happiness.
I would like to have enough money to buy a car.
Mary took off her laptop.
You don't have to play with the key.
Wouldn't Tom want to do that?
This bridge is not safe at all.
Can that wait?

You're betraying.
I like drinking.
She sells an old-fashioned hat.
I love cats more than dogs.
Mary says she can't help us today.
You can go if you're determined.
He admitted his guilt.

I'd eat a bill.
I'm wondering if Tom can do that.
We are sure we can handle this.
His homeland is Germany.
It's an orange.
He's an atheist.
What is your aunt doing?
I played with the champion.
Tom warned you that this might happen.
Honestly, I disagree with you.
Mary said she believed that.
When are you leaving?
I have a lot of friends.
I wish I couldn't stay here forever.
After lunch, she always has time.
Suchille takes the smaller part of the earth’s surface.
I have a twin.
We begged Tom not to go there.
I think we might have been too aggressive.
You're big.
I have a little time off.
I'll help you tomorrow.
This story made me fun.
Careful with your head!
I'll miss you.
Take this.
Tom asked you to do something?
The dog Tom's name is Cookie.
I just changed the password.
I didn't do anything like that.
It took me about three hours to read this book.
The tooth fairy is a tooth thief.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Tom didn't want to wait.
I'm faithful.
I'm not very patient.
Jesse was talking French badly, and German was worse.
I just want to talk to them.
We didn't do anything wrong.
I'm frequently in trouble.
Tom's still doing what he needs to do.
He married my brother.

He was missing at the meeting.
It's Tuesday.
Someone must have told Tome, but it wasn't me.
Don't worry, we're leaving.
I'll fire fast.
He took a picture of the family.
We are often in Troms.
The English Bush is perfect.
Do you know what kind of blood Tom has?
I've never been to Europe.
Tom is trying to avoid arguing with Mary.
They'll understand.
There's only one store around the island.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do it.
Tom is deeply confused.
Anybody here?
Don't call me.
It's better to die standing than living on your knees.
Tom's already waiting.
Tom likes everyone.
I knew you'd wait for us.
I can't forget it.
They chose a new government.
Please wait five minutes.
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Bring me a clean bowl and take the dirty.
Tom told me he was on his own.
Here's the church we married.
I don't think Tom's gonna be missing.
I think it's logical.
I hope you won't be too disappointed.
He was popular among the voters.
Tom didn't give the French charges.
Elizabeth, Queen of England.
Where am I supposed to go?
Tom followed Mary’s example.
He gave me a pencil.
It's not that far from here.

This patient may die any time.
It was a coincidence.
I feel that if I had spoken more frequently with the language media, my skills in English would quickly improve.

We need answers.
There's nothing to be afraid.

He needs to be killed.
What are we going to eat tonight?
Did you find them already?
You have to give her more time.
What are you doing with this?
She treats him harshly.
You're such an asshole!
Dad bought me a book.
Tom's energy.
So many things didn't like.
Tom knew Mary wouldn't be busy.
The dry sand takes water.
You always loved Tom, didn't you?
Here you go!
Tom says he can't win.
I'm not going to do that.
Tom didn't seem insulted.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
You want me to get you a glass of water?
Tom told me he thought Mary was ugly.
She smiled at me.
You know what actors they are.
I don't think you're heartless.
It was built forever.
He tested it.
Whose friend are you?
Tom was too tired to work.
Tom dropped Mary's ball.
Tom's pretty persuasive, isn't he?
I miss talking to them.
He tried not to cry.
They are compassionate.

That's very delicious.
You shouldn't have signed a confession.
How are you feeling today?
Here's our teacher.
Thank God, I'm atheist.
It's my daughter.
I gave it to a little boy.
Did you think about that?
Mathematics is the subject I love less than anything.
Take Tom home.
I hid it somewhere.
Wouldn't you come to my party?

I sat to the store next to Tom.

Come tomorrow.
What insects did you eat?
I saw Tom hit the car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do it.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
I know how the stepler looks.
I can't confirm that.
Mary guarantees it.
I got in the wrong bus.
I refused this offer.
Mary already did what she had to do.
I watched Tom.
Did you book the table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
How about a picnic ride.
We couldn't buy tickets for a concert until we got money from our friends.

Maybe another time.

I'm a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
You need him here.
We're out of oil.
What do you think they want?

Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a colleague and a potato fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new house!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom willingly accepted.
I think Tom's wrong.
Are you all right?
Maybe you're the only one who can do it.
Who's not right?
Your singing makes professional singers red from shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!

He was big.
Tom knows that Mary didn't do it.
Esther is a Jew lesbian.
The dog bit me last week.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.

You're lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's dinner time.
It's unlikely Tom's gonna forget how it's done.
Do you drink?
Will Tom do this with you?
You're not sleeping?
The meeting started at 5:00.
Mary said she liked to do it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I was in Tokyo only once.
I got an account for electricity.
What color is his sweater?
Last week I bought a new car.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know that Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom was going to do that.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Don't you feel comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A little cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning to do this with?
We are satisfied with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He was standing at the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented for his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
He'll find out.

Tom's over.
When I walked into the room, she played a piano.
You're very sweet.
Where are your manners?
They did not lose hope.
Tom threw the egg in Mary.
When do you expect to come?
Tom was scratching his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party is going?
Mary's tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Okay, I'll bite.
I don't want it anymore.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're glad.
I'm jealous of your good health.
Yeah, I'd love to!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
Almost spring.
She speaks two foreign languages.
That's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me this?
Let's go back.
Tom's not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom's very embarrassing.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to come up with a secret language.
Are you planning to stay for a long time?
When are you planning to go to Japan?
My kids are at school.
I put my suitcase.
I got out of the car.

She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to swim the river.
He apparently loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom's younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom's very open.
I'm hungry because I didn't have lunch.
I don't blame anyone.
The plane flew at nine.
Tom speaks French quite freely.
John caught a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it out myself.
Tom was dry with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I have a lot of time.
Let me be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need the facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
The next month Tom is leaving Boston.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Each year, millions of people die of hunger.
I was wondering what Tom wanted.
The letter was wrong.
This is the last train.
Who's going to fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all in chocolate.
They moved into another religion.
I need to be more careful.
I jumped them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What is he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do this?
We could save them.
He's a strange person.
I'm just scratching.
Mary said she never studied French.
I think I'll buy a new car.
It's our fault.
You're so cute.
It's going to cost about $15.

His theory is worth attention.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
It's not a new problem.

I like this dog.
I tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How's the examination?
Where was the book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing this.
We need to help Tome.
It's been raining all day.
I'm sad about that.
Can I have your phone number?
You should stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock leaves for ten minutes.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines the day, and the night the moon.
I got on her.
You were right earlier.
I hope Tom will help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I'm in trouble with the boss.
It's a banana.
Tom will probably be punished for what he did.
Mary is your girlfriend?

Do you usually travel abroad?
You need to be flexible.

Get away from me.

Listen to his open mind.
Aren't you in order tonight?
Tom never had to learn much.
How's your wife, Tom?

I wish you weren't such a fucking asshole.
Did Tom give you something for me?
I would never have been able to do this without your help.
I've always got coffee and cupcakes for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I didn't breakfast.

All your friends will be there.
It's Tom's fault.
I would have done it if you didn't stop me.
The problem is you.

You'll never be alone.

You don't need to be nervous about these little things.
You bastard.
Is that you?
Please call a doctor!
I'm too busy to drive.
Find someone else.
Do you have professional experience?
Is this the only solution?

It's going to be very difficult to do it.
It's ours.

He loves football.
Birthdays are important.
Here's your key.

Drop that ball.
Tom is trying to understand what he's doing.
Is that a positive news?
We are not hungry yet.
See Tom's boat?
Tom doesn't do everything he can.
I'm sure you'll find a good job.
You're thin.
Tom doesn't trust the police.
Perhaps this world is a hell of another planet.
He grabbed the butterfly, stuck it between the big and pointing fingers.
It's a tasty cookie.

Did Tom tell you how long it took to do that?
Let's start!
Attention!
I'm completely exhausted.
Perspectives are not too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I am fascinated by the devil's literary song.
The poor is that she lacks experience.
I spent a while in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary called their child John.
I wonder if Tom would actually go to Mary's concert.
Tom said that he spent the weekend with it?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us how to sing.
Let's not do anything in general.
Tom wants his father buried next to his mother.
Do you think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm DJ.
I hate Christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It's too expensive.
The child was lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You should learn to abstain.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true about Japan.
We're losing.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Speak.
The surface of the air bullet is an ineffective space, so it does not comply with the rules of euclide geometry.
The negotiations were successful.
I apologize for that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I tried to call you.
I've never killed anyone.
Be honest and straightforward.
There's always hope.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice older than me.
The journalist was kidnapped by terrorists.
I dropped the ball.
I hate this city.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
The programming languages are his hobby.
I'm glad to hear that.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and I too.
How many clock do you have?
Tom's deaf.
That's why you don't like to eat fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom is very proud of you.
Your doctor says you'll be fine.
You're a panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need that money.
My orange tie.
Tom's gonna cry?
So it would be hailing to be higher.
I need to help my mom.
His book inspired me.
Are you brothers?
It's not my ideas.
You have a plan, right?
He's walking.
Tom's not in town.
I had shoes.
The next year will be worse.
Mary's in the yellow dress.
Love is a bitter taste.
The meeting is over.
You should have done it last year.
I thought I couldn't do it.
I have an old car.
We understand why.
I'm eating a year.
I felt helpless.
I like a teacher.
Let's go on the elevator.
Tom is a professional hockeyist.
We went into the woods looking for insects.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.
A small cup of coffee is worth two euros.
Mother’s love is greater than anything.
He persecuted a thief.
I worked at a restaurant.
I'm not determined enough.
It won't be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I really don't want to eat now.
The fragments of the mirror were divorced on the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich with natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She walked out of school.
Tom sat next to the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom, I don't think I should do this.
State debt is increasing.
Why am I, not you?
Tom probably will never do that.
It's a doll.
Help me!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widow.
I read this story in a book.
Does Tom still have a bike?
Speak short.
Tom's smarter.
It was a tough night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do it.
I'm a teacher.
You had a good time, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do that.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time on the Internet.
You're charming.
Tom said he would complain.
Let's meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't spend it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's coming in 30 minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car.
We can talk.
Computer can count very quickly.
You're not needed.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather?
I'm thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even change peppers.
People still use webcams?
I wonder if Tom once asked Mary why she quit school.
This word is lended from Greek.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
Brother is sick.
Don't push.
The car's outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost the money.
No rules.
Layla was pregnant very quickly.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make a raw fish salad?
Tom knew Mary knew.
Tom's preparing breakfast.
No doubt it will rain.
Tom did not mention Australia.
Obviously, Tom and Mary are more than just friends.
We were actually going to Boston.
In Iceland, many volcanoes.
John's older than I am for two years.
Better or worse, but television has changed the world.
I'm a little fat.
He easily answered my question.
What is the purpose of your journey?
Tom's looking for something.
He must be innocent.
I love children.
Who's left?
When does she arrive?
It's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm very glad I did it yesterday.
Is Tom still living next to you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't drop the stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you often meet him?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She has wine.
You're gonna stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in a twenty-third year.
Tom's probably going to take care of it.
It must be the right color.
Tom has a very strict mother.
After a short peace, war was again solved.
Better not to trust Tome.
Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam.
I don't understand your French.
What is the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you hand me a sugar?
Where exactly does Tom plan to build his house?
“Where is my laptop? ” — “On the chair. ”
I don't think there's any problem.
Did Tom break?
You need to get haircut.
Green's good for you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary's playing football.
How does this work?
You're very ugly.
Hurry up, boys.
I fixed the shirt.
When is it expected to be returned?
I had a good rest.
He's not less than good than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I'm making too many mistakes.
He is not afraid of death.
It would be good if it was 28 hours, wouldn't it?
Kobe is a city where I was born.
He would like this disaster not to happen.
We do not expect victory.
I don't have any money.
I'm not teaching here anymore.
We didn't find a boy.
Go on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's DJ.
Soon Tom will learn to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They can catch fish.
Tom left the room.
I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom teaches French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thought he could do it.
I don't have books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He's, like, a robot man.
Answer the question!
You need you in the hospital.
I can't find a lift.
It's a fake.
That's not Tom asked Mary to do it.
He's got green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom often mistakes.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom never was in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the television, it was transmitting Gran Pree.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do this.
English is not my own language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's this girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So we should not do that again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom looked at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of her children until she's gone.
I'm cooking.
Did you see Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
He is often late.
Remember that summer when Tom shaved his head?
Why did Tom do that?
I know this girl's father.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't come with us.
I got 30 points.
If I don't, Tom will be mad.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Don't you write it?
The great tree fell on the road, and when I drove, the road stopped me.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that shines.
I don't have a lot of friends.
Do you believe in the existence of a god?
I live in Boston.
Tom's blind since his birth.
He did not answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Don't you start boring?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I'm not working for you.
I can do this for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he doesn't.
That's what I tried to do.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new sank.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister Sakiko, and she's born the same year as I did, and now she's preparing for examinations.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you completed your homework?
Monday may be busy for the day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I disagree with him.
Perhaps you should help paint the fence.
Why do people act like big monkeys, and the opposite?
Can you help me?
You're an asshole.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go to the doctor.
I gave you the visa papers.
Snow is coming today.
She continued to work.
The rope broke when we went to the mountain.
Tom's driving.
If you had less hamburgers, you would probably be more healthy.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to leave myself.
Please show me how this is done.
Don't you see anyone?
All the stores are busy.
I haven't decided yet.
What's the date today?
Where's Dad?
Lock the door.
I'm not gonna talk to Tom French.
The apple does not fall far from the apple.
Be realistic.
Who did you talk to?
Uncle is your father’s brother or mother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She's got red eyes.
They're not coming back.
I was in my jeans.
I'll see you after the spectacle.
I'd like to ask you a question.
It's my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined Satan’s Church.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm cautious.
Do you mind?
I haven't seen you forever.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are they?
That's what you want to do, right?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom walks the dogs twice a day.
Let me take a look at Tom's book.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoka, Honceu, and Cusio.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't do it.
Do you think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I'm not gonna help you.
Take it easy.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compare him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you realize that?
She committed suicide.
We've made our office computers.
We have to pay in advance.
Are you sure?
Do you think Tom's gonna die?
Don't you plan to stay?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Do you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I still teach French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has three times more books than I do.
You missed a lot of things.
I'm wearing shoes.
You can count on me.
His book has become the object of criticism.
It'll be brilliant.
I'm so scared.
You need to help her, and quickly!
That's a lot worse.
I'm under fly.
You didn't waste your time.
Who knows when Tom will do that?
Tom testified in Mary’s case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can I ask your name?
I wrote you ten letters.
What do we do?
Don't you vote?
You should stop smoking.
I think Tom's betraying.
I know many French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Do you know how to play violin?
Can you hand me salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
He was popular both among students and teachers.
You can't help with tears of grief.
Tom plays football and runs.
You can go anywhere you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom couldn't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hanged the phone.
I'll be right back.
The church is near the bottom of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did you do that?
More coffee, please.
Tom's trying to convince Mary to do it.
Tom's calling you.
You have to say To him to do it.
He speaks in esperanto with a small French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't care.
She has good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom will come to my party.
Tom told me he didn’t like to speak French.
That sounds good, isn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a lady contractor.
I'll handle it.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a wizard?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Get the fuck out of here.
You're going to let that's why you're going to get away with you?
You're a good woman.
There's hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Tom really moved to Boston?
Tom stretched Mary a beer.
How did you know Tom wasn't here?
Children grow so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you get back from London?
Isn't you still cold?
The linguistic media underconsciously follow the rules of their language, not even aware of them.
Tom's on vacation.
What happens if I press this button?
The hunters targeted their guns on the elephant.
No one's worries.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Tom’s wife is Canadian.
Do you have any allergy?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do this.
I'd like to take off the money.
I'm shaking Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Tom's not a member of this club anymore.
You shouldn't worry about tomorrow's examination.
Did Tom vote?
I'll be back.
Tom won't make Mary do that.
Tom started to sneak.
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom’s wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You don't get away.
I am Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you spend your holidays?
Did you get a Christmas present from Tom this year?
I still miss my home, and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have a memory problem.
Where's Mom?
He was conscious three hours after the crash.
Do you speak Macedonian?
You shouldn't talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom all right?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know the reason?
Check the voice mail.
She speaks in three foreign languages.
Tom's a little away from the schedule.
Tom's not a hero.
Can you catch a cab here?
Hurry up, you're gonna be late.
It's going to be difficult.
Is Tom always acting like that?
I like playing golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to speak so loud.
Our team needs your help.
You're never lying.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "the boy"?
It's going to work, you'll see.
She dropped him.
Tom's safe.
I finally got the driver's rights.
I'm not a student.
So Mary was sorry.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom keeps checking the phone.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom's not rich, Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone's late but me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don't plan on scattering the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom has a lot of strange ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with a client.
I'm disappointed in your efficiency.
Have you never had a car before?
You were at work?
What are you teaching?
I'm sorry I ate those blankets.
Hello.
Please write your name with a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She completely ignores me.
Tom's going out tonight.
I told you.
She was heading to the airport.
She studies portuguese in Brazil.
What are you going to tell them?
How did you know that would happen?
What's up?
If the natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, the esperanto can be compared to the plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's staying in Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a nice garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you just did your job.
We're going to walk.
Tom said what happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
Did you tell 'cause I was kidding?
So it was awfully boring.
Tom said I'm pretty.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's tolerable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
Are they suspecting me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Get out of the garbage.
Don't you come back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Your sister is as beautiful as always.
It'll be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How horrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
When you hire him to work, you should consider his youth.
We're sure it wasn't a coincidence.
It's his intruding idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom was unwilling to leave the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white dress.
Check it again.
Tom has a doctor's son.
I know that's going to be impossible.
Do you have any headaches?
Children imitate friends, not parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with his friends outside.
Whatever happens, keep calm.
Tom sent Mary messages.
He's always happy.
When Mary reached the bus stop, the last bus was on the road.
Tom's in the black coat today.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We usually spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They eat.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're worthless.
You tried to talk to them?
It was a lot harder than it thought to do.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom can win.
The aliens are coming and taking our job from us, the land for the lands, deporting the Marsians!
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
Are you going on a train?
Tom said Mary was pretty.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still asleep, aren't they?
Is that why you still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He left abroad, and he never returned.
Collect your toys together.
It was a lot harder than it thought to do.
I think I've done a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why it's interesting.
Have you finished your job?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's not difficult to do.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I'm not as high as my brother, but higher than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the candy.
I never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was too heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I still wanted to sell it.
Tom said that Mary didn't think she would.
You missed something.
I called Tom immediately.
You seemed interested.
This will help.
I'm going to sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to achieve his purpose.
Ken has two cats.
I figured out what my mistake was.
I love journeys.
The phone doesn't work.
That's what we want.
Tom in the sun-protection glasses.
Tom's doing good painting.
All you need to do is press the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can I get a suit for the Halloween?
Tom's busy and he can't help you right now.
We're not money.
He wants to see you as a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm starting with a fever.
Why are you not sleeping?
Tom really thinks someone's listening?
You don't have to give it!
Tom, it's good.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I had to go early.
I met him accidentally.
Why do you like it?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's having a humiliation.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's sleeping.
Tom’s wife asked him to leave his work.
Could you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted the orphanage.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a free ticket.
You're such a intolerable man.
What's going on here?
Tom said you speak French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, she's boneless.
I am very interested in a French study.
Stay nice to the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a lamp I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the shop.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're pleased with your job.
Are you working around here?
You admit that, don't you?
I have business tomorrow.
I'm disgusting.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but I grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, but I'm not used to understanding.
I share everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom is talking about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
She was cancelled.
My country is hugely inhabited.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I'm badly sleeping.
Don't you buy that?
Women are good.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did it?
Did you do it?
I'm having trouble sleeping.
Tom sometimes irritates me.
I'm dancing pretty well.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It's obvious that you'll be more cheap to sleep in us.
He doesn't even watch TV.
I never said no.
Rio already has a subway.
Are you ready to help us?
Tom is a rare bastard.
His hair was increasingly thin and thin.
My sister went to Cobe yesterday.
Don't you speak from a point of view of experience?
He loves ice cream.

What do you need to know?
She has twice as many CDs as I have.
The street is empty again.
Tom couldn't catch the rabbit.
All dogs are faithful.
I think Tom hates me.
We're so happy.
Tom and Mary are both very upset.
Don't you stay with us?
It's communism.
This is where the river suddenly steadys.
Jesus is a parasite.
I don't often do that.
Tom is a very practical person.
I've got a good taste.
I'm going to need a political shelter.
It was quiet after the storm.
There is no simple way to succeed.
Here's the train.
He loves tigers.
It's raining, so we can't do it.
It was extremely surreal.
These students are Koreans.
Get out of here!
What's your name?
Tom and Mary are going to retire when they're sixty-five.
Can I use your phone?
Your suffering makes me happy.
When did you do anything for me?
We closed the door.
There he is!
We're different.
Tom and Mary know?
Are you all right?
Don't sleep with the light on.
He's not stupider than you.
The trains in Serbia are terribly slow.
I feel like Tom's bad.
"Koni" is a set of words "cone."
Where's the pepper?
Can you explain what you're talking about?
I'm sorry I didn't tell him the truth.
He didn't dare say no to my plan.
Tom told the boring neighbor to take care of his life and to stop swing his nose into the business of others.
It was part of the plan.

I heard you kissed Tom.
Let's go!

Are you French or English?
He turned behind the corner.
Just keep doing what you do.
You made three mistakes.

Without effort, there's nothing to do.
Do you want to know how?
Do you like Chinese food?
That's why Tom went to Boston.
He resigned at 65 years of age.
I lost my pen.

This is our first Christmas here in Australia.
I take care of my grandfather.
I'm going to leave at 10:00 in the morning.
You're on the train?
You're not as young as Tom.
He slowly recovers from disease.
In Rome, he does like the Romans.
He saw the expression of surprise on my face.
Hurry up, and you'll get to the train.
It could be cancer.
I wonder if Tom would actually do that.
I don't like ice cream.
I don't want to sell the car.
I just want to measure it.
Tom's car was confiscated.
Could you open the window?
I wonder if Tom's scared.
How well do you know Tom?
You can go.
I got Tom's keys.
Let us in.
I'd like more butter.

I don't think Tom wanted to do this himself.
Hello!
Buy me a bike.
Fun in the full middle.
