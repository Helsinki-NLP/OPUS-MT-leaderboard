Members of the Valian congregation are concerned that they are “like Mupetcom”
Some members of the congregation are disturbed by the proposal to be named by the new MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, p. member of the Valian parliament).
This occurred because of the plans to change the name of the congregation into the Valijan Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned that they will smile.
The member of the labourist-type congregation said that they were concerned in their group because the name was rimated with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales: in Valian Twp, it means foolish and pwp cocoat.
The member of the Plejd Cymru Party said that their group as a whole “not satisfied” and proposed other options.
The Valigian Conservative said that his group of “open spirit” as regards the change of the name, while noting that the words of the MWP and Muppet were a small difference in the phrase.
In this context, the statement of the Valijan letter ‘w’ is similar to the word ‘u’ in the yorxhir language.
The Commission of the Assembly, currently preparing the draft legislation for the introduction of a change in the name, stated: “The final decision on possible descryptors for members of the congregation will, of course, have to be adopted by the members themselves.”
The Valijan Assembly, with the law of the Government of Wales Act 2017, received the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Valijan Parliament.
For the members of the congregation, the Commission has chosen the name ‘Welsh Parliament’ or ‘WMP’, but in the public consultation, it has received the most support of ‘MWP’.
Members of the congregation clearly propose other options, but reaching the agreement will be a difficult task for the Presidential Officer Elyn Jones, which must submit a draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes in the functioning of the congregation, including the rules on the incompatibility of the functioning of members of the congregation and the establishment of a committee system.
Members of the congregation will participate in the final vote on their names in the discussion on legislation.
Macedonians will decide by referendum to change the name of the country
Volunteers will vote on Sunday whether they will turn their country's name into the Republic of North Macedonia.
By voting, they want to solve decades of long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province named Macedonia.
The Athens have long insisted that the name of their northern neighbours represents the right to their territory and have repeatedly opposed its request for EU and Nate membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not take into account the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including the President of the Government, Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is the price they must pay for EU and Nate's accession.
The bells in St. Martin's Church have been silent because the churches in Harlem face problems
“The older people I talked to say that sometimes the bar and the church were on every corner, ” Adams said.
“There is no one of the others today.”
He explained that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“Now people hang out differently.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighbors where people start regularly.”
In the churches, however, he is concerned that money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that they will soon be again at the beginning.
He added that churches could be replaced by housing buildings with a common government (condominic), where people who will not help the shelter in the neighborhood remaining.
“The majority of the people who buy condomies in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and that will soon come the day when all these churches will be closed, since it is unlikely that people who move into these condomies will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white religious communities before Harlem became black metropolitan – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decades later.
The original white methodistic church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community who was serving worship in the neighborhood.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the leadership of the honorable John Howard Johnson, who was on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycot of sellers who did not want to hire or support the dark people.
In 1939 the fire severely injured the building, but when the patriarchs of Johnson planned renewal, they ordered ringing bells.
The honored David Johnson, the son of father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bells “bells for poor people. ”
In July, the expert named them a little differently: “Cultural treasure” and “unreplaceable historical instrument”.
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also stressed that these were the first ringing bells on which the dark musician played, Dionisio A. Link, who went to the church of Riverside Church 18 years ago, where we knocked on larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced in St. Martin's Church.
In the Church of St. Martin’s, in the last few months, a complicated story with architects and contractors has been held; some have brought church laiques and other bishops.
Zakristia, the Administrative Authority of the Laiques, wrote to the Bishop that she was concerned that the Bishop would “seek to transfer the costs” to the court, although the county was not involved in the employment of the architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some mayors complained about the transparency of the bishop.
The sea dog hurt a 13-year-old man while hunting lobsters in California
The officials report that on Saturday, the sea dog attacked and damaged 13-year-olds during the hunting of lobsters at the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred just about 7 hours in the morning near Beacon’s Beach Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV television in San Diego that on Saturday morning he drowned with his friends when he heard the boy screaming to help, and then he flew to him and helped him pull it out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was just impressed because he caught a lobster, and then realized that he screamed “He bit me!
He bit me!"
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had a broken whole lock.
“I screamed for them to go out of the water, “There is a sea dog in the water!” he added.
The boy was transferred with a helicopter to the Council's Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical state.
The type of sea dog responsible for the attack is not known.
The water rescue, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press statement that a few weeks ago, the sea dog was observed in this area, but it was found that it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries from the upper part of the body.
Responsible for 48 hours has been disabled access from the beach Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Ecinitas for investigation and security.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of marine dogs in this area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans access to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beautiful corners as they have in the high-levels, and with professional staff.
As part of the entrance to the British beauty market, worth 2.8 billion GBP and still grows, while sales of clothes and household machines falls will be tested in 11 shops in the country, and the next year in several shops, if they prove to be successful.
Investing in beautiful products, they decided because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the sheets used earlier for television, microwave ovens and household apparatus.
In Sainsbury, they say that they would double their offer of their beauty products to 3000 products and include signs such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing offer of marks L’Oreal, Mordalline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space in areas with trademarks similar to those in stores such as Boots.
Supermarket also restores its booth offer of cosmetic products, so most of the vegan products are something younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
Furthermore, Fragrance Shop's sales perfumes will test the concession in two Sainsbury’s shops. The first week opened in Croydon, South London, and the other opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, by the end of the year.
Because of online shopping and daily shopping of smaller foods in local sales stores, supermarkets must make more effort to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, executive director at Sainsbury’s, said that retail stores will be similar to the high-shoppings, since the supermarket chain is trying to fight Alda and Lidl's discontoms with several services and non-living products.
The Sainsbury’s group opened outlets Argos in several hundred shops and also the Habitat store since two years ago, which increased the sale of foods, and the downloads were more profitable.
The previous supermarket attempts to renew their departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury’s launched a joint trip with the Boots chain in the beginning of the 21st century, but the link ended after a dispute regarding the division of profits from drugs in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s three years ago for 125 million GBP sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 Celesio trades owned by Lloyds Pharmacy.
They stated that Lloyds would play a role in this plan, since in four shops, they would extend the offer of luxurious marks for skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a commercial director at Sainsbury’s company, said: “We have changed our appearance and impression of our beautiful cats and thus improved the environment for our clients.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues that will be available for consultation.
Our offer of marks is designed to meet all the needs, the attractive environment and the manual locations mean that we are now an interesting beautiful destination, which is a challenge for the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones “anger” because Holly Willoughby retired from work worth 11 million pounds
The star shows Dragons Den (Good Business) angry because the Holly Willoughby television leader has withdrawn from the work worth 11 million pounds, with its trademark of lifestyle to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their brand of clothes and supplements to Truly.
The business couple was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow trade mark.
The head of this Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby angered the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones, since in the last minute she retired from their profitable business with a sign of lifestyle to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was “anger” when a golden girl of television was on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company's seat in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that because of its new jobs, up to 1,5 million pounds, there was no longer time to devote to their trademarks of clothing and supplements to Truly.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow trademark and predicted that its property should be doubled by 11 million GBP.
When the 37 - year - old Willoughby in Instagram announced to leave Truly's trademark, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source states: “Truly was the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future, which would be survived for the next two decades.
Her decision to retire has totally surprised everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on, since the opening was so close.
The seat of the company in Marlow is full of goods prepared for sale.’
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning, one of the most interesting banks in Britain, would stand over millions because of large investments in products, from blazins and candles to clothing and supplements, and additional delays in opening.
Furthermore, this may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were a good friend for ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly together with Cappo in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them as President in March.
The couples were holidays together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become Ambassador of the M&S Mark and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV show I’m A Celebryty.
The source near Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business. ”
Hard talk “and then we fell in love ”
He was kidding about media criticisms for the comment that some seemed “unpresidency” and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump resign?
Trump said with his ridiculous "new" voice:
“I didn't give up anything.”
He pointed out that Kim showed interest in the second meeting. Their first meeting in Singapore, June, Trump, marked a major step against the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly meeting that North Korea did not see “suitable response” to the previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that, instead, the United States continues to sanctions that continue their pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his invitation.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
But now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim had brought positive results – the missile tests stopped, helped free hostages and brought home the death remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in the conversation of relations with Kim.
“It may be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this full scene, we have 200 people standing here” Trump said and pointed to the crowd directly in front of us.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia desolate the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in removal of the effects of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs have been told that they do not need their assistance.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboc population were moved, they did not declare natural disasters, which is the condition for sending international assistance.
“In many cases, they were very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation is a little complicated," Sumbunga said.
The Organization Save the Children comprises a team to travel to Palo, but it is not clear whether foreign personnel can help on the ground.
Sutopu, a representative of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials evaluate the situation in Paluo and determine whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Since the earthquakes in Indonesia are a station, the country remains completely unprepared for anger of nature.
In Aceh, they built sanctuary in tsunami, but on other coasts, this is not common practice.
The apparent absence of the warning siren for tsunami in Palui was likely a contribution to the loss of life, although the warning was applicable.
The journey between many Indonesian islands is also a challenge in the best times.
Because of natural disasters, logistics are even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which has been inhabited in Lomboc to help victims of the earthquake, swims against Palui, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has set up the improvement of the destructed Indonesian infrastructure in front of his election campaign and spent a lot of money for roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit is a problem for the Yokov administration in re-electing next year.
Joko also faces the pressure of long-term tension between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than ten thousand evacuated from their homes because the Christian and Muslim mobs fought on the streets with machetes, elbows, bullets and other primitive weapons.

Cromwell's statue in Parliament became the latest memorial target of the dispute on “Rewrite of History”
His removal would be a poetical right to destroy a number of English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical puritanis.
However, Cromwell Society marked Crick's proposal as “idioticity” and“a try to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate on the elimination of statues, it became clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westministration of the Palace would become a target. ”
Iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars has not even ordered or implemented.
He may be sacrificed for the acts of his ancestor in the past century by the wrong Cromwell.
The wonderful presentation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a witness of the 19th century’s opinion and is part of the history of personality, which, in some, it is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “The number of Cromwells (maybe even more late in the 19th century than today) seem to be a parliamentary protector against external pressure, in his case of monarchy.
If this is an exact show, it is the subject of continuous historical debates.
Clearly, in the middle of the 17th century, the dispute has formed further development of our nation, and Cromwell is recognized as a individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements from the time when Lord was a Protector also deserve celebration and remembrance.”
A killer pig killed a Chinese farmer to death
After local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at the southwest market in China.
The man who was identified only by the name “Yuan ” was found dead with a cut arteries and covered with blood near the pig market in Liupanshui, province Guizhou, was reported on Sunday at South China Morning Post.
The pigs' vegetable is prepared to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Following the report, I should travel with my cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighbouring pig was open.
He said there was a big pig male in the pig with a bloody mushroom in the pig.
The forensic investigation has confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig has killed a farmer to death.
“ Brother's feet were bloody and denied, ” the cousin name “Wu” quoted in Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera recordings showed that Yuang came to the market Thursday at 4:40 to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan wasn't either his or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so he wouldn't attack anyone else while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and market leadership were to negotiate the compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, with a man suffering severe physical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram pig squeezed a valish farmer along the tractor, but then the wife threw the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer in Manitoba for CBC News said that pigs are usually not attacking, but the blood taste can act as “explosives”.
"We'd just play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
It is only necessary to show them sufficient respect," he still said.
In the southwest of the United States, the residues of the Orkan Rosa are coming by a strong rain
According to the prophecies, the Orkan Rosa moves towards the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and the weak.
However, Rosa will bring floods in the northern Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next days.
Rosa is from a week from 5:00 a.m. after the eastern time of the Orcan 1 category with wind speed 137 km/h and is located 620 km south-west of Punte Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is strengthened by a low air pressure area moving east to the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baja California halfway on Monday as a tropical storm and will push high tropical moisture to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up 250 mm rain on Monday in Mexico.
In the coming days, the tropical moisture that will mix with a low air pressure area will create abundant declines in a wider south-western region.
Locally from 25 to 100 mm rain will cause dangerous floods, flood disposal and the possibility of land plasmas in the desert.
Due to the high tropical moisture, the amount of drops in certain places will be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in the parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west parts, especially above the largest part of Arizona, it is expected from 50 to 100 mm of rainfall.
The floods are possible due to a rapid deterioration of the situation due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
It would be very unreasonable to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
The powerful rain can turn canyons into barley rivers, and the storms will bring local sunshine winds and dust in the air.
The nearby air pressure area will be brought to the parts of the southern California coast of the local rain.
Possible debris are over 12 mm, which can cause smaller disposal of floods and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain for the region in the rain period.
Several dispersed tropical boards will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and on Monday early morning, late on Monday and Tuesday, the drops will spread.
The powerful rain will spread on all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will also last on Wednesday.
In the United States, there can be great temperatures, since the Arctics are cold, and the tropical areas remain very warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperatures at short distances.
The Sunday is an excellent example of a dramatic difference in the temperature in the central part of the United States.
Between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, there is 20 degrees of difference.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to resist and extend again.
Most of the Central and East United States will enter the warmth of October with temperatures approximately 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to the parts of the northeast.
In New York, we could have 27 °C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees more than average.
Our long-term forecast shows good opportunities for temperatures above the average of the US east in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people mirrors the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people in six television networks viewed the interesting Thursday testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political pat position continued because the TV stations terminated the regular program due to Friday's reverse in the last minute: the agreement made by the Arizonan Senator Jeff Flake, namely, that the FBI would conduct a united investigation of the charges.
Ford told the judicial committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh had been scratching her and trying to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a burning testimony that he was 100% convinced that this didn't happen.
Nelsen reports that more than 20.4 million people should take a look at the testimony on Friday.
The company considered the average viewing of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not available immediately for other networks that played testimony, including PBS networks, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Furthermore, Nelsen usually has some problems with the number of viewers watching the program in offices.
For a lighter show, the audience is similar to the one playing the football game of the final or the awards of the American Film Academy.
Television Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, leads to all the networks with a average of 5,69 million viewers, reports Nelsen.
The second place is ABC with 3.26 million audiences.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2,52 million viewers, reports Nelsen.
The interest remained high after the interrogation.
Flake played a central role on Friday drama.
After a moderate republican's office made a statement that he would vote in Kavanough, the CNN and CBS television camera recorded on Friday morning when the protesters were screaming at him when he tried to enter the elevator to participate in the hearing of the Justice Committee.
In a few minutes, he hung the view of what cameras of the CNN were captured live.
“I stand here before you, ” a woman said to him.
"You think he's telling the truth to the country?
You have power, while many women are irregular.”
Flake said that his office made a statement, and he added that he would say more at the committee's hearing, and then the door lifted closed.
All television networks have been transmitted live hours later when the Justice Committee voted on the surrender of Kavanaugh's appointment to a vote in the Senate.
But Flake said that it would only be done if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, as the minority party of democrats called for.
Flake was partly convinced to talk to a friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and more other senators, Flake took his decision.
Flake's voice was determined, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to appoint Kavanaugh without investigation.
The President Trump launched an investigation of the US Federal Investigation Office (FBI) on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the criticism of the “playing of political games” in Brexite

In another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson increased his attack on her so-called brexite plan from Chequers and said that the proposal was that Britain and the EU would pay customs other “a totally absurd”.

Vulcan vomiting ashes on Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes vomiting by the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern neighborhood of the Mexican capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano on Saturday, since the activity in the carter increased and observed 183 gas and ashes in 24 hours.
The Center observed several cases of thunder and earthquake suns.
The pictures on social networks showed thin layers of ashes that covered the windscreens of cars in the neighbourhoods of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
The geophysics observed the increased activity in the volcano, located 72 miles south-east of the capital, after the earthquake of September 2017, at the power of 7,1 degree, shook the central Mexico.

Police in conflict with catalonic separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protesters who supported independence struggled against unexpected police units and thousands of people joined the rival demonstration that marked the first anniversary of the catalan polarized voting on decryption.
The group of masked separatism supporters held by the anti-excipient police units was distracted by eggs and metal colour in dust, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually floated by tourists.
Later, there were beatings, and the police had to use pendrakes to stop the fights.
The supporters of independence, who cried “without forgetty, without forgiveness, ” faced protesters who supported unity and screamed“Let us live Spain! ”
According to the local media, fourteen people in the protests have received easier injuries.
The year after the referendum of 1 October, which was identified as illegal in Madrid, and the catalonic separists celebrated it, and tensions in the region supporting independence remain.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the participation was low, since the opponents of the deception were largely bouncing the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the continuation of the voting in the region.
Groups supporting independence were camped overnight before the favourites in order to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take the other way.
68-year-old Narcis Termes, an electricist who participated in the separatist protest together with his wife, said that there was no hope that Catalonia would become independent.
“We experienced one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents crying from happiness because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important, although the close victory on regional elections last December, the catalonic parties supporting independence have been difficult to maintain this year, since many of the most famous leaders in voluntary exile or are in custody waiting for a trial due to their role in the organisation of the referendum and later declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanist who recorded a telephone protest in support of the police, explained that the protest was inciting politics on both sides.
"The tension is graduating," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalonic leaders, who are from the end of the last year in custody before the trial, reported that he will run to the European Parliament next year.
"Candidating on European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and oppression that we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: arrested men flying into the house with the car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested for flying into a house in London.
The incident occurred on the street of Ballynagar Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 after the British summer time.
Detective inspector Bob Blemmings said the door was damaged and the building itself.
At some point, we should also shoot against the car with a shot.
Livingston won 1:0 against Rangers.
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston guaranteed a victory
Livingston amazed Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in 18 games as a coach of the Ibrox club.
The shooting of Dolly Mengai took care of the difference, because the team of Gary Holt equated with the Hibernian team in the other place.
The Gerrard's team has lost the guests in this year's championship, and next week the Hearts are waiting for them, leading on the ladder and behind eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston increased his series of imperfection in the division at six runs and main coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted the defeat.
Livingston wasted options against direct guests
Holt's team should have led a lot before the attack, since they caused a number of problems by their immediateness to Rangers.
Scott Robinson made a break, but he sent the ball across the frame of his neck, then Alan Lithgow hit the throat, and Craig Halkett shot his head over the naked.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers because they knew they could be dangerous for guests at the interruption of the attack.
And that's how they got to a key naked.
The Rangers gave Livingstone a free shot and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengai who shot and hit the middle of the penal space.
The Rangers had a larger ball property, but the home defense couldn't be stabbed, and Liam Kelly's doorman had nothing to do.
This sample continued in another half-time, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
The Rangers Rangersov Allan McGregor defended Scott Pittman's shot from his leg, and Lithgow fired from another Livingstone interruption in the attack.
The proposals continued to come to Livingstone's penalty space, but the locals rejected all attacks, two offences – Halkett's offence over the replacement of Glenn Middleton and a hand-going offence — and the judge did not judge.
“Excellent performance” Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena stadium
Excellent show and result for Livingston.
Clearly, they were all excellent and continue to overcome expectations on this way up.
The style of the game and the law has not changed much since they returned to the top, but Holt needs to pay credit for the way he awakened the team since his arrival.
There was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and well arranged a great organized defense, while Menga kept in the readyness of Connor Goldson and Joe Worral.
But the Rangers simply lacked the inspiration.
Although they are excellent under Gerrard’s leadership, these standards are highly deficiencies.
The lack of arrows on the nak – only once they successfully defeated host defense – is a somewhat awake for Rangers who were in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan was adopted mixed in Köln
On Saturday (September 29th), when Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue sky were overcome.
Today is the last day of a controversial visit to President Erdogan in Germany, aimed at improving relations between Nata's allies.
There were disputes on human rights, freedom of press and Turkish accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Köln to open a giant new moshe.
The city is a home for the largest number of Turkish populations outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police have prevented the crowd from gathering before the mosch, but many supporters have managed to come closer to see their president.
A number of hundred protestors also expressed their views -- among them many Kurds -- who do not support the government of Erdogan and condemn Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the divorce of the visitor, which some German Turks celebrate as a hero and others despise as a autocrat.
An accident on the road in Deptford: the bikeman crashed fatally in the car race.
In London, the bike crashed fatally in a race in which the car was involved.
The accident occurred near the crossroad between the streets of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, on the road in Deptford in the southeast of the city at approximately 10.15 after the British summer time.
The car driver stopped and the ambulances came, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred only a few months after the bikeman died in a raid where the car driver fled on the street of Childers Street, approximately a mile from Saturday.
The police have made a statement that the police are checking the identity of the man so they can notify their property.
They set up road jails and redirected the bus lines, and the motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: Six guards damaged in the accident
Six prison guards were injured in the incident in a strictly protected male prison, reports from the prison administration.
The mess exploded in prison HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire on Sunday at approximately 9.30 after the British summer time and is still running.
They called the police specialists from the Tornado unit to provide for the incident in which eight prisoners are involved and are limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with smaller injuries on their face alone.
The representative of the prison staff said: “We have called a specially trained personnel to take care of the incident in prison of HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have suffered injuries.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence and it is clear that the police will be taken responsible for this, and that may make them even longer behind bars."
In prison, HMP Long Lartin is more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
June was reported that the prison manager was in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the police force called to prison to interfere with a serious incident in which the staff was attacked by billboard bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is probably going to happen at the beginning of the next week, since the remaining energy of the Orkan Rosa is putting its way through the southwest of the desert and causing the danger of sudden floods.
The National Time Service has already issued warnings from the sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday to West Arizona, south and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Orkan Rosa was supposed to be pissed off over Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be approaching late on Monday with rain.
The National Time Service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “the ten tropical cyclones kept the status of tropical storms or depression within 300 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
The Orkan of Katrina (1967) was angry about 60 miles from the border of Arizona.”
The latest models of the National Orcan Centre provide for 50 to 100 mm drops with individual drops up to 150 mm in Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including Rockies and Great Basin, it is expected from 25 to 50 mm debris, which is possible for individual drops up to 100 mm.
For areas outside the danger of sudden floods, the rain of the Orkan Rosa may be a blessing, since the region is affected by drought.
Although the floods are a very serious problem, part of the falls will probably be useful, since the dry period currently lasts in the southwest.
“As indicated by the American Drought Tracing Centre, good 40% of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The Orkan Rous leads first to the land of the Mexican Peninsula Baja California.
Rosa, who still has the power of the hurricane on Sunday morning with the highest wind speed of 137 miles per hour, is 620 miles south of Punte Eugenia in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
The storm comes in contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
The land in Mexico is expected to reach by the power of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The falls in Mexico may be abundant and therefore constitute a great danger of floods.
“From Baja California's halfway to the northwest of Sonora, we expect 75 to 150 mm rainfall with a 250 mm rain,” reported on the weather.com website.
The Orkan Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona in early mornings in Tuesday as a tropical depression that will then travel through Arizona and against South Utah until late Tuesday night.
“The biggest danger we expect from the Orkan Ross or his remains is the abundant rain in Baja Califonia in the northwestern Sonore and in the Southwestern Desert of America”, said the National Orkan Centre.
These falls may cause life-rigid sudden floods and floods in deserts and ground plasmas in mountains.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for a murder attempt
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspicion of a murder attempt after they found a 16-year-old in Summerset.
A wounded teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 after British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains “stable”.
17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at the Radstock area at night, reports Avon and Somerset police.
The police are calling everyone who may have caught the event to answer.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “tolered inhumanity and anger” of the Democratic Party
"The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against insmissality and the inexperienced tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the Wheeling Congress in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “has suffered the hostility and anger” of the democratic party in the process of his appointment.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention, denying the prosecution of Christine Blasey Ford clearly and emotionally that he attacked her sexually when they were adolescents.
In the interrogation, she also witnessed Ford's charges.
The President said on Saturday that day “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliantness, quality and courage.”
“The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service”, he told the crowd of supporters in Western Virginia.
The President mentioned the appointment of Kavanaugh directly when he spoke of the importance of the vote of the Republicans in interim elections.
“For five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm really trying with the candidacy," he said.
“I therefore fight everywhere for excellent candidates.”
Trump argues that democrats are on the “opposition and obstacles” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Cavanaugh appointment Senate was to take place at Friday at the latest, CNN advisor of the Republican Party told the CNN.
In the Indonesian earthquake and cunamium of hundreds of people killed, the number of victims grows
The authorities reported on Saturday that at the earthquake and the cunamie affected by the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people died, many of the giant waves that were at the coast.
Several hundred people gathered on Friday at a beach festival in Palu, when six - meters of waves at the dark side of the coast and took many to death and destroyed everything on their way.
Cunami followed the earthquake with the power of 7.5 degrees.
“When there was a cunamic danger yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they became victims," said the representative of the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Mitigation BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at the meeting in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn't come alone, he dragged with him cars, trees, houses, he smashed everything on the ground”, explained Nugroho and added that he traveled tsunami across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
He said that some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
Approximately 16.700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palui.
The air photographs published by the Agency for Disasters show destroyed buildings and stores, scrambled and broken bridges and moshes.
The earthquakes continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
In a area of 2.4 million people, there was a variety of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) stated in the statement that the energy released in the Friday strong earthquake is approximately 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geography of the city laying at the end of the long and narrow bay should further increase the size of the cunamie.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive ” and said that many thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were destroyed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found captured under the ruins of buildings, and he added, 540 people were damaged and 29 still missing.
Nugroho explained that the victims and damage may be bigger near the coast 300 km north of Paluja, in the area of Donggala, near the epicentre of the earthquake.
As Nugroha also said, communications are completely discontinued and do not have any information from the Dongal area.
“In the area more than 300,000 people live” said in the statement of the Red Cross and added that staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
“It's a tragedy, but it can get worse” they said.
On Saturday, the Agency received numerous criticisms because it did not inform the public that the tsunami affected Palo, but the officials say the waves arrived at the time of the issue of the warning.
In the amateur video published on social networks, there is a hearing that a man on the top floor screams warns people on the street on the nearby tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall ran along the coast and took away buildings and cars.
In Reuters, they were unable to immediately confirm the competence of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused the decline of electricity that has interrupted the communications around Palui, which is causing the authorities to be difficult to coordinate rescue action.
The authorities report that the army has started sending cargo planes through Jacarda and other cities, but the evacuated still need food and other basic life needs.
The local airport was open only to provide aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation centres in Palui on Sunday.
The number of victims in the Indonesian cunami has increased to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Dosebe, members of the World Vision Organization from Donghala arrived safely in Palo, where employees in the courtyard had built a shelter from their rooms, but they saw many scenes of desolation on their way.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups launched disaster aid initiatives, some complainted that foreign humanitarian workers with a lot of experience did not allow arrival in Palo.
In accordance with Indonesian Regulations, oversea financing, stocks and assistance of staff are permitted only if the scene of the accident is declared for the area of national disaster.
That hasn't happened before.
“It is still considered an accident at the province level”, said Aulia Ariani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says “all right, this is a national accident”, we can accept international assistance, but it is not yet.”
The other night after Friday’s earthquake and the cunamie in Paluo, friends and relatives of the missing ones have hoped that their neighbouring miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled the boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescueers released a woman who was caught under ruins for two days, and the body of her mother lied there.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian Nuclear Falling Representative, trained two missing sailing droppers for Asia games that ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Others, captured in the Roa Roa Hotel, said Mr. Mandagi were his students.
“As an age in the field of sailing fall, I bear my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that in the hours when the news about the crash of the hotel Roa Roa circled around the sailing desperate community, he sent messages in despair to whatsApp competitors in Palui who attended the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one grey key, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered” he said.
Thieves stole 26.750 USD during the filling of bankomates in Newport Centre on the Levee
After reporting the Newport police, the robbers stolen 26.750 USD from the Brink Security Officer who filled a bankomate in Newport on the Leeve on Friday morning.
The car driver was emptying the bankomate in the entertainment complex and preparing for money delivery, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a public statement.
While he was employed, another man “closed to the employee of Brink’s security from behind ” and stole the bag of money for supplies.
Following the report, the witnesses saw several suspects flee from the scene, but the police did not specify the exact number of participating in the event.
Everyone who has information on the identity of the suspects should call the Newport police number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name – to Ye.
The change reported on Saturday on Twitter and wrote: “Bying with official name Kanye West.”
41-year-old West has a name Ye for a while and has also used it to address his eighth album issued in June.
The amendment comes right before his show in the Saturday Night Live show, in which I should present my new album Yandhi.
He will replace Ariano Grande's singer, who canceled the show for “personal reasons”, said the producer of the show.
The word declines his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means “you” (e.g. ti),” West said at the beginning of this year when he spoke about the album address to the Big Boy Radio host.
“So I am you and I are all of us.
Kanye, which means "edini", I transformed into Ye – that reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are."
Kanye is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his wish for the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West colleague, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with thought or without it and with large letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised that he would not use the army against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador oathed that he would never use military forces against civilians as soon as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on the Tlatelolco Plaza market that “he would never use the army to harass the Mexican people.”
At the time the left student movements started in Latin America, on the peaceful demonstration market on October 2, 1968, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador swears to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly subsidies and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education brings young people into criminal associations.
United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
Since China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds spent for research in this area, the investor and expert on the art intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after the various parts of the American government foretold the use of artificial intelligence, although the United States has no official strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best innovation in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Duplicate budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, since all other countries are quite for the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
The double funding could double the possibility of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in the interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (Supersile Art Intelligence: China, Silician Valley and New World Order) published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, chairman of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most visible companies for artistic intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, the University of Carnegie Mellon developed a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the highest American player in the game Othello and later was the executive director in Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said he was aware of the previous technological competitions of the American government, such as the robotic competition organized by the DARPA Agency (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when the next time he would find the next visioners.
Researchers in the United States have to work hard to receive state support, Lee said.
“It is not the China that takes over the best academy, but these are companies,” Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired the best from universities in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to strengthen efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I think that we should offer a green card automatically to persons with a doctor from artificial intelligence”, he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of the new generation.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences finances people in academic institutions, like the National Scientific Foundation and other government organizations, divide money to American researchers, but the quality of the academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established the Joint Intelligence Centre, which combines partners from the industrial and academic sector, and the White House announced the establishment of a stronger committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, however, the DARPA Agency foretold an investment in the AI Next initiative of two billion USDs.
The National Scientific Foundation (NSF) in artificial intelligence research currently invests more than 100 million USD per year
Meanwhile, the American legislation that wanted to create the National Security Commission for Art Intelligence has not done anything for months.
Macedonians will decide on a change in the country's name at the referendum
The Macedonian citizens voted on the referendum on Sunday, whether they would change their country's name into the "Republic of North Macedonia" and thus resolved the decades of long dispute with Greece, which opposed their request for membership in the European Union and Nate.
Greece, which has its province named Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and put veto on its entry into Nato and the EU.
On June, the government concluded a new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote at the referendum, and the boycot campaign expressed doubt that the participation would be at least 50 as far as necessary to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum list was: “Are you for membership in Nata and the EU with Greece?”
The supporters of the referendum, including the President of the Government, Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying for the accession of bodies such as the EU and Nato, to Macedonia, one of the countries emerging after the breakdown of Yugoslavia.
I have come today to vote for the future of the country and young people in Macedonia to live freely under the scope of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament said that they would respect the results of the vote that would be decided.
Change of the name requires a two-third majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission notified that there were no irregularities reported until 13:00.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our town is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje's capital.
The Macedonian President of the Government Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and Dusko's son in Strumica, in Macedonia on 30 September 2018, submitted their referendum referendum in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country that opens the way to the accession of Nat and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set by those who will bounce the referendum.
"We are for Nato and the EU, but we want to join with the heads raised, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the eurosian integration."
The President of the Government, Zaev, says that membership in Nata will bring a strongly necessary investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and then," Zaev said after the delivery of his election sheet.
He added that a positive result would be “the confirmation of our future”.
The survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research has shown that the referendum would be part of 30 to 43 percent of the voters, which is less than the necessary electoral participation.
The second survey carried out by the Macedonian Television Telma showed that 57 percent of the questionnaires would be voted on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote for.
In order to succeed the referendum, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious strike to the policy of the Western government, which took over the mandate last May.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has lost the whole Brighton defense and target
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense at Manchester City victory with 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in England.
Aguer's hit in the 65th minute seemed ridiculous.
At the beginning of the action, the Argentine attacker accepted the presentation in the middle of the playground.
He fled between the three Brighton defense players and found an open space.
Aguera then surrounded four green players.
He lost one defense player and was faster than the other on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he gave Sterling his left.
The English attacker, with his first touch in the penal area, returned the ball to Aguer, who defeated Brighton's right leg and sent the ball to the right side of the network.
"Aguero faces problems in his feet," Coach City Pep Guardiola told the journalists.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he hit a naked at that point."
But Sterling was the one who provided the blue to the wise, the initial advantage in the fighting of the first English League.
The naked came in 29 minutes.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deeply at Brighton's half.
He handed the ball on his left hand to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball several times and then sent the ball to Sterling against a remote necklace.
The Blue Blue attacker threw the ball into the net just before he flew through the naked.
On Tuesday at 12,55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Aren Stadium, Sinsheim, Germany, in the group part of the League of Championships, will meet with Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies and spoil their address options
The Nationals team fell out of the end, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always a contestant Scherzer hopes that on Sunday will be able to go up on a metal grid against Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if Rockies still have a chance to play at the end, since they have a game game in the West League before the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
Rockies won 5:2 on Friday over the Nationals team provided the least invitation of the organizer, but they are still waiting for their first address in the division.
"Although we can't get anything, at least we can play in a great environment in front of a great crowd here in Denver and the opposite team will play at the probably highest level this year.
So why don't you want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet published the names of the first metal in Sunday, but it will probably be the Scherzer metal in this case.
Scherzer, who's going to metal this first 34 times, has been metaled as a burden player on Thursday, and he'd have enough days to rest by Sunday.
The Washington rightman gathered this season 18 victories and 7 defeats with an average of 2,53 and 300 examinations with strokes in 220 2/3 changing this season.
Trump at meetings in Western Virginia
The President directly touched the situation on his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of the Republican election participation in interim elections.
"All we've done will be on the end of November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I really try to candidate, so I fight everywhere for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “We have this horrible, horrible, radical group of democrats, and this is happening now.
They're determined to take over the power again, using all the resources they can use.
They do not care whom they hurt, whom they must be slaughtered to receive power and control; because they want, power and control, but we will not give it to them."
According to him, democrats are on the mission of “opposition and obstacles”.
“And you could have noticed this in the last four days,” he said, and he called the democrats “anger, evil, low and liar”.
He exposed the member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, with a loud disapproval from the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I'm not, wait. This was really a bad voice of the body, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The labour client is no longer open for different views.
She is impatient to those who express their opinions.
When an activist of the Momentum organization in my local client said untrusted to me, it wasn't a surprise.
Finally, I am the last member of the parliamentary party that is not desirable to express my opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, happened similarly because she strongly resisted anti-semitism.
In my case, there was an untrusted proposal for my unconfidentiality with Jeremy Corbyn.
As regards the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and ironicly similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a Friday meeting of the Labour Party Nottingham East, it stated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
In eight years, as far as I am a member of the Parliament of the local labour party, Friday meetings were mostly the same.
Today, most of the meetings are not used by such tonnes and the promise of “better and gentle” policy has been forgotten for a long time if it has ever even started.
It is increasingly clear that different views in the labour party are not allowed and in each opinion it is assessed whether this is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and the colleagues I thought before we were sharing similar political views were expecting me to change my opinion and take my views that I would never agree with -- that this would be in the field of national security or the EU's single market.
When I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - there are criticisms on social networks that call for non-election, condemn the environment policy and tell me that I should not be in a labourist party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments for me are only political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who meet each day with the flood of sexist or racist insults, but do not let them be scared.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how abuse rates have become more common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the labour party must promote the culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and, with every proposal of an untrusted or changing the rules for the choice of a client, it becomes more harmful.
In the last two years, I have received many advice to remove my head and not to be so loud, but it will be “all right. ”
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since 32 years ago, as a student, I joined the Laborist Party – the reason for this was Tatcher's government's lack of care, which has literally caused the classroom in my primary school — I have tried to take advantage of better public services for those most needed.
I never hid my political beliefs, including the last elections.
No one at the Nottingham East party could be confused about my political positions and areas that I disagreed with the current leadership.
Those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I don't understand their wishes after wasting time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the labour party when the country swims against the brexite that hurts households, companies and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, whether they are members of the labour party or not: I am proud that I have served you, and I promise you that no threats after no choice or political suitableness will distract me from acting in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr to the top of the ladder
Two knowing attempts have screwed up a little bit of the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a victory in this wonderful entertainment championship of the day.
Now they're on the top of the ladder and they're the only invincible team of ten.
In the end, their high defense and better exploitation, and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
"We have passed many tests in our current matches, and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “Congratulations to the Ayra team, opportunities have been better than us. ”
The attack of Granta Andersona in the 14th minute converted by Frazier Climo led Ayr to the leadership, but the yellow card for the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, which he received in the Warriors game, meant a number of overpowers for Melrose and Jason Baggott, had crossed an attempt without conversion.
Climo increased the leadership for Ayra at the offence, before he hit at half an hour and then turned an independent attempt for the result 17:5 for Ayr at tire.
But Melrose started very well the second half and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the remnant to five points.
It followed a long interruption due to the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, taken on the weapons, and afterwards, Ayr made progress with the attempt of Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
The temporary captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow card and Melrose again used the game with a player more with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the period of forced pressure.
But the hosts came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because of Clim's obstacle without ball, MacPherson reached an assault.
Climo reached the point after Kyle Rowe shot David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's wing player in the fifth host attempt.
The Still Game Star starts a new career in the guest
The star of the Still Game Ford Kieran is apparently presented to the guest, but he is supposed to be the director of the licensed company with restaurants.
A 56-year-old in the popular BBC series, for which he also wrote a scenario, played Jack Jarvis with a long-year-old partner in comedies Greg Hemphill.
Two of them announced that after the next ninth season, the last season, and it seems Kiernan has already planned life through Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, the Director of Adriftmorn Limited is.
The player did not want to comment on the story, but the source for Scottish Sun implied that Kiernan wanted to be included in the "blooming guest" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Navy patrols on the seat in La Paz.
In public buildings, the navy blue flags are exclusive.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaka to Amazon are covered with slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to return it."
In continental Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute due to natural sources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive — as the desire for a renewed swimming through the Pacific.
This hope may be the greatest after decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a decision of the International Court, which will be received on October 1st after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has a launch, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, expects a result in a positive spirit," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the international court's decisions on large screens across the country and hope that the Hague Court will decide to award Bolivia, which claims that after decades of non-constantial talks – the Chile will negotiate the access of Bolivia to sovereign access to the sea.
Here Morales, the Bolivian carismatic native president, who is waiting for a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has great expectations on Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," promised the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not decide on the benefit of Bolivia — and even if it were, it would not have changed much.
The United Nations authorities in the Netherlands are not authorised to allocate Bolivia the Chilean territory and will not decide on the results of possible conversations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court comes only six months after the final arguments were heard, means that the case was “not complex”, said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert for international law.
And for the last four years, they don't speak in the benefit of Bolivia, but they may cost a lot.
"The current Bolivian government has used the question of access to the sea," Zaratova said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric clustered all the goodwill that might still remain.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at a point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the debate.
The states have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in Hague, rejected the idea that the court had decided unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring a “excellent opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “closing 139-year disagreements with mutual benefits”, he said.
Calzadilla also denyed that Morales — still one of the most popular Latin American presidents — used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to discern that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea stated that nuclear disarmament would not happen if the U.S. can't trust
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people will never first destroy their nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
Ri had a talk on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He invited the United States to fulfil their promises made at the meeting between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes in time when US Minister Mike Pompeo is obviously before the restart of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead point, more than three months after the meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
It says that the United States is wrong if they think that the continuation of sanctions and the objection of the prophecy of the end of Korean war will bring North Korea to their knees.
Washington is cautious with the prophecy, without Pjongjang to take decisive measures first to disarmament.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is general doubt that Pjongjang is serious about the cancellation of the weapons that the country sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongjang next month to prepare everything for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
In the fashion magazines in Paris, the latest line of huge covers coming to a pricemark trade in your neighborhood
If you want to complete your cover collection or hide completely from the sun, you do not need to search forward.
Valentino and Thom Browne have discovered in their spring collections and summer 2019 on the fashion track a collection of miraculous overwhelms that blinded the style on the Paris week of mode.
Very unpractical covers flooded Instagram this summer, and the designers sent their spectacular creations to the fashion.
The valentine's most exhausted part was a hat in a bež color with wide paws decorated by feather similar supplements in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other too large fashion additives included lumps with expensive stones, a wizard hat and even ananas — but your heads will not warm.
Thom Browne also showed the choice of bizarre masks — the right time for the night of the witches.
Many colored masks have sewed lips and are more similar to the masks of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creative was similar to melting equipment with breathing and glasses, and the other looked like a melted ice cream corn.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion fashionists predict that the giant covers will come to the stores close to you.
The broad hats closely follow the “La Bombi”, a slippery hat with 60-centimetric shoes, including the Rihanna and Emily Ratajkovski.
The cultural mark for the extremely unpractical hat that flooded the social networks sent another large creative after the fashion line — a slammed beach bag that was almost as large as a model in the baths she had wearing.
The bag from the rafia in a burned orange color, processed with rafia and handling of white skin, was on the Paris week of the central piece of the La Riviera collection of the Jacquemus for spring/svenge 2019.
The Style of the famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and bags to arrive in the shops for the next summer – since the designer made such a strong impression, the request for too many supplements would be difficult to overlook.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is crucial for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools enjoy the celebration of the academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of exceptional results on tests strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scotland Council for independent schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Individual schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the selected occupational path and the city they have as global citizens.
As the education sector that can form and implement a adjusted school programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable selection objects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, the conversation is impressed in his memory.
But if you speak to a man in his mother’s tongue, the words go into his heart. ”
This is a good reminder that we must not rely only on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
The results of recent tests show that the languages are at the top of the scale with the highest level of performance in independent schools.
68 percent of the students learning a foreign language have reached an excellent assessment.
The data collected in 74 schools of the Scotland Council for independent schools (SCIS) showed that 72 per cent of the students had reached an excellent assessment in Mandarin, and 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French and 63 per cent of Spanish students received excellent evaluation.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the key knowledge that children and young people will need in the future.
Languages are treated as a selective object in independent schools and in other cases as subjects in the areas of naturalism, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The study carried out by the Commission for the Employment and Training of the United Kingdom in 2014 showed that, for reasons why employers are concerned to fill their free jobs, 17 percent are attributable to lack of language knowledge.
Therefore, knowledge of languages becomes increasingly urgent in preparing young people for their future vocational path.
In future employment opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, no matter what professional way he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can directly communicate with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage before competition.
YouGov’s 2013 survey showed that 75% of the people were not speaking the foreign language enough to talk, with the only French language spoken by the bilateral percentage of the questioned persons.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for children today.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing economies, children have better opportunities to find appropriate employment.
In Scotland, schools differ in languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others learn languages that are supposed to be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, you will always be able to choose a number of languages learned by experts in this area in independent schools.
Scotland's independent schools are dedicated to the provision of a educational environment that will prepare and arm children with the knowledge they need for success, regardless of what the future brings.
In the global business environment, it is not possible to deny that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Individual schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scotland Council of Self-School Schools.
LeBron will debit Sunday in San Diego in Lakers' dress
For the fans who look forward to the first LeBron James show for the Los Angeles Lakers team, the waiting will soon be over.
Coach of Lakers' Luke Walton foretold that James will play in the Sunday Pressian Pressure against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
“More than one and less than 48,” explained Walton on the official web site of Lakers.
The official rapporteur of Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers flows before the season.
"In this stage, I don't need my career to prepare before the season," he said.
Trump Congress in Western Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts a series of conventions in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump's five planned conventions next week, including the stations in its favored countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a free place in the Supreme Court is not yet confirmed, Trump wants to acquire support for the coming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatened by the loss of control of Congress after the November vote.
At which hour will Trump’s Congress in West Virginia, and where will it be available online?
The Trump Congress in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be on Saturday, 29 September 2018, at 19:00 a.m. after east time.
The Trump Congress in Western Virginia can be seen live on the YouTube channel.
Trump will probably talk about the hearing of the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh this week, which has become tense about sexual offence charges, which is why the confirmation in the Senate is expected to be delayed for a week to conduct a investigation by the FBI.
However, the primary goal of this series of conventions is to help the Republicans who are waiting for important elections in November to acquire a new start.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trump of these five conventions, “the encouragement of volunteers and supporters, since the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, reports Reuters.
"The oversight in the Congress is so important for his programme that the president will travel to as many countries as possible in the severe season of campaigns," Reuters told the representative of Trump's campaign that does not want to be appointed.
Today's Congress in Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, the West Virginia MetroNews Radio, would also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, which would attract the interest in the pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, in which he received more than 40 percent of points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who remains in public research.
"For Morrisey it is a bad sign that the president has to arrive in public research," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters' report.
Ryder's Scoot 2018: U.S. team has still a desire for victory and maintains hope before Sunday's individual fights
After three one-sided games, the Saturday afternoon fights of two two (foursome) may have been what Ryder's yearly cocktail needed.
The decreasing rival is an entirely invented sport concept, but players really believe it, especially in such competitions.
So, where did it go now?
“They had six points of advantage, and now they have four, so it's probably a new start for us” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, as it leads to four points, but 12 can get them.
But, according to Spieth’s words, the Americans feel that they have the wind in the sails, including the forms of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and won three points of four.
Spieth was destined from the starting strike to the vegetable and gave a good example.
The screaming of happiness continued to be louder and led to a decisive strike, when Thomas and I retained two points in the fourth game.
The punch that brought them a win on the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream that lets you know that the American team believes that the American team still has a chance.
“You just need to find your internal strength and focus on your game”, said Spieeth.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to the glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a disputed story of Ryder's cocktail.
Unusual, but charming two Europes won four points of four and are unlawful.
Two “Molliwood” were the only ones who did not hit a bug on Saturday afternoon and also avoided the bugi on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way that apparently the flow of energy between them and the noisy public confirms the fact that they are those players to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could seal better the possible victory of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun comes over the Le Golf National field.
It's possible that both of them are on different holes at the same time.
However, talking about European glory would be early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergei Garcia, the morning hero in a game with four balls who were together with Alex Norren.
Because of the bug and two double bugs in the first nine holes, Spain and Sweden have fallen into a crisis from which they have not found a way out.
But the players won't have any help on Saturday.
Games with four balls and two fights are exceptionally interesting to monitor from nearby due to communication between couples, advice they give, advice that they do not give, and how the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has so far played better than the team and has a great advantage before the last day, but the two two fights have shown that the U.S. team also has a desire to win, and some, especially on the American side, have doubts.
Europe leads 10:6 before Ryder's last day
Europe goes on the last day of Ryder's Mount with a fine privilege after after the Saturday games with four balls and the fights of two two leads with 10:6 to the United States.
The excellent couple composed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made his best and with two victories over Tiger Woods and on Le Golf National playground, took four points out.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to win the trophy that she lost in Hazeltin two years ago, had four balls of power over the American team that sinned, and said in a series of 3:1 in the morning.
The U.S. team fought better in two fights, where two games were won, but the removal could not be compensated.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from the Sunday 12 individual fights if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newsletter who won four sequences, while the Molinari (a couple called Molliwood) after the sensational end of the week only another couple who won four points in his first four games in Ryder's history.
After the winning of Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four balls, they turned themselves again and even more persuasively defeated by the lost Woods and the US newsman Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliantness for a moment, but lost 19 out of 29 games in fights with four balls and two fights, of that seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning games with four balls, returned to the fights of two two two and in a couple with Henrik Stanson with 2 and 1 defeated Dustina Johnson and Broox Koeopka, who were classified in the first and third place on the world’s ladder.
But on a pleasant, wind day in the southwest of Paris, it was not all according to the European team's plans.
The three winners of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set up a new criterion for the Americans on Saturday.
With 2 and 1, they strongly won against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game with four balls and then returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in the fights of two two, losing the first two holes.
Only once in Ryder's history, the team came back after the four-point removal in front of individual fights, even though Furyk's team needs only an equation to keep the trophy.
But after two days in the second place, the Sunday Anti - Attack may seem too much for her.
North Korea: “Without confidence, we will never disarma the unilateral weapons”
The North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that the further implementation of sanctions caused increasing non-confidence in the United States of America and that North Korea, under such conditions, will certainly not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jong Ho, at the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this World Authority, said that North Korea has adopted many “significant measures in the sign of goodwill”, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile experiments, the season for nuclear attempts and the promise that they will not spread nuclear weapons and technology.
“But we do not see the appropriate response of the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we will not be sure of state security, and under such conditions we will never disarma ourselves unanimously first.”
While Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, which would be awarded by North Korea for the adoption of progressive measures, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject the unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongjang did in the past.
Ri was linked to a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump from the first top between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader, which took place on 12 June in Singapore. At that time, Kim pledged to seek “nuclear disarmament of the Korean hemisphere” while Trump North Korea promised security security.
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean war, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said that Pjongjang must first renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington also did not give up the invitations to release the strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
“The United States persist in the first nuclear disarmament and increase the pressures of sanctions to achieve their goals by force and even object to the announcement of the end of the war”, said Ri.
“When he thinks that sanctions can get us on his knees, it's an unrealistic hope of people who don't even know us.
The problem is, however, that the further implementation of sanctions continues to deepen our untrustedness."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US President exposed at the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Mun Je Ina, which took place in the past five months, and added: “If the problem of nuclear disarmament had been discussed with South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean hemisphere would not agree to such a dead point.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from that last year, when the General Assembly of the United Nations said that the attack on the U.S. continental part of the United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable after the “gospodine of the wicked president” Trump Kim was called a “rake man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened to “destroy fully” North Korea, commended Kim in the United Nations congregation and his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said he was still waiting for a lot of work and that sanctions must remain valid until North Korea is nuclearly disarmaded.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no anticipated timeframe for this, and said: “The time may take two years, three or five months — that does not matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the measures taken.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council: “The sanctions of the Security Council must continue firmly without exceptions until we recognize the complete, final and verified state of nuclear disarmament. ”
Since 2006, the Security Council has coherently accepted additional sanctions for North Korea in order to prevent the financing of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rio at the edge of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pjongjang would visit again the next month for preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When Pyongjang left July, he stated that progress had been made, and in a few hours North Korea has criticised him to be “gangster” his requirements.
At a meeting with Mun, which took place in this month, North Korea has committed itself to undermine the missile test station and the nuclear test infrastructure if the United States adopt “suitable measures”.
Munu was supposed to say that with “suitable measures”, the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and the measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Students of the Harvard University attend a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest
The aim of the new year's course at the Harvard University is to teach all diploma students how to afford more sleep. With such a course, they want to fight the growing crochetic culture of “celonight” teaching, where the powers are collected with caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world’s best university often do not know the basis for care for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a sleep professor at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Women's Hospital, has formed a course that is his first type in the United States.
In order to implement such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of the lack of sleep on learning.
After the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, “Why am I to know it just now when I am in the last year? ”
She said no one ever told her how important a sleep is.
The course they conduct for the first time this year refers to the key importance of good bedroom habits for study and sports success, as well as to improving the general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatric professor at the Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university health services, says that they have decided for such a course when they found that the students are lacking sleep during the week.
The Enourn course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, a picture of the neck of the student's home where students can click on coffee glasses, curtains, sports copate and books to obtain information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleeping on sports success and the importance of the sleeping routine.
In the second section, participants find that long-term sleep shortages may increase the risk of heart failure, brain drop, depression and cancer.
The map of the student settlement with the interactive icons of the participants encourages to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that the conduct of students will not be changed immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health affects smoking cigarettes,” adds Professor Cheisler.
Professor says that the culture of pride in “living all night learning” is still present. It also adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students, resulting in the lack of sleep, are increasing problems.
Professor Cheisler says that enough quality sleep should be “the secret weapons” of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety. This also prevents the acquisition of weight — the brains, because of the lack of sleep, are familiar with hunger, which is why students are constantly hungry.
The 19-year-old California student of chemistry and physical biology Raymond So helped professor Cheisler to develop a course. Last year, during the first year at Harvard, he attended one professor's lecture.
He says that his lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student settlement.
He hopes that at the next stage of the sub-diploma students will be able to ask for a similar study programme to be completed before they join the competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students set up a sleeping buddy as well as awakening. He also wishes to warn them of the harmful effects of the "wise light" transmitted by electronic screens and LED-lighting, as they can cause the imbalance of the circadiatic rhythm, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hit drowned upe Gerrard's team
Rangers again defeated in guests: Dolly Menga in Livingstone, the proclaimed team Steven Gerrard condemned to defeat with 1 : 0.
The Ibrox team has been hunting its first guest victory after February's victory at St. Johnstone stadium with 4 : 1 , but the team of Gary Holt has given her second defeat in 18 matches since Gerrard was headed, with which his team for the leading team of the Scotland League remains 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the expiry of the first half of the time, and the chosen species of Rangers had no impression that he wanted to equate.
The Rangers had fallen to a frequent place, and Livingston progressed to the third place, but with the difference of goals, the team of Hibernian was behind.
The problem of the Rangers was not over. Calum Spence, a side judge, suffered a head injury when he came from the city of the cheerleader's guest team after his report.
Gerrard, in the crew, who conquered Ayr without trouble and entered into the Betfred Cup half-finals, performed eight shifts.
On the other hand, Holt held up to the verified Livingstone, who took the point to the Hearts team a week ago, and he was undoubtedly impressed by how his escaped team effectively neutralized all guest attempts.
Rangers had a higher ball property, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity arrived for two minutes after Menga was found by Scott Pittman with the first short show, and then he went to Allan McGregor's naked, but the connection was untouched and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but then his defense assistant Alan Lithgow failed to go.
In the last third, the Rangers took over control, but the game showed more hope than a real desire for victory.
Alfredo Morelos was quite convinced that after the race with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the competition, a punishment shot should be reached, but Judge Steven Thomson had wiped the Colombian's demand in the challenging.
In the first half, the Rangers were able to compose only two arrows on the naked, but not a head shot sent against the naked Lassan Coulibaly, nor a floating ball of Ovie Ejari, were no dangers for Liam Kelly's gateway.
Livingstone’s introductory goal may have surprised everything in the 34th minute, but he has already been fully earned because of his endurance.
The Rangers failed to remunerate another Jacobs continuation with a long submission.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who rutinally prepared Mengi a show for a simple end of the attack.
Gerrard acted and, during Coulibaly's vacation, switched with a wing player Ryan Kent, who immediately showed up with Morrelos, but Kelly effectively came from his line and blocked the attack.
Nevertheless, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, while Lithgow and Halkett took care of more passages before the naked.
Holt's team could also increase the leadership at the end of the competition, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was untouched after the angle.
In Rangers, Glenn Middleton received a chance for a punishment shot after contacting Jacobs, but Judge Thomson didn't admit it.
Almanah: Inventor of Geiger's numberer
We present a page from the almanach of our Sunday editions: on September 30, 1882, so on this day more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm was born in Germany, “Hans” Geiger, who later became a worldly famous physicist.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactiveness, and this invention was the basis for the development of a device named Geiger's numerator.
In the scientific world, he became a standing station, and he also received his place in pop-cultural, for example, in a film “Bells of Coronado” in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is Geiger's number. It is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear your listeners, you can hear the effect on the atoms of radioactiveness in materials.”
Evans: “Madonca, but now they are really advertising! ”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before 63th birthday.
But the invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify attack cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify attack cells and destroy them
Therapeutic vaccine teaches the immune system to identify the attack cells
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells of patients that are subsequently modified in the laboratory
After that, they may see protein characteristic of many cancer forms and then be returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancer diseases.
In one of the women receiving a vaccine that taught the immune system to identify the attack cells, the cancer on eggs disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes the acquisition of immune cells of patients transformed into the lab to "see" the HER2 protein which is characteristic to many forms of cancer and then inject again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the American National Institute for Cancer Research in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine. ”
HER2 “incentives the growth of several different types of cancer”, including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and fat wombs.
Similar approach to the acquisition of immune cells of patients who are “learned” to target cancer cells has also worked in treatment with the type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after the SNL appearance, performed a protrumming point with the MAGA inscription on the hat.
Municipality was not thrilled
Kanye West was squeezed in the Saturday Night Live studio by a miraculous point where he expressed support to the US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 will be searched for the presidential chair.
After the end of the event, the third song of his show called “Ghost Town”, in which he was wearing a hat with the inscription“Make America Great Again”, West started attacking democrats and reiterated his support to Trump.
“I often talk to a white-pool person and he says, ‘How can you like Trump, but he's a racist? ’
"Well, if I was concerned about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago," he says.
This SNL show began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood player departed from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Commission for Justice in the Senate which Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologist was not played, but it was loaded by a comic Chris Rock in the social network.
It's not known if Rock was going to make fun of it from West.
West, among others, complained to the public that he had some difficulties in the hat.
"They came after me after the sandwich.
They told me, "Don't go to the stage with this hat."
I've been harassed!
And they say I'm lost," says Washington Examiner's report.
West continued: “Do you want to see the lost scene?” and added that he had to put on “Superman's cap, because that means no one can command me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His comments prepared the public to whistle at least twice, and the members of the SNL team were obviously disturbed, and someone said to Vanity: “In the studio there was death silence. ”
West was invited to replace a goat for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boy, raper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has caused many surprises with a video spot for the song “I Love it”, where he was wearing a bottle of mineral water marks Perrier.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the leader of the TPUS Conservative Group, which Twittered: “One of the most brave souls: THANK YOU HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAPPENED.”
The director of the talk show, Karen Hunter, Twittered that West is simple “what it is, and that is absolutely fine.
However, I will NOT reward someone (with buying his music, clothing or supporting his “arts”), who, in my opinion, greets and extends ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And we also," she added.
Before the show, the raper on Twitter announced that he changed his name and then he will be “being formally known as Kanye West. Now I am YE.”
He's not the first musician who decided to change his name. He's already done it before him, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His housing colleague Snoop Dogg once called Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name into a symbol and then he was an artist known as Prince.

Kit Harrington's throne game star acted sharply against toxic manhood
Kit Harrington is known by his sword intake in the role of Jona Snow in HBO's exciting medium-secretly colored fantasy series Game of thrones.
A 31-year-old player who condemned a stereotype of a macitic hero says that because of the appearance of such roles in screened young boys often feel that respect can be earned only with hard life.
The Sunday Times Culture said that in his opinion, something was wrong, and he wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic men during the movement period #JazTudi.
A player who recently married a 31-year-old companion from Rose Leslie's throne game admitted that he has strong beliefs in this subject.
"I am personally seriously wondering at the moment where we made a mistake when there is a manship," he said.
“What have we taught men about the problems we are facing now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing the toxic manness for showing very husbandly characters.
He continued: “What is born and learned?
What do they teach us on television and on the streets that young boys feel that they have to choose this certain pay for manship?
I think one of the important issues of our time is how can we change it?
Because apparently there was something wrong with young men.”
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series of summer, he would not participate in the recording of any prediction or continuation of the throne Game because he “confided with battles and horses”.
In November, Kit will play the main role of the new show of True West Sam Shepard, which is a story about the film producer and his brother's thief.
The player recently discovered that the best thing that happened because of the throne Game, was that he met his wife Rose at the record.
"For this series, I met my wife, so she kind of gave me my future family and life from here," he said.
Rose was in the fantasy series, rewarded with Emmy, playing Ygritte, the lovely elector of the Kit's character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/aids: from China, 14% increase in new cases
China announced 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS virus.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases have been reported.
In a major majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted with sexual relations, which represents a change in comparison with the past.
Usually HIV was rapidly spread in some parts of China due to the transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to the data of Chinese health officials from the province province province Junan, the number of people infected by HIV has been reduced to almost nothing.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS is still increasing by 100 000 people per year in China.
Transfer of HIV with sexual relations in the Chinese LGBT community is a very dry problem.
Homosexuality has been decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination from the LGBT community is still very present.
As conservative values are still applicable in the country, 70 to 90% of the men who have sexual relations with men are eventually married to a woman.
The disease is frequently transmitted because of inappropriate protection in sexual relations in such situations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government, as part of the efforts to solve the problem, has promised that the overall access to HIV-treatment medicinal products will be available.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff has issued information on the Republican Senators, the convictions of "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
On Saturday, US Congresswoman Maxine Waters rejected the accusations that a member of her staff published information on three American Republican Senators on their Wikipedia website.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that these charges came from individuals and web sites of the extreme right.
"Lies, lies and more unacceptable lies," Waters wrote in the Twitter statement.
The published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Caroline and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
Those data have appeared online on Thursday, whereas the unknown person with Capitol Hill published by the Senate on the sexual obsection of a candidate for the Supreme Judge, Brett Kanaugh.
The information was declined after the three senators concluded with Kavanaugh's interrogation.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicate that through the IP address the source of the publication that is supposed to be linked to the office of Senator Waters and to conclude that information was published by a personnel, still reports Hill.
“This unfounded accusations are completely wrong and pure lies” continues Waters.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are in danger because of these false accusations, are not responsible for the deployment of these data.
These unfounded accusations are completely unreal and pure lies.”
The statement of Senator Waters quickly encountered criticisms online, including the former representative of the White Press House, Ari Fleischer.
“After this denial of anger”, wrote Fleischer.
"This may mean that it is not from the right test for the Congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he can't show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the one he accused him.
It must remain calm."
Fleischer compared Waters' response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a republic candidate, who is searching for the city of Waters in the interim elections, called through Twitter.
“If this is true, it is serious”, he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her cabinet informed the “suitable institutions and bodies of persecution regarding these false charges.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be disclosed,” she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for suggestions on Brexit in any new British film has already become traditional, and it also applies to the recovery of the Johnny English Action Comedy, which was first arrived in 2003 with Johnny English addressed and continued in 2011 entitled Johnny English 2.
Will it be a fun satir on how bad we are, a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English with exhausted eyes and unusual grimas gets permission to mix the screws again; his name already indicates that it is a comic character created for a movie audience in non-English speaking areas.
It is an unnatural secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains part of Clouseau, Mr Bean's cluster and the smallness of the one who contributed to the last note of the Chariots of Fire at the ceremony at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on a passenger and an international secret that Atkinson once played in a forgotten TV ad for Barclaycard, leaving behind him a real chaos.
In the latest movie, one or two pleasant moments are presented.
I loved when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a middle - century deck, and the rotor lists were briefly involved with his helmet.
Atkinson's comedy gift is clearly displayed, but humor seems a little mild and excessively unnecessary, especially because “real” films such as 007 or Mission is impossible now without bad conscience offer comic elements.
It seems like humor is intended for children and not as many adult viewers, and that is why the dismissed adventures of Johnny English are not as innovative and targeted as Atkinson's German scotches in the role of Mr. Bean.
The constant theme is now obvious that Great Britain is in serious problems.
The web hacker has infiltrated into the network of British secret agents and revealed the identity of all British agents, which has caused great problems to the competent agent who is a surprisingly small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the point of the breaking point for the Prime Minister, a pompathetic figure that has already experienced a breakdown because of political unacceptability: Emma Thompson has been working hard on the role of the apparent Teresa May, but there is nothing in the scenario that could help her.
The Intelligence Service shall inform her that all active spys are disclosed and therefore must decide on one of the retired spys.
And this means Johnny English, now a teacher in a reputation school who teachs us unofficially how to work under cover: here are scenarios hit because English is carrying out some kind of spying rock academy.
They take the English to Whitehall to an emergency meeting where he meets a long-year-old colleague Bough played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotype sports impression, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create more problems on behalf of the Secret Service of Her Highness and meet the fatal Ophelio Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
During the time, the Prime Minister has a dangerous impact on a carismatic technological billionaire who claims that he can solve the computer problems of Britain: this is the evil Jason Walta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odessade: dressed in a waiter fire in the French restaurant, they create chaos when you prethothe on the roof of Walt's yacht, and when English trys to use glasses for the visible reality to meet the inside of Walt's house, he's able to create a general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathetic and energy reminds of the child's movie.
Very average.
Like other movies, Johnny English, I can't help myself here and think: is the British movie able to give Atkinsonu a role that actually justify his talent?
Laburists deny that the British are planning a four-day working week, receiving payment for five-day working week.
The Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyna, is thinking about a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive payment for five days.
The company's leaders wishes that savings created by businesses due to the revolution of artificial intelligence be transmitted to workers and allow them a further day off.
So employees would enjoy the three-day weekend at the same high salary.
The sources say that the idea is consistent with the customer's economic plan and plans to put the state on the side of workers.
The unions support a four-day working week, as this is the way workers can benefit from the advantages of the changing economy.
The source from the Laburist Party said to The Sunday Times: "The policy review should be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but the four-week worker is the goal that we will strive to achieve by approaching the party to balance the economy for the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the four-week working week in its campaign on the general elections in 2017, supported by the Green Party.
This objective is not currently supported by the Laburist Party as a whole.
The representative of the Laburist Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party does not consider it.”
The Cancler in the shadow John McDonnell used the labour conference last week to present his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to erase the power of the “respective directors” and “gossipers” in communal companies.
The drafts of the cancer in the shadows also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not regain the total share, since the labour party could introduce “exemptions” on the basis of alleged injustices.
He also confirmed the plans for the inclusion of workers in the administrative committees and the introduction of ownership funds, by which 10 per cent of the share in private companies would be transferred to employees that would receive annual dividends to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, in the show “60 minutes” (“60 minutes”) discussed whether their opinion could be changed by the Kavanaugh investigation carried out by the FBI.
The investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, carried out by the FBI, has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether findings of the Office of any Republican Senator could convince the judge to withdraw his support.
In the interview carried on Sunday, the correspondent of the release “60 minutes” of the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI could find anything that would change her opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a South Caroline colleague.
“ I mean, of course, ” Kennedy said.
“Before the interrogation, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh
When I called him when this charge came up, I asked him, ‘ Did you do it? ’
He was determined, unlimited, no doubt.”
And Graham's voice seems to be incorporated into a stone.
“I have created my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason to change it”, he said.
“ I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know the following: Brett denied it firmly, ” added Graham, mentioning Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she named was able to confirm it
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Festival of global citizens (Global Citizen Festival) and did it contribute to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday will be hosted by the New York Festival of Global Citizens, an annual music event, which is participating in a really extraordinary type of stars and which has the same outstanding mission: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The Festival, which will take place for a week, will be attended by ten thousands of people. They will be seated on a large track of the Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awake interest in the true purpose of the event, i.e. the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is the extension of the Global Citizens Project, an international defendant group who hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (except if you were ready to pay for the VIP ticket), the participants of the concert had to perform a number of tasks or acts such as volunteership, a letter to the world leader, a telephone call or any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal to eliminate poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen’s movement that remains 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a way to convince them to require action, or is this just a case of so-calctivism called “clictivism” – creating belief that people actually have an important impact on the situation with the signing of the online petition or by transmitting the Twitter?
The movement of Global Citizen states that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters should be recorded in the effort to achieve a variety of different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to adopt commitments and policies worth more than 37 billion dollars, which would affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early 2018, the group stated that its actions had to be the fruit of 390 commitments and communications, on which it had already been paid or collected at least 10 billion USDs.
The group estimates that the funds collected have had directly affected nearly 649 million people throughout the world so far.
Some of the key commitments are the Energy of Food (The Power of Nutrition), the partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to helping the children realize their full potential, which the Rwandi promised 35 million USD aid to help removal of sustainability after more than 4700 Twitters of the global citizens were received.
“With the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and global citizens such as you, we can redeploy social innocence in historical archives”, told the crowd at the concert in London April 2018 Tracey Ullman, the Ambassador of the Food Power Partnership.
The group also stated that the government, according to more than 5,000 actions made by the United Kingdom, called for improving the nutrition of mothers and children, had informed that it would co-financise the Food Power project, which would achieve 5 million women and children by food measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the web, “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty? ”
The movement of the Global Citizen replied: “This will be a long and hard way – sometimes we fall and we fail.
But as well as the great movement for civil rights and the fight against apartheid ahead of us, we will also succeed because we are stronger together.
Among some of the performers that will attend this year in New York are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae. The event will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy — the US Interior Ministry for the “Blockado” of Russian Energy Exports
The US Internal Minister Ryan Zinke was supposed to say, according to the report of Washington Examiner, that Washington could use the navy to prevent Russian energy markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that the Russian intermediation in Syria (a warning to invite legitimate governments) is an excuse for researching new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire for energy marketing, as it is marketed in Eastern Europe, in the south of Europe,” he should say.
However, the functioner considers that there are ways and means to deal with it.
“United States can start this. The Navy shall ensure that our maritime paths are open and block them if necessary, preventing Russian energy from gaining into the market” he said.
Zinke was referring to the participants of the event hosted by the Union of Energy Consumers, an unprofit group named “glass of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, causing that he was actually the same.
“In terms of Iran and Russia, the economic possibility is more or less affecting fuel and replacement”, he said, nameing Russia as “pony who knows one trick” with an economy depending on fossil fuels.
The statements have been made at the time when Trump's administration seeks to increase the export of its exhausted natural gas to Europe, where it is intended to undermine Russia, which is a significantly cheaper choice for European consumers.
For this purpose, the officials of the Trump Government, including the US President, Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to renounce the “inappropriate” gaswater project North Stream 2, which is supposed to be a “lawler” of Moscow after Trump Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the northern flow 2 gas flow is worth 11 billion USD, which is to double the existing gaswater capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, exclusively a economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington has violently opposed the project only for economic reasons and that it is a unfair competition.
"I think we have the same view that energy must not be a tool to carry out pressure and that consumers must have the right to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after a September meeting with the US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the American position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leadership of the German industrial organisation, the Union of German Industry (BDI), invited the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Integrating the third country into our energy supply is a big problem for me”, the recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Union (BDI).
Elizabeth Warren will "examine" her candidature at the elections for the US President in 2020, says Massachusett Senator
Massachusett Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “examine ” her candidacy for the US President after the interim elections.
In the city house in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidature.
"The time is for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman's leader," the officer of The Hill reported.
"I will examine my president's candidacy after November 6th."
Warren was conquered by President Donald Trump at a meeting in the city's house because he was supposed to lead the country in the wrong direction.
“What Donald Trump does to our democracy, I am terribly concerned,” she said.
Warren and the candidate for the President of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh have been openly criticised.
In the Twitter published on Friday, Warren said: “Of course before the elections we need a FBI investigation. ”
The survey published on Thursday showed that most of its own voters believed that Warren should not be pursued to the position of the President in 2020.
According to the Political Research Centre in the Suffolk/Magazine Boston Globe, the senator should not be running for the president, eighty-fifty percent of the "probably" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty percent of her candidacy would support them.
The survey showed that the former governor Deval Patrick had greater support for the candidature, with 38 percent of the surveys, and 48 percent were to oppose it.
Other high democrats who would come to respect the candidature in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
The bid after the report of the Associated Press has stated that he will make official decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentioned the posttraumatic stress disorder in support of Donald Trump at the meeting
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after his military entry.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of family violence
“As my own son survives after his return, he connects me to other families who face posttraumatic stress disorder and the measure of injury with which our soldiers are returning," he told the public at the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
She marked the son's arrest as “the elephant in the salon ” and said that her son and other war veterans returned to a few modified, embarrassed, wondering where respect for what the soldiers and aircraft and all other members of the army were offering to the country.”
Track Palina was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and was accused of violence in the family with a attack on a woman, obstacles in family violence and arms possession, Dan Bennett, a representative of the police station in Vasilla, said.
18 federal states and Colombia District support the refusal of new asylum policy
The 18 federal states and the Colombian District support the legal condemnation of a new American policy, which denies the right to asylum to victims who flee against violence against gangs or family violence.
The NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the district concerned filled the courtroom on Friday in order to support the legal obligation of the policy.
The full name of the prosecutor in the lawsuit of Grace against the sessions, which was not published by the American Union for Civil Freedoms against Federal Policy.
She said that her partner and “her violent sons, members of the gang ” abused her, but the American authorities rejected her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors of the federal states supporting Grace have described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which many asylum requests come to the United States, as countries who constantly deal with the problems of gangs and family violence.
The new asylum policy of the United States repealed in 2014 the decision of the Committee on Calls of Immigrants, which is an unnoticed immigrant fleeing from domestic violence, to invoke an asylum application.
The State Prosecutor of the District of Columbia, General Karl Racine, stated on Friday that the new policy “has descended decades of state, federal and international law”.
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application, and that type of prohibition is violated”, states the request in the Court of Justice.
The state prosecutors further indicated in the request that the policy that immigrants deny the right to enter is harming the American economy, as they should be more likely to become entrepreneurs and “requisite the necessary labour force”.
The General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions has appointed the immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and violence of the gangs.
“Azil is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership in a single social group or political opinion”, said the Sessions on 11 June in its publication of politics.
Asylum was never considered to address all problems, even serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Paluo has doubled, but there are desperate rescue attempts to find survivors
The survivors were getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma when she comforted her hot boy in the evacuation center in the dissolved town of Palo.
"The savior keeps bringing the bodies.
It has pure waters.’
It seemed to be a city who returned to ruined homes who walked through wet things and tried to find anything useful.
There were hundreds of people and hospitals damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 were overloaded.
Some injured, including 2 Harris, who suffered the injury of the back and shoulder, were rested outside the military hospital in Paluo, where patients were treated on free because of the persistent powerful earthly sunsets.
When he remembered the rapid earthquake that shattered the hotel room in the fifth floor where he was accommodated with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed against the ruins of the walls," Harris told the Associated Press Agency. He added that he was with his family in town because of the wedding.
“I heard a woman calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe.'
The American Ambassador accuses Chinese “control” with “propagand advertising”
A week after the publication of a four-sided announcement of the official Chinese newspaper in the American Journal, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China of Peking accused the abuse of the American Propaganda Press.
The US President Donald Trump mentioned the payable supplement of China Daily in Officer Des Moines Register, the most selling newspaper in the Federal State of Iowa, after he accused China of interference in American Congress elections on November 6th, which China denies.
The Reuters Agency reported that American federal officials Trump's accusation that Peking tried to interfere with the US federal elections were described as a new phase in the increasingly intense efforts of Washington to press China.
Although the publication of advertising for trade is common for foreign governments, Peking and Washington are currently complicated in the increasingly intensive trade war, in which they exchange the blows by introducing customs on import products.
The Chinese reimbursement tariffs in the beginning of the trade war are intended to affect exporters in federal countries such as Iowa, supporting the Trump Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador in China and the former long-year governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Peking suffered from American workers, farmers and companies.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of Officer Des Moines Register, “now this opposition doubles by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press”.
“In the expansion of the propaganda, the Chinese government has used the valued American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid ad in Officer Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions on the papers in Beijing and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions that the Chinese citizens have on anxious Chinese economic path because the communities are strictly supervised by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected the offer for publication” of his article, although he did not indicate which.
The Republicans are losing elections before interim elections with a breakthrough with Kavanaugh, the analysts warn
Analysts warn that the support of many important Republicans who support and defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, despite a number of sexual attacks, will be known in the arriving interim elections by losing elections.
Emotions are extremely high here, but most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, a professor of politology at Maxwell University in Syracuse for the article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubts that the pressure of Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the FBI in the last minute will be enough to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow and not November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a higher advisor and a national representative of the advanced Group of MoveOn, on Friday, according to Officer Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters sang “November is coming!” when they demonstrated in the senate corridor, when the Republicans who supervise the judicial committee decided to further support Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the New York Portal Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democrats will overcome all borders," the portal told the journalists Stu Rothenberg, an non-party political analyst.
"People say they're strong now, and they hold it.
However, it could be even stronger, especially among the undefined voters in pre-spots and younger voters aged 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, but do not choose often.”
Even before the public testimony of Ford, in which she detailed her charges on the sexual attack of the candidate for the Supreme Court, the analysts said that further republic support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a big mess for the GOP”, said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Council, reporting NBC News at the beginning of the last week.
"It is not only the vote of the world or the final vote or the Kavanaugh's voting; it is also the way the Republicans deal with it and how they treated Ford," Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities Group, who supports democrats in elections.
The Americans seem to be a little divided between the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a little more support for them.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of the surveyers are surely trusted or most trusted in the testimony of Ford, and 35 percent said that they were surely or most trusted in Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent claimed that Kavanaugh was likely or surely lying during the testimony, and that said only 30 percent of them about Ford.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBA is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, and at least one of the prosecutors, Deborah Ramirez, reported Officer The Guardian.
Ford last week before the Senate's judicial council, she sweared that, when Kavanaugh was 17 years old, she was attacked in a state of guilt.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her sex when they were together at the party during their study at Yale University in 1980.
The inventor of the world's website intends to start a new Internet to cope with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world's website, opens a starting company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Googlu.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners' open-water platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee was kidding that the purpose of the Intrupte was to “conquer the world”.
"We have decided to do this now," he said about the new company.
"He's playing for a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid Platform Technology, which allows users to create a “personal data storage storage storage” or sub-a
This may contain contact information, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Similarly, Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal storage storage warehouse is that the user can fully determine who can access any information.
The company calls this “personal data authorization”.
The Executive Director John Bruce says that the idea of the company is to combine sources, processes and appropriate skills that will enable each one to access Solid platform.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few rented developers to work on the project and the community of volunteers programmers.
With this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications by using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group “with Facebook and Google are not talking about whether they could introduce a complete change that could remove all their business models overnight.”

Bernard Vann: Holiday of Victoria's cross from World War 1
In the hometown for 100 years, Victoria’s cross was celebrated to the only priest of the English church that he had gained as a warrior in the first world war.
The honorable Colonel Bernard Vann deserved a recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was shot by a shooter, so he never learned that this highest British military honor was given to him.
On Saturday, two Colonel grandsons discovered a memorial stone on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the lawyers, Michael Vann, said that it was “excellently symbolic ” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s deed.
According to the report of Officer London Gazette, under Colonel Vann on September 29, 1918, he led his battalion through the Canal of St. Quintin “with a very dense fog and under the strong fire of the battlefields and machines.”
Later, he planned against the shooting line and led the line forward with “the largest heroism ” and then attacked the machinery and hit three members of the crew.
Lieutenant Vanna – only a good month before the end of the war – was shot by a German shooter.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his old father were “the things I know and I could never achieve, so teach me humility. ”
With a brother, Dr. James Van, they also put a vein on the parade led by the beauty of Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “happy to participate in this parade, ” and that“ the courage of the real hero is reflected in the support expressed by many people. ”
The enthusiasts of mixed fighting skills have been screaming all night to watch Bellator 206.
Imagine: You've been screaming all night to watch the totally selled Bellator 206, then you can't see the main event.
The event in San José covered 13 fights, including six on the main parket, and was carried live in the United Kingdom on the 5th channel.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegar Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, the audience in the United Kingdom scatteredly discovered that the transfer was replaced by playing a painting of Puys Pep.
Many were not very impressed because he remained awake until the morning because of the struggle.
One of the enthusiasts described on Twitter a switch to a child’s painting as “some kind of painting. ”
“In accordance with the government Regulation, this content is not suitable at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the child program”, said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of the Bellator Organisation for Market and Communication when they asked him about the transfer.
"Puisa Pepa.
The President of the Bellator, Scott Coker, said that they were trying to adjust the schedule by allowing the viewers in the United Kingdom to be involved in the future.
"When I think about re-speaking, I think we could arrange this," Coker said.
“But then there is sixth hour in Sunday and we will not be able to fix this until Sunday after our time or Monday by theirs.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, a number of messages have been exchanged at the shutdown and not all were kind.
We tried to fix this problem; we assumed it was only a technical error.
However, the government was the reason.
I can promise you that this will not happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will bear five fights — as usual, and we have tried to offer more than expectations to the fans, and we have noted it.
This is a very ungrateful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “minor” about sexuality.
The Olympic diver Tom Daley said that his sexual focus made him feel less worthy than anyone — but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that “not everyone like himself” was aware of the entry into high school.
During the first talk in the Desert Island Discs Radio 4 radio station Lauren Laverne said that he talked about the rights of gays to give the hope to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympic Games decreased.
The regular leader of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, was absent because of a multiple-month disease.
Daley, who appeared as an exclusive in the first show of Laverne, said that he felt ‘ less worthy ’ than everyone else, since ‘ it was not socially acceptable to have loved boys and girls. ’
He said: “To this day, these feelings of minority and distinction are a real thing that gives me strength and persistence to achieve success. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said that he would not disappoint anyone who would finally learn about his direction.
Two times the bronch Olympic competitors became an influenced LGBT-right defender and appeared twice this year at the Games of the Nations in Australia to invite countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy to speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give “hope to others. ”
The three-fold world champion said that a romance with a man — an American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 — was “amazed”.
Daley and the winner, who is older than 20 years old, reported last year, but says that the difference in years never meant a problem.
“When you are so young,” he attended the first Olympic games, and three years later his father died, he said, it is difficult to find someone of the same age that would experience similar rises and falls.
On June, a couple adopted the child, the son of Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that it changed his "the whole view".
“If I had been asked last year, everything that I should say would be that “I must reach a gold medal”, he said.
"But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years due to brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he had to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether he had tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
I couldn’t say to him: “This time you will not be in the first row, Dad, ” he said.
“I held him for a hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally had to admit that he was not immaculate," he said.
Next year, Daley competed in the Olympic Games in 2012 and reached a bronze medal.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed all my life – to flood up in the Olympic games before the local public. There was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired his first choice of song – Heather Small’s musical proud, followed by the preparations for the Olympic Games, and still boiling his skin.
Desert Island Discs is played at the BBC Radio station 4 every week at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson, the Saturday Ryder's Cucle is overdone.
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Sunday, when he plays his 47th game in Ryder's rock, but he'll have to get back to the shape so that it won't become an unfortunate border.
Mickelson, who's been involved in the biennial event 12 times, captain Furyk left a seat on Saturday four.
Instead of being in the center of the event, as often as for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a fan and parts in improving his game to fix what it is tough.
Since even at the top of the career has not been the most straight, the 48-year-old does not fit the best narrow game of Le Golf National, where the long ice is inevitablely punishing missed strokes.
And if only the playground wouldn't be scary enough, Mickelson will have to deal with the exact British Open Francescom Molinari, who was in a victory in all four games this week with the newsman Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans who have four less games at the beginning of the 12 games of individuals were to begin well, the Mickelson's game could turn out to be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he didn't say much.
"He fully understands the role he played today," Furyk said.
"There is a lot of confidence in the village.
He's one of the famous ones, and in the past, and also this week, he made great contributions to the teams.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I've imagined more, but that's how it came out, and we thought it was necessary to do so.
He wants to play, just like everyone else."
Mickelson's gonna smash Nick Fald's record on Sunday for the largest number of runs played in Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of Ryder's career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equations, but Furyk said that his presence in the team also brings some inconvenient benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes making a fool of people and it's great to have it in the team space," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun with him this week, which was fun to see."
It gives much more than just a game.”
The European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great privilege can soon be scattered.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, from experience knows that an important advantage at the beginning of the last day of the games of individuals in Ryder's slaughter can easily be converted into an unpleasant ride.
The young Danec debited in 1997 at a Valderrama competition, where the captain, whose captain was Seve Ballesteros, had five points of advantage before the Americans, with its goal, with only the advantage of the hair, with the result of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“Do not forget that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but barely," said Bjorn (on the picture) after the review of the class of 2018 , who won with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and led to Le Golf National playground with 10-6.
So history shows me and everyone in the team that the popcorn is not over yet.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you need.
It's not over until it's on the board.
We have a goal to win this crop, and we have to keep focusing on it.
He says all the time that I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we're also well aware of who stands on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn added, enthusiastic about the game of his players at a difficult playground: “I would never have rushed over there.
It's gonna be a different day tomorrow.
Tomorrow in front of the game of individuals, it will have to be done differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you're alone there, your skills of golfist are tested to the end.
This is a message you must transfer to the players: Tomorrow you have to extract the best.
Now leave your partner behind you and he also has to take out the best of himself."
In contrast with Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as a partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who reached three points of four.
Furyk was already on both sides of the conversions in the last day, since he was part of the victory team in Brooklyn before he ended as a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every surprised word," he replied when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, told his players on the last day of the game.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important moves, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When this start gets persistence, it is strongly pressured on middle games.
We created a proper setup and set the boys in a way, until we felt that we would do something magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to try to fight and fight Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the sort of order.
“In this group of boys, I have decided on this kind of order because I think it covers the entire schedule”, said Bjorn about the choice of individuals.
The new German warship rehabed
The latest fregate of the German Navy should be transferred to the use of 2014 to replace the older warships from the cold war, but due to system disorders and rapidly growing costs, local communities reported.
The ship surrender “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leading ships of the new class fregat Baden-Wuerttemberg, is now translated to the first half of 2019, says Officer Die Zeit, quoting a military representative.
The vessel should join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project pestises anxious issues after delivery.
Four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered in 2007, will be replaced by the ageing class fregat of Bremen.
It is expected that they will have a strong gun, a species of anti-Aviation and anti-lady shootings and some covering technologies, such as a reduction in the radar, infrared and acustical signature.
Other important characteristics include longer intervals between maintenance — the latest fregates are supposed to stay outside the domestic port for up to two years.
The continuous delays, however, mean that the top warships, which would enable Germany to influence oversea by its power, have become older until the start of use, observed Officer Die Ziet.
The unfortunate F125 fregate appeared on the covers last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
That was the first time that the navy returned the ship to the ship after the supply.
The reasons for return were only small, and German communications indicated a number of key “programme and technical deficiencies” that would make the warship unused if it was sent to the battle mission.
The deficiencies of the software equipment were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will manage the crew with approximately 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the older fregates of the Bremen class.
It also proved that the ship is strongly overwhelmed, which reduces its capacity and limits the possibilities of the Navy for its future upgrade.
The 7000-tonne ship “Rheinland-Pfalz” should be twice as heavy as ships of similar class that the Germans used in the second World War.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the price of the entire project has also become a problem, including training of the crew.
This is intended to reach EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) from the starting EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is reduced.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the navy is actually "without ships suitable for guidance."
The official said that the issue had eventually been aggravated because the old ships were degraded and the replacement vessels were not guaranteed.
He regretted that no ship from Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund listens to the secret life of the netopiers
A new research in Scotland’s estate is being conducted in which they are trying to discover how nettopiers use food for food hunting.
They hope that the results will reinstate the behaviour of these unique flying sugars and help direct future storage activities.
In the study, scientists of the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small netopias and tiny netopers and brown netopiers and circuit nettories in the property of Inverewe Gardens in the West Ross area.
In key places of property, they will be placed with special recorders to monitor the activities of netopiers throughout the entire season.
The NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all videos will confirm the frequency of calls of netopiers and what kinds of things they do.
Then they will prepare a habitat map and a report to create a detailed picture of their behavior throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, NTS advisor for Nature Conservation, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitats are the most suitable for netopers and how each individual species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefit of the management of habitats, such as the creation of grass and the maintenance of forests for netopers and other related species.
The number of netopiers in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects refugees and the loss of accommodation.
Risks also represent wind turbines and lights, as well as flyers and certain types of chemical processing of construction materials, as well as house cat attacks.
The netopers are not really blind.
Because of the habits of hunting, they are more helpful with their ears than with their eyes.
They use a thorough echolocation technique to determine the errors and obstacles on the flight.
NTS, responsible for providing more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76.000 hectares of the country, takes the netopias very seriously.
He hires ten experts regularly carrying out research, refugees and occasional rescue.
In the property of Threave in Dumfries and Gallowey, the organization has even established the first and for now the only Scottish reserve, especially for the netopiers.
The director of the property David Thompson says the property is an ideal land for them.
"We have a great area in Threavo," he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all quality habitats.
However, there is still a lot to be known about netopiers, so the work we do here and on other propertys will help us better understand what they need to achieve.”
He emphasized the importance of verifying the presence of netopiers before carrying out the maintenance parts on the property, as possible unwanted destruction of one netopir's own breeding can cause death to 400 females and young men, which may mean a decline in the entire local population.
The netopers are protected, so they are forbidden to be murdered, oppressed or disturbed and also prohibited to destroy their families.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish leader of the Storage Fund, has encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: “We still need to learn a lot about our netoporians and we simply don’t know how well their populations are. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and lawyers are preparing for the German magazine's lawsuit.
Cristiano Ronaldo indicated that the rape that he was supposed to commit was “fake news” and said that people wanted to “promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing for a German magazine with the news of Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused that in 2009 he raped the American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in the hotel room in Las Vegas.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $37,000 for the silence of the event.
In the invitation of 142 million followers in Instagram Live video hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, marked the reports as “fake news”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said is false news,” said five times the Golden Ball winner in the camera.
“With my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I'm a happy man and I wish everyone good," a smiling player added.
Ronald's attorneys are preparing to sue Der Spiegel's magazine for charges referred to as “inappropriate reporting of suspicions on private life”.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player would require compensation for “independent damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the past years.”
The alleged incident was expected to happen in June 2009 in the hotel Palms Hotel and Casino apartment in Las Vegas.
In the documentation filed at the District Court of Clark in Nevada, after meeting at Mayorg’s night club with Ronald, it was analytical rape.
Mayorga claims that after this event, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her that he was “99% good man” who was only disappointed in“one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the sexual relationship, but described it as an agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she was headed to the police and that the hospital had taken photos of her injuries and later agreed on an external settlement because she was “free fear of revenge ” and was concerned with“ public humiliation. ”
The 34-year-old claims that he wants to dismiss the settlement, since he still has a severe trauma due to the alleged event.
Ronaldo was at the time of the suspect attack just before the Real Madrid transition to Manchester United, and this summer, according to an agreement worth 100 million dollars, moved to the Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: the United Kingdom would “regret forever” loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would ‘regret forever’ if it lost the status of the leading world car manufacturer, Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “restraining” that the Toyota UK for BBC said that the exit of Britain from the EU without an agreement would temporarily stop production in the Burnastone factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the delay on the border in the case of brexite without agreement could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory, produced by Auris and Avensis model Toyotina, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think that if Britain exits from the European Union by the end of March without an agreement, production in our factory would be stopped”, said Marvin Cooke, Toyote's administrative director at Burnaston factory.
The concern of how the exit from the European Union without agreement will affect cross-border trade, also expressed by other manufacturers of cars in the United Kingdom, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, the BMW said that after Brexit, it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month.
The main considerations relate to what car manufacturers call risks related to the supply chain in the case of brexite.
Toyotina's production line operates under the principle “in the right time”, with parts of the suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for cars on order coming every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom came out of the EU on 29 March without an agreement, this could cause disturbance on the borders that the representatives of the panoge say they could cause delay and lack of parts.
Toyota, in its factory in Derbyshire, could not be stored for more than one day of parts, said the representatives of the company, so the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that the Teresa May plan for future relations with the EU was “to be precisely moderate to avoid such border verifications”.
“We need to reach a deal. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success but to grab this opportunity” he said for the presentation of Todayy BBC Radio 4.
“It is not only Toyote, but also other producers that we must be absolutely capable of pursuing a highly successful set of supply chains.”
The company of Toyota could not comment on how long the production would be stopped, and it warned long-termly that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and finally lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Union union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, the lost job is never returned. ”
The government representative said: "We must present a accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be reinstated, says the White House.
The important meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be “present for another week,” said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is supervising the work of a special advisor Robert Muller studying the Russian pre-electoral intervention, links between Trump's collaborators and Russia and the potential president's obstacle to the judicial authorities.
The question of whether Trump will forgive the prosecutor-General and endanger Mueller's independence has been intensifying Washington talks for months.
In the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of the trampeting device for the recording of talks with Trump and the possibility of removal of the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denyed the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House, in the middle of the reporting that he intends to depart.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was declared on Thursday at the United Nations conference in New York.
Trump said that Rosenstein “will not be fired”, and the meeting was then revoked to avoid a conflict with the hearing of the senate committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual behaviour, Dr. Ford.
On Friday, Trump appointed a united investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which also postponed the vote of the Senate.
Trump's press agent, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday at Fox News.
When she was asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not yet set for it; it could have happened this week, according to all the other things in the Supreme Court, but it could be delayed for another week.
We will see. I always like to make sure that you are informed."
Some rapporteurs would object to this, and Sanders has not called for a meeting of the White House with the press since September 10th.
The chief of the show Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the rare meetings weren't going to resist TV rapporteurs, but she said: “I couldn't deny them to be placed.”
Then she mentioned that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President performs more press conferences than any president before him," she said, "We have looked at numbers without any indication of source."
The meetings will continue to take place," Sanders said. "But if journalists can directly address the President of the United States with their question, this is indefinitely better than being discussed with me.
We are trying to make this possible and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference on which you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guests.
The independent press conferences are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why, when he appeared freely and partly bizarrely in front of the gathered journalists.
Letter from the Ministry of Health of the EU Workers in NHS Scotland concerning the fear related to brexite
The EU Health Minister, working at the Scotic NHS, wrote that it would express its appreciation for the State and the desire to continue work after the Brexite.
Jean Freeman, SME, sent a letter less than six months before the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scotland government has already committed to paying the costs of applications to arrange the status of EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “In the summer the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued on the exit, when the decision was made to be taken this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government has also accelerated the preparation for a possible exit scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each personnel, regardless of its nationality.
Colleagues from all the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health sector's work and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
You can feel perfectly home in Scotland. We really want to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie urgently operated after head damage
The line supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, after his head was damaged on Saturday defeat with 31:27 against Vanderbilt Commodores's mob, reported by Mike Organ from The Tennessean.
The Chief Coach of the Tennessee State University told the journalists that the injury had occurred just a few months ago.
“He came to the edge of the playground and kind of ruined there,” said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel provided Abercrombie on the edge of the playground with oxygen before they put it on the weapons and took it from the field for further review.
The official from the Tenneese State University told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering after surgery in Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that “details on type/scope of injury are not yet known” and that the Tenneese State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, which is currently bruc at the university, plays for the Tennese State University for the first time after the transition from the university to Illinois.
On Saturday, he experienced five hits together before he left the game, which raised his total number of hits in the season to 18 hits.
Foreign customers will be charged with higher fees when they buy real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign customers will be charged with a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used according to the new Torian plans for helping homeless
The move will neutralize the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Increased quantities will be charged by those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The treasury expects to gather up to 120 million pounds a year, and will appoint them to help homeless.
Foreign customers will be charged with a higher level of quantities when they buy real estate in the United Kingdom, while the money collected will be aimed at homeless, today will be sent to Theresa May.
The move should be considered as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide price-accessible apartments and higher taxation for high-income persons.
The increased quantity will be charged to persons and companies not paying tax in the United Kingdom and will encourage the Government's efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The fee – which will be charged with the current quantity, including the increased levels set out two years ago for other homes and property for transfer, could be not less than three per cent.
The Trust expects that, by introducing an action, it will collect up to 120 million GBP per year.
According to the estimates, the non-State of the United Kingdom should buy 13 percent of the newly built London real estate, resulting from the increase of prices and the hardest purchase of the first real estate.
Many rich areas of the country — especially in the main city — have become “the cities of ghosts” because the number of customers who spend most of their time outside the country is increasing.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called to reduce the quantity so that young people could easily buy their first home.
The large construction companies accused the prices of raising the land that they do not really use, and Mrs. Mayevo called to leave the quotas for price-available apartments to repair the British "habitable shame".
Mr. Corbyn foretold an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rental surveillance and ending forced expulsions without mistakes.
Furthermore, he wants to give the city’s world greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. Mayeva said: “In the last year, I said that I would devote my premiere leadership to the renewal of British dreams — that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means repair of our non-activating housing market.
Great Britain will always be open for people who want to live here, work and create their life.
However, it cannot be right for those who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies to buy homes is as simple as for the garas citizens of the British.
For too many people, dreams of their own home are all too far away, and humiliation of homelessness remains all too real.”
Jack Ross: “My final goal is to manage the Scotland Club”
The chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his “final goal” is once become the manager of the Scotland Club.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of restoring the North-East club, currently seized by the third place in the First League, with three points less than the first-classed.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after St. Mirren reinstateed to the Scotland Championship in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross said about the BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up with a frequent observation of Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that dragged me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if I had been successful in the management of the club."
Ross' preliminary headed by Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the team, Alloa Athletic, who had rejected before offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, said that he did not feel fear as heir of such great names.
“The success is measured to me with the question ‘Can I bring this club again to First League?’”.
According to the structure and capacity, this club is undoubtedly part of the First League," he said.
"The road to there is not easy, but it would probably be successful only if the club could take it there again."
Ross has been doing the work of the manager only three years after the Assistant Chief in Dumbarton was part of the Hearts training staff for 15 months.
Alloi then helped to prevent the fall into the third League, and St. Mirren led from the edge of the fall to the championship address in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“This was probably a real breakthrough”, he recalled the Alloe's receipt.
“I was truly convinced that managership was a real thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds ridiculous because I was doing good to the player, making myself well with it, and I have also achieved some more success.
But the game can become difficult.
We need to face a number of things every week.
In this regard, in terms of stress and pressure at work, I still fight, but managing simply feels like a real thing for myself.
I've always wanted to run the club, and I'm doing it now. In my skin, I feel more comfortable in my whole adult life now.”

Research results: ideal beer time is on Saturday 17:30
The summer heat has increased the income of difficultly overwhelming British pubs, but the pressure on the restaurant chains has also increased.
In July, pubs and bar groups increased sales by 2.7 per cent, but the returns of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business advisor, who prepared the data, said: “The persistent sun time and participation of England in the world’s cattle that lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar sample as June last month, when the arrival of pubs increased by 2.8 percent but that the restaurants were even stronger.
Traffic drop in restaurants by 1.8 per cent in June has also increased in July.
Traffic in pubs and drink bars increased more in mutual comparison than the traffic in restaurants decreased.
Solar weather also reduced sales in pubs offering mainly food, but not as dramatic as in restaurant managers.
Looks like people just wanted to go for a drink.
In different pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6.6% in one month, and food sales decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman, analyst group for free time and hospitality of RSM, said: “These results continue to follow the trend that we have observed since the end of April.
In the sales market, the largest factor of the time and impact of large social or sports events remains.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to fight, although the fall of 4.8% at the intermediate level will be particularly painful due to continuous cost pressures.
For the owners of the sites with a long hot summer could not come at a more bad time and only the time will tell whether the recovery will be needed to bring the moderate temperatures we experienced in August.’
The total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2,7% in July, which indicates the slow inclusion of trade marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker, sales criteria in the pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data on the performance of 47 business groups with a total traffic of more than 9 billion pounds and introduced an industrial reference.
One of the five children on the social network has a secret account that hides from their parents
The research showed that one of the five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — are a secret account on the social network that hides from parents and teachers
A survey among 20,000 students showed the growth of false Instagram pages
The news strengthened fears of the publication of sexually connected contents
Twenty percent of the students said that they had the “major” account intended for their parents
One of the five children - some of whom are only 11 years old - creates an account that is hiding from their parents on social networks.
A survey among 20,000 students showed a rapid increase in false Instagram accounts.
The news strengthened the fears of the publication of sexually related contents.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to manage the censored “main ” account showing to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
The mother, who ran into a secret page of a 13 - year - old daughter, noticed that the visitor's daughter called her to rape.
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK Network and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40% of 11-18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them recognized that they had a private account.
President HMC Mike Buchanan said: “It is anxious that so many teenagers are subject to temptation and create a web space where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “glass of athletes” to the Scotland Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scotland Athletic Committee as a non-executive director of the annual General Assembly of the Administrative Committee.
Doyle was the most delighted Scottish athlete in the field and free and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those directing sports to use its extensive experience at the international level in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletic Community. We are convinced that the athletic in Scotland, with its involvement in the committee, would have gained enormous acquisition,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope that I can really contribute and help to the Sports management in Scotland. ”
The American , who won from a total of four Olympic medals at 200 meters and 400 meters on the Olympic Games in 1996 in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, remained without a speech capability after a transitional ischemical attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago, a drop hit me.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was only time to tell me if I could recover, and how much.
It was hard work, but I was completely recovered, learned to walk again, and today I exercise agility training!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!"
An ad for the breast pump comparing mothers with cows has shared online opinions
The company that produces breast pumps shared opinions with an ad comparing mothers with cows in the mud.
In order to start the marketing of the “first silent breast pump”, Elvia has published a provocative musical ad that should show the mothers all freedom that the aid allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a tree filled with shadow, on a song that includes the following word: “Yes, I push myself, but there is no tail,” and “If you haven't noticed, these are not my seats, these are my boobs.”
The collection continues: “Free, exhaustive, I feed babies, exhaustive, exhaustive, grieving breasts. ”
However, the announcement published on the Facebook website has caused a major disturbance on the Internet.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, he received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many said he was joking on the account of the milk industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they are pregnant and scotted to produce milk, but their children are stealed in the first days after the cottage," one wrote.
Elvie's breast pump is discreetly fitted into breast bruise (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Of course, it is traumatic for both, both mother and a young man.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump for mothers that keep their children?”
Someone else added: “The ad is absolutely unsensitive. ”
Others praised the ad, and one of the women confessed that she seemed like a song “looking ridiculous. ”
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy her too if I still had breastfeeded.
I felt exactly like a cow when I pulled up.
It's a little crazy, but I understood it, just as it was thought.
This is a brilliant product,” wrote the second.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad that aims at mothers who are exhausting milk (often at work or toilet) and feel like cows. ”
This is not an ad that would commend or condemn the milk industry.’
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they were dancing with hidden pumps in the bruise.
The concept of action is that many women who push breasts say they feel like cows.
Elvie Pump pump is completely silent, has no strings or tubes and is discreetly fitted in breast bruise, which allows women to move, hold the child, and even activities free during the drawing of milk.
Anne Balarin, a partner and ECD in the mothers, further commented. “The pump of Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he earned a bold and provocative presentation.”
With the stream of a comparison between women who draw milk and cows of milk, we wanted to put in the lightlight the drawing of milk and all its challenges, and in a fun way that women can connect, to show an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first case when Elvie's pump came to the covers.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children on the model path walked to form Martha Jacobowski when she used the product.
Thousands of children of migrants moved quietly to the tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen strongly, even if the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the grave rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made children more difficult to hand over to sponsors.
Most undocumented migrant sponsors are traditionally, so they are afraid that the child's request would endanger their own opportunities to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities reported that potential sponsors and other family members of the household will have to give fingerprints and that data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official at the Immigration and Customs Agency, witnessed before the convention that the agency arrested more than ten people who requested sponsorship of adolescents without accompanyment.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no previous criminal evidence.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or household members are illegal in the country, and many of them are punished aliens.
Therefore, we continue to look for these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to address children faster, the officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in the court within a month of their detention and not after 60 days of the previous standard, the workers in the shelter said.
Many will appear with a video conference call, not personally to defend themselves from the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for assistance will be expelled quickly.
The longer the children in detention are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent explosions or escape attempts after the statements of workers in prisons and reports in the system in recent months.
Protectors said that these concerns were greater in larger institutions, e.g. Tornill, where the signs of the child’s tribulation due to their size were more likely to remain unseen.
They added that the movement of children into the city of tents without being emotionally prepared or given them an opportunity for a word from their friends, could confuse a trauma that many of them face.
Syria invites American, French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
In the invitation of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moul of Syrian refugees invited them to return home, even though the country has been war for eight years.
The Moul, who also performs the tasks of the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on the Syrian ground are illegal, under the claim of fighting terrorism, and that “will also act in harmony with them. ”
“Instantly and without condition, they must withdraw” he said to the congregation.
Moulem said that “the war against terrorism ” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011, and millions had to leave their homes,“ nearly finished. ”
He said that Damascus will continue to “fight this holy battle until we clean up the Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and“ any illegal foreign presence. ”
In Syria, the United Nations has approximately 2,000 soldiers who train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Basar Al Asad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war of the displaced state.
On the fugitives, he told Moul that the conditions for them were suitable for return, and obliged “some Western states” for the“ spread of unreasonable fears” that persuaded refugees to stay abroad.
“We invited the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their easier returns,” he said.
"The political issue is changed, which should be exclusively a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria not to receive renewable resources until Asad and the opposition reach the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon zone in the last important resistance of the rebels, Idlibu, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement prevented the massive attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province in which three million people live.
However, he emphasized Moulem's agreement on a "jassy hand" and expressed the hope that the military intervention will be focused on the dżihadist, including the Fronte Nusra fighters associated with Al-Kaido, which is "both eliminated".
The Member of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon convene the first meeting of the new committee consisting of the members of the Government and the opposition to prepare a constitution for Syria and press the way to elections.
It defined the conditions of the Syrian Government for the participation in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to “review of the members of the current constitution” and warned before intervention.
Why Trump will reach the second mandate
After this conclusion, Mr Trump will win on the re-electoral elections in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers hope, his presidency will soon end with interpelation and scandal.
Which would be no doubt “the most dramatic finals of the presidentship ever! ”
There are no signs of audience's tiredness for now.
Since 2014, the CNN was more than doubled by 1.05 million in the maximum view, while the MSNBC view was almost triped to 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has a average of 2.4 million audiences at the highest time, which is more than four years ago in Nelsen, when he had 1.7 million, the “The Rachel Maddow Show” on the MSNBC channel reached the largest number of cable clients with 3.5 million viewers at night’s important news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it is something we don't understand,” said Neal Baer, director of the drama “Designed Survivor” (Designed survivors), on a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a recognised writer of comedies and authors of the book “Only funny parts: and a few hard truths about wandering in the Hollywood Boys Club,” offers a different explanation.
Recall the taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, in contrast with what it appears on TV, the Washington story could decide on the future of Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can reconnect and health of the global economy.

For example, Sam, I'll never look like Super Maria again.

When I talked to Mr. Fleiss this week, he was outside his home on the northern coast of Kauaia of sun 80 degrees (26.7 °C), but he was stumbled inside the MSNBC watching when he recorded CNN.
He was unable to quit even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanged in the air.
"I remember that we created all these crazy series at that time and people said, ‘This is the end of Western civilization’," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I changed that it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Foreign money is drawn up to prepare for the most closest intermediate votes
It is not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania district, the fund flood was observed because two candidates were in the race for the same seat.
This has recently been the home of a democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat at the special elections this year in the second district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents an old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is strongly covered by the new 17th district.
The tickets have been drawn newly when the Pennsylvania Supreme Judge of January condemned that the old districts have been anti-constitutionally decorated for the Republicans.
The new 17th district competition touched the fight for the funding of the campaign between the main party's financial bodies, the Congress Committee for Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the broadly monitored march special elections for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been held by the Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political commentators give democrats a slight privilege.
In the United States, sanctions against Salvador were considered for the support of China, and then they retired.
The diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a little opposition from Washington.
Mr Trump had a warm meeting with President Paname Juan Carlos Varelo in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of Trump's organization.
The officials of the Foreign Ministry decided to revoke the US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, “new decisions to cease recognition of Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, representative of the Ministry at the beginning of the month.
However, sanctions were considered on Salvador, which was expected to receive 140 million US aid, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support, according to estimates in 2017.
The proposed sanctions that included the restriction of financial assistance and the targeted visa limitation would have severely affected this Mediterranean state with high unemployment and the number of murders.
During the internal meetings, the North American and Mediterranean officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration in the direction of the United States.
By mid-September, the highest government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, thus concluded their thinking of the penalties for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of conveying participants of the conference, which is now planned for the mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the US government assigns to the meeting, the diplomats added.
The three American ambassadors returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new communications or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to talk about them under anonymity.
Their testimony has been confirmed by an external analyst near the government and has also spoken about it under anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report of a special advisor Robert Muller on the possible obstacle of the judicial authorities, which is now in public records of evidence.
Mr. Mueller should also focus the investigation on whether Mr Trump's campaign has cooperated with Russia in the attack on American elections.
If the Congress changes its hands, Mr Trump will have to answer before the authorities, and even before the jury of his colleagues, right when he is preparing to reconcile his voters.
There are many questions and I don't want to claim that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable, and also not his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could be.
In 1938 the German officials were willing to strike Hitler if the West resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Münchn.
We failed to miss the opportunity to avoid the years of worship that followed.
A change in history and acceleration or inhibition of a non-discriminatory democracy course is made on such interruptions.
The Americans are facing several such breakthroughs right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, a man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in a huge way since this officer reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated about his inappropriateness for this situation.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the report of Officer The Times was incorrect.
"How will we react if the requested investigation of the FBI Brett Kavanaugh will not be exhausted or fair or if he is appointed as a Supreme Judge despite the credible charges of sexual attack and false testimony?
And in particular, will we vote in the interim elections for a convention that will require Mr Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, there's a long winter democracy waiting.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jew, deported by the same Nazi regime in Auschwitz, which once seized my Ambassador’s home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she ordered me to light the sabbath candles on the swastique table.
How could you not be optimistic about our future with such heritage?’

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and it is clear that they will be placed in a convincing position for the qualification of the Group of the European League of Austrian after the impressive remembrance against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month.
The knee injury prevented the connected player Graham Dorrans from appearing in the season for the first time with 2:2 against Villarreal, but believes that the Rangers can use this as a bounce for greater achievements.
“It was a deserved point for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” said a 31-year-old.
“We have entered the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take the point.
Perhaps we could eventually win, but in general, it is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were a better side in the other half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a hard game because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but I am sure with a crowd behind us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
Last year, it was certainly difficult, in view of everything that happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy; training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind us and achieve success."
Easy sleep of women due to fear of savings
Despite having a clear idea of how to care for them, some family members have talked about it.
The half of the surveyers of the Nationwide insurance survey said that they were talking to their spouses about long-term supply costs.
Only 10 percent of them said that they were talking to children about this.
“People want a family member to care for them, but they do not try to talk about it”, said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the life insurance sector at the Nationwide insurance insurance company.
You can start this way.
Talk to your spouse and children : You cannot prepare your family for your care if you don't talk to her about it in time .
Talk to your advisor and your family about where and how you want to receive the supply, as this may be an important factor in the cost assessment.
Include the financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term supply may include a traditional long-term insurance sheet, a combination of cash and life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-sustainment with your own funds, if you can afford that.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles when passing.
Choose a health agent to determine trustworthy person who will supervise your health care and ensure that experts will take into account your health wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider also the authorization of a person for your finances.
Choose your trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are not able to do so on your own.
Do not forget small details: Imagine that your elderly parents need medical assistance urgently and are on their way to hospital.

Federal Prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York demand a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died. It's a rare punishment that has not been executed for federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was supposed to use an rented delivery truck to carry out a bike attack along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan, when he drove more walks and bikes on October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally ” killed eight victims and “intentionally ” caused serious physical injuries, as stated in the notice of the request for death penalty in the Southern County of New York.
According to the judicial document, any of the charges may be caused by a death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury of Saipov introduced a charge in 22 points, which included eight charges for murder in helping expulsion by the federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded “significant planning and acquisition”, said the prosecutors who described the Saip's way as“ shameful, cruel and distorted.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diega Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drak, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diega Mendoza and Alejandra Damian Pagnuccoa,” is written in the announcement of the intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District District District District's last death penalty was sentenced ten years ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, and he was finally converted to prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last sentenced to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in the city of New York in a federal case in 1953, a married couple who was executed for the conspiracy of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years ago.
Both Rosenberg were executed on the electric table on June 1953.
Saipov, the citizens of Uzbekistan, did not show regret in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he said to investigators that he felt good about what he did.
After the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS videos he watched on the phone.
The police also stated that he requested the ISIS flag to be disclosed in his hospital room.
On 22 points of the charge, he said he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “desperately disappointed ” by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to request a death penalty instead of accepting guilt in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only extend the suffering regarding these events”, said Patton.
Sayip's defence team asked the prosecutors before that not to require death penalty.
For Brexite negotiations, NIGEL FARAGEA should be owed, says the Turkish Member
Today, during the protest at the Torian conference, Nigel Farage promised that he would “mobilize the human army. ”
The former Ukipa leader said that politicians must "sense the heat" of Europeans when one of the own Members of Theresa May suggested that they must be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Ambassador Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "be out now" if he was Mr. Farage's Secretary for Brexit.
However, the challenge that Mrs. Mayeva faces in coordinating its deeply divided species has also been stressed by the Torians, who favored the refusal of brexite who joined a separate protest against brexite in the city.
The Prime Minister endeavours to maintain its plan in a track between the attacks of brexite defenders, opponents of brexite and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva will try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite the opposition and force Eurosceptics and labourists to choose between its package and “Cocos”.
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave (Departure means departure) in Solihul that "he wants to get rid of Chequers".
He said that we should appoint Mr. Farage as a partner and give him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
This Member from Wellingborough added: “I will support the brexite, but we must get rid of Chequers. ”
He described his opposition by saying: “In the world wars, we have not fought to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr. Bone rejected the proposals that the public opinion since the voting in 2016 had changed: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely unreal."
Andrea Jenkyns, who said to the rapporteur, also attended the meeting, said: “I just say, ‘The Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it, and it is also unacceptable for our client and our activists, who are active on the streets and bring us to the election.
Please leave Chequers and start listening."
In a message designed by Mrs. Mayeve, she added: “Premiers keep their work when they fulfill their promises. ”
At the meeting, Mr Farage said that politicians should be given “sensitive fever” if they intend to issue a decision adopted at the 2016 referendum.
“There is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to issue the brexite, and today we're gathered to tell them, ‘We're not going to let you do that.’
In the message of the excited crowd, he added: “I want our political class, on the edge of the issue of brexite, to feel the heat. ”
"We mobilize the human army of this country that has guaranteed us a victory in the Brexite, and we will not be peaceful until we become independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the rest of them walked through Birmingham, where they then held a two - meeting in the city center.
Once the group was established this weekend, the Torians' flags were waved against brexite.
The labour noble Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives for security problems in the application of the party after the opening of the conference.
"They are the people who tell us that they can establish IT systems and all technology for Canada's agreement plus, for a boundary of free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a perfect farce.
There is nothing like a good brexite," he added.
Warren's possible streaming for the president's position will "to explore"
The American Senator Elizabeth Warren says that “the cooperation in the presidential city competition will be explicitly examined” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe journal reports that the Massachusett Democratic Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, which is often critical to President Donald Trump, will be called on November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, a co-president of Trump's election campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is in the centre of speculation to meet Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of “Town Hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her whether she intends to be a president.
Warren answered that it was time for “the city of women to Washington to repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman on top.”
Arrest after the death of LSU Simsa in shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that the suspect was arrested for the shooting of the LSU player Wayd Sims.
The police station in Baton Roug news about the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson's message at a press conference at 11 a.m. after east time.
They published a video of Friday shooting and asked for help in identifying a man on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early on Friday near South University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a shot in the head and finally died,” told the media chief of Murphy J. Paul, reporting the network 247sports.
Wayde was involved in protecting his friend, and Simpson shot him.
At the interrogation, Simpson admitted he was at the scene of the event that he had weapons and that he shot Wayd Simms.
The Simpson was arrested without opposition and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, 198-centimetric young man who grew up in Baton Roug, played 32 games with 10 starts, average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps on the game in the last season.
The Russian great prize: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of the world champion, and the team ordered him to leave the victory to Sebastian Vettl
On Saturday, the moment Valtteri Boltas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that “the Mercedes people will have a strong impact on the race. ”
Bottas started well on the stake and almost left Hamilton dry when he defended his position in the first two bands and invited Wattla to attack his muscle colleague.
Wettel first took Hamilton into a box and let him ride on the tail of traffic, which should be decisive.
Mercedes took him into the box later and left for Vettle, but Hamilton noticed after a few driver's driving action that Ferraria's inclinement leaves the inside side open and risks that after two steps to defense in the third corner, he will be behind.
Max Verstappen started with the last type of network and at the end of the first round at his 21st birthday in the seventh place.
After that, the majority of the car competition without switching tires was meant to perform a rapid finish, to expedite Kim Raikkonen and capture the fourth city.
He finally entered the box in the 44th circle, but in the remaining eight circles he couldn't increase speed, so he seized the fourth town of Raikkonen.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri was driving fantasticly all weekend and it was a real gentleman when he left me through.
The team has done a really excellent job to reach the first and second place," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body talk.
President Donald Trump laughed at the meeting on Saturday, Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence that she had not revealed the letters of Christine Blasey Ford, who had accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch the testimony of Ford before the Senate investigation committee, but instead he said that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are “loose, corrupt and false”.
“The only beautiful thing that could happen and which happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are wicked, corrupt and false,” he said.
"When you look at the publications and disclosures, people say, 'No, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose that?
Remember her answer... you disclosed the document... "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose it.'
Okay, wait a minute.
We revealed it... no, we didn't," he added about the impression of the senator.
Ford's letter on the charges against Kavanaugh sent in July, and the media were revealed in the beginning of September — but Feinstein denies that it came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charge, I didn't reveal her letter," she told the Commission after the report of Officer The Hill Feinstein.
"She asked me for confidentiality, and I kept him confidential, as she asked."
But apparently her denial did not match the president who said at the Saturday night meeting: “I tell you, it was a really bad body speaking.
It may not, but it was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen.”
In defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, which three women accused of inappropriate sexual behaviour, the President implied that the democrats are abused for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power with all the means possible.
You have seen evil, disgusting, they don't care who they are hurt and who they have to drive to the power and control," the president said after the mediaite website's report.

Air traffic controller allowed several hundred people to escape from the earthquake by his death.
The air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he sacrificed his life so that several hundred people could fly safely.
On Friday’s earthquake on Sulaveza, followed by tsunami, more than 800 people died and many were missing.
The area continues to stress strong earthquakes, and many people are captured in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although the collaborators fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a strongly busy control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
It remained in it that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the flightway, could be safely flying.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought he was scattering.
He died in the hospital later.
The representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved several hundred lives, reported the Australian media house ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter to get him from Ballipapan in Calimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
“When we hear this, our heart is marketing,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of death victims could reach thousands, since the State Aid for Disaster Mitigation said that access to towns in Donghala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
“The number of dead should have increased, since there were many bodies under ruins, but many of them could not be achieved” said the representative of the Agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The Palu, where the mass funeral would take place on Sunday, was devastated by waves of up to six meters.
Military and commercial planes provide assistance and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News: “Each minute the saving vehicle brings the body.
He's getting clean water.
Minimarkets are exhausted everywhere.’
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, which can become much worse.”
On Sunday, the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palo, instructing the national army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to fulfill all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?” According to CNN report.
Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lomboc at the beginning of this year, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesian Air Niugini is now saying that there is one person missing after the laguna shopping of the aircraft.
The airline, which managed the flights in the Pacific Laguna in Micronesia, now says that they miss one person after initially reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the flooding plane.
The Air Niugini announced on Saturday afternoon that there was a lack of male sex passenger.
In the aviation company, they have been told that they are cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in search for missing.
The invitation for more information on a passenger, such as his age or nationality, has not responded immediately.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when they tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
In the airline, it was said that there were eight passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, who were all stable.
The cause of screaming and the precise sequence of events remains unclear.
The airlines and the American Navy have reported that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the road.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the pist.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was very low.
“This is extremely good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that along with other passengers, he managed to swing through the stretching water to the airplane exits.
He said the stewards have caused panic and screamed, but he suffered a smaller head injury himself.
The American Navy said that the sailors who were nearby repairing the relief were also helped to help the sailing boat with which people were transferred to the land before the plane drowned in about 30 feet (100 feet) deep water.
Air Safety Network shows that in the last two decades, 111 people died in Papua-Nova Guinea, but this was the first accident that happened to Air Niugini.
The analyst has determined the time of the night when the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution presented its evidence on Saturday in a re-trial trial to a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The US Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert on the intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used the phone recordings to determine the movement of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessice Chambers, at the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received information on the location from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis and Chambers were at the night of her death, which opposed his previous claims, the Officer Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' time when he said he was with Michael Sanford's friend, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in the Sanford truck that night, he said he “lied because he was a [my] truck in Nashville. ”
The second inconsistent was that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew about two weeks.
The videos on the cell phone show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis, in the time of Chambers' death, deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He erased it from his life, ” Hale said.
The defense should present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the jury was to judge the trial later that day.

Another black girl?
The New York Nanny sues a couple because they fired her for a "racist" message
The New York Nanny sues a couple because they discriminatoryly forgive her after receiving the wrong sent message of her mother, complaining that she was “one black woman. ”
A couple denies the racist conduct and the lawsuit compared to "force".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when Giselle Maurice found that the black woman was arrived.
“NEEEEEEEEE JOŠ A MARK,” she wrote to her husband in her message, Mrs Plasco-Flaxman.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After discovering her failure, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "uncomfortable", she forgived Mrs. Maurice, saying that her dismissed nanny, who was Afro-American, had been doing a bad job, so she wanted to hire the Philippine, reported Officer New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received payment for one day of work, and then she and Uber sent her home.
Maurice now requests compensation from a couple in the Court of Justice of 350 USD per day for the six-month period for which it was first hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them, you know, these things are not done," she said about Post on Friday, and she added: "I know this is discrimination."
The couple responded to the charges of racism by claiming that Maurice's forgiveness was reasonable because they were afraid that they would no longer be able to trust her after regret.
“ Her wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
It's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco said about Post.
"Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were indecent, even if this happened wrong?
Your newborn?
Come on.
In comparison with the complaint with “expulsion”, Plasco said that his wife had born a child only two months ago and was in “a very difficult situation. ”
“Are you going to deal with someone like this?
This is not good," the investment banker added.
Although the court's proceedings are still in progress, the Court of Justice of Public Opinion on Social Networks has quickly condemned its behaviour and way of thinking.
The bookers of the Paddington Bear Stories were afraid that the readers would not connect to the speaking bear, revealed a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s acceptance, said: “It was hard to get into the skin of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to learn it now that Paddington has become an extraordinary success.”
She said that her father, who first worked as a camera for BBC before he received inspirations to write a child's book about a little toy bear, would be regretted when he rejected her work, added that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book “Grenko-Sweet”.
Regarding Paddington’s bear, described as “a very important member of our family, ” she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was such a man who did not like to praise, ” she said.
“But since the bear Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: You are proud of him, even though you do not do it yourself.
I think the Bear Paddington was looking at the same way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, the success always associated with the bear Paddington himself.”
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the landing, her daughter was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nica, where doctors tried to preserve her life for nothing.
“Nad regularly called to say that she really feels bad if she didn't expect this to happen”, said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received Nada's call, and he told me she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicinal products given to her doctors to continue pushing her heart were slowly taken and abandoned.
She's been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it all happens.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounding my family and people.
I really had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who has already been grieving about her daughter's loss, boarded on the plane with other passengers, not conscious of the trial that is passing.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had a head away, and all the time my faces were tears.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her.”
Woman's grieving beauty posters for suicide prevention on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved person because of suicide try to dismiss others to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on a valley bridge sticky posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers to which people can turn to support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 when he was depressed, and he killed himself when he was 18 years old.
“I don't want any parents to feel like me every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old in Lydney, said that her son was a promised cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lights every room.”
But before his death, he stopped working because he was “in a real dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found a cousin when he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly concerned that the domino’s effect will be activated. ”
Mrs. Davis made posters, “to let others know that there are people you can turn to and talk to them, even if it is a friend.
Don't sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Davies’ friend for several years, lost Marka, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He did not say that he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
On Christmas day, he was completely on the ground. When the children opened gifts, he did not have an eye contact with them or anything.”
She said that his death was a severe trauma for them, but it must be processed: “She cut a hole into the whole family.
She smashed us.
However, we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is hanging at the start of the FBI investigation in the air
"I had changed that if we could actually take what he asked for -- at the length and extent of a limited investigation, this might make us united," Mr Flake said on Saturday, and he added that he feared that the world was afraid that, due to a strong parential delay, "depreciated".
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his republic supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their resistance is due to the time in which the investigation would take place.
Until the interim elections that will take place on November 6 is only five weeks – if the Republicans are expected to cut badly, this will very weaken them in the attempt to elect the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has repeatedly called the senators to lobby to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who was working in the White House for Mr. Bush and presented by his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI's report is prepared?
A vote will take place in the senate currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can gather at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring a breakdown from the pat of position and the election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, said the South Korean Member.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to the data of the South Korean Ministry of Communities, said that last year 1127 people fled, compared to 2706 2011.
Mr Park said that the key factors were stricter border control between North Korea and China and the increase in the price required by human traffickers.
Pjongjang has not commented publicly on this.
The majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seul says that the border from the end of Korean war in 1953 has illegally crossed over 30,000 North Koreans.
Most of them flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a strongly secured demilitarized area between both Koreans.
China counts refugees for illegal migrants, not for refugees, and often repatriates them.
Relations between North and South — which are still technically still in war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongjang at the talks focused on the restraining negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the June historical meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on the efforts for the Korean leaf without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho declined the US sanctions from then.
“Without confidence from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, but in such circumstances we will not disarma ourselves unilaterally”, said Mr Ri, in the invitation of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi marked Brett Kavanaugh as “histerical” and says he is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
The minor leader of the Presentation House, Nancy Pelosi, has identified the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh as “histerical” and said that it is personally inappropriate for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosiova said so on Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can't think of another thing as if a woman, acting like this, was known as “hysterical””,” Kavanaugh's Thursday testimony before the Senate Investigation Commission commented on Pelosiev.
Kavanaugh denyed the accusations of sexually attacking Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the introductory statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and debating about his family and high school years of souls.
He also explicitly condemned democrats in the Commission, and he referred charges against himself as “grothestic and coordinated mutilation” organised by the liberals, angry because Hillary Clinton lost her presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosius said that he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony had proved that he should not be appointed as a Supreme Judge, since it showed that he was a party to the democrats.
"I think he discredited himself by such statements and the way he launched the Clintons and democrats," she said.
The question is whether she will try to file a constitutional charge against Kavanaugh if it is confirmed and the democrats will receive most in the representative home for a moment.
"I will say this -- if the Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court on which it is now," Pelossi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosiova said that she was concerned as a democratic concern about the possible Kavanaugh decision against the Law on Accessible Health Welfare or the case of Roe v. Wade, as it applies to the Conservative Judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question whether he would dismiss some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, party person to the court and expects us to say, ‘ Isn't that wonderful? ’ said Pelosius.
And a woman has to be screwed up.
This is a fair decline, after months and years of anger, and it cannot be expressed without crying.
“ We cry when we are angry, ” she told me 45 years later, Mrs. Steine.
"That doesn't seem rare to me, what do you think?"
She continued: “A woman who was also a crying director, but she developed a technique, when she was angry and cried, said to the person with whom she was talking to, ‘ I might feel sad to you because I cry.
I'm angry.'
And then she just continued.
It seemed great to me.”
The tears are partly permitted because people understand them wrong.
One of my most powerful memories from the early career, while I was still working in the office in which the men were prevailing, and I was once weeping in an unreasonable anger, the event was when an older woman grabbed me for my neck — a cold leader, who was always a bit afraid that pulled me up on the stairs.
“Don't let them see you crying,” she said.
"They won't understand you're angry.
They will think you're sad, and they'll rejoice that they have touched you."
Patricia Schroeder, former Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, cooperated with Gary Hart with his presidential candidature.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was detected by a jumping across the fence in a boat called Monkey Business and had to exit from the game, Mrs. Schroeder found that there was no reason why she couldn't run for the president alone.
“It was not a well-reasoned decision,” she said 30 years later in the laugh.
"Seven other candidates have been involved in the competition, and another was the last thing needed at the time.
Someone then named the game ‘Sneguard and seven thumbs’.’
As it joined the last campaign, it was delayed in the collection of funds, so she decided not to enter the competition unless she gathered 2 million USD.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave to men 1000 USD, only gave it 250 USD.
“Do they think I'm going to get a discount?” she wondered.
When she announced in the conversation that she would not start a formal campaign, the emotions — appreciation for people who supported it — were dissatisfaction with the system that made her so difficult to gather money and focus on the voters instead of the delegates, and the anger for sexism — was so overwhelmed that she began to breathe.
"We would think I had a nervous breakthrough," Mrs. Schroeder recalled the media reactions.
"We would think my official sponsor is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my tomb.
‘Is she crying?’
How the war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The initial trade war salves between the United States and China have been deaf, and although the battle has not been completed for a long time, experts say that the division between the countries could benefit Beijing.
Donald Trump, US President, launched the first warning in the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new goods tariffs worth 200 billion USD (150 billion GBP), which effectively means taxing half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has been revenged every time with equivalent reimbursement measures, last with tariffs of 5 to 10 per cent per US goods of 60 billion USD.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed to moving an eye for eye and will probably not be mixed soon.
In order to relieve Washington, China should agree on its demands, but the public removal of the United States for Chinese President Shi Jinping would be too disgraceful.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Peking knows to withdraw the right moves, the US pressures in trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Peking could create conditions that would initiate a economic shock in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought by now," said Abigail Grace, a professional collaborator focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is “prepared” to return to refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says she is ready to voluntary return to refugees, and asks for help in renewal of the country destroyed within more than seven years of the lasting war.
In the invitation of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moulem said that the situation in the country improved.
“The situation in the field today is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to sanctify the areas destroyed by terrorists to re-establish a normal state.
All the conditions are now met to return voluntarily to the country, which had to be abandoned because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Other six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moulem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in renewal of the desolated country.
He emphasized, however, that he would not accept the conditional aid or aid from the countries sponsored by the rebels.
Europe won a victory in Ryder's Cattle in Paris
The European team victory against the United States team with the final result of 16,5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field in Paris in France won Ryder's Shop for 2018.
