The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that they “seem like muppets ”
Part of the members of the Assembly are amazed by the proposal that their invitation to be changed to the "CUP" (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal is provoked by plans to change the name of the Wales Parliament Assembly.
The members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this may become a cause for laughing.
One of the liberists said that his group was concerned that the new name was "Rome with the Tup and the Dube".
For readers outside Wells: In welsh this is definitely offensive.
According to one of the members of the Plaid, the entire group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
The representative of the welsh Conservative Party pointed out that his group was "not prejudiced" to the change of the title, but notes that the new name of the HRP (English-MWP) has a certain wordlike similarity with "mupette".
In this context, welsh letter W is said like the English yorkshire phrase of U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the black draft law to change the name, made the following statement: “Of course, the final decision for all the description titles called members of the Assembly will belong to the members themselves.”
The Law on the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public interview on the proposals by which the Assembly was established a wide support to start calling “Wels' parliament”.
As far as its members' duties, the Commission prefers “the members of the Wales Parliament, shortly the CHP,” but the CHUP option has received the greatest support after the questioning of the society.
The members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching consensus will clearly be the headache for President Ellen Jones, which is expected to submit the black on the draft change by a few weeks.
The reforming legislation will include other changes in the way the Assembly works, i.e. the rules for discvalification of its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when they reach the discussion of the draft law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum whether to change their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was planned to resolve the forthcoming decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, in which there is an administrative area named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its north neighbour is a claim to the Greek state territory and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is a opponent of the referendum on the change of state's name, said that you would not read the vote.
Nevertheless, the referendum supporters, including President Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the country's name is just a price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells shut down on the background of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"If we look at the historic plan, according to the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner," Mr. Adams says.
"Today both have disappeared."
Adams says the extinction of the bars is understandable.
"The people today are socialized in different ways," he added.
"The bars are no longer the quarters of the daily, where everyone is gathering regularly."
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of assets will not reach as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later will be in the same situation.”
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments where people who do not help survive the other sanctuarys of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white, which will accelerate the closing process of these churches, as it is not particularly likely most of the new settlers to visit them."
Both churches were built by white pastes before Harlem turned into a neighbourhood of black people – the Metropolitan community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white methodistic patch was carried out in years after 1930.
Then the building became the property of black people in the neighborhood.
St. Martin was poet by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a fightcott against traders on a small 125th street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire black workers.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire damages, but Father Johnson's enorias had a plan for its restoration, which ordered the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson’s son and heir of St. Martin, proudly calls them “poor bells. ”
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: “Cultural treasure ” and“ unreplaceable historical instrument. ”
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ngu from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first system of bells in the world used by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger system in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mariewood mentions that from St. Martin, they have never replaced it.
What happened in St. Martin in the past few weeks was a complex tale that was embedded by architects and performers, some brought by the world leaders of the church, and others from the episcopic episode.
From the newsletter, which is the governing body of the public, consisting of world leaders, wrote to the eparchy in July, expressing their concern that the eparchy would "were to transfer the costs of the newsletter", although it had no role in renting of architects and performers sent by the eparchy.
Some enorias have complained of the lack of transparency by the eparchya.
A 13-year-old child was injured by shark hunting lobsters in California
The shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while it was diving for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, the representative authorities reported.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beachen's beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel shared in front of KSWB-TV in San Diego that he dived up with friends about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and went in with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought that the kid had caught a lobster and was excited, and then realized how he was screaming “He bite me!
He bit me!"
Hammel says that when he got to the boy, he realized that the whole area of his key was broken.
"I cried for everyone to go out of the water, for there is a shark," Hamel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the work hospital in San Diego, where it was taken critically.
He's still not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
The savior Captain Larry Jills said to the media briefing that a few weeks earlier in the water, a shark was seen, but it was estimated not from a dangerous species.
Jills adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the top of his body.
The responsible authorities closed access to the coastal line from the beach Ponto in Kazablád to Swaomi in Encitinas for 48 hours of security reasons while the investigation is under way.
Jills notes that there are more than 135 types of sharks in the area, most of which, however, are not a threat to humans.
Sainsbury plans an offensive on the British market for decoration products
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening stands for decorative products in its objects, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the decorative products market in Great Britain, which is estimated to 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while the sales of fashion and household products are reduced, the largest bars for decoration products will be placed in the 11 shop throughout the country, after which, with the success of the initiative, these will be discovered in other objects.
Investment in the decorative sector is made at the moment where supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the stellages recently taken by televisions, microwave furnaces and other household devices.
Sainsbury said they would double the number of proposed decoration products to 3000 products, with the first inclusion of marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Current product gammas from L'Oreal, Mordalline and Burt's Bees will also receive more place, like the proposals in boots shops.
The supermarket also restarts its bottle gamma makeups so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly required from younger users.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume trader will test discount programs in two Sainsbury shops, the first of whom he opened in Croyden, South London last week, until the second will be discovered in Sally Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and moving focus on shopping smaller amounts of food daily in convenient moments leads to the need for supermarkets to make more effort to attract buyers.
Mike Cope, Chief Executive Director of Sainsbury, shared that the objects would look more like universal shops, while the chain of supermarkets is trying to overcome the Aldi and Lidl drives, offering more services and non-food goods.
From Sainsbury, they have objects of Argos in hundreds of shops, as well as opening the Habitats objects since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims to have increased the sales of food goods and made profits even more profitable.
The previous experience of the chain of supermarkets to prefassionalize its objects for colorful and pharmaceutical products has failed.
Sainsbury did a compatible experience with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after the dispute for the distribution of profits from pharmaceutical company objects in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business with 281 Celesio object, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds ago three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will have a role in the plan by providing a rich gamma luxury marks for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, Sainsbury’s commercial director, made the following statement: “We have transformed the type and character of our beautiful stands to improve the overall experience of our clients.
We also invested in special training of our colleagues, who will offer professional advice in place.
The proposed gamma marks aims to respond to every taste and all necessary in a captive situation with a comfortable location, and this combination turns us into an attractive destination for decorative products that challenges the concept of the old shopping way itself."
Peter Jones "free" after Holly Wilbey's cancellation of a deal for 11 million pounds
The star of Dragons Den Peter Jones "was insulted" after the TV leading Holly Wilbey quit a deal for 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wilbey doesn't have time for the mark of household devices and accessories Truly.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop mark of Guinet Poltrow.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced her leave in Instagram.
Holly Wilbey left the star from Dragons Den Peter Jones "to kip" after retrieving from their income business with a leafstyle mark in the last minute – to focus on its own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones "was mad" when the "Gold Girl" on TV recognized during a tense meeting on Tuesday in his business empire center in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that its new contracts -- worth up to 1,5 million pounds, means that there will be no more time for his mark of household products and accessories Truly.
The business is similar to the Goop Mark of Guinet Poltrow, and the rumors are that it doubled Wilbey's wealth, whose value is projected to the 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Wilobi announced in Instagram his leave on Truly, Jones left Britain with a plane to go to one of his vacational propertys.
One of the sources shared: “Truly was Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to ensure her future in the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the cooks absolutely all unprepared.
No one believed that this could happen Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse full of waiting for products to be sold in Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leading “This morning”, which is one of the most successful stars of Britain, could cost the company millions due to the large investment in products varieting from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, as well as may lead to delaying in the market Mark.
And not in the last place, it can also mean the end of a sudden long friendship.
Wilbey, who's mother of three children, and her husband Dan Boldwin is a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willobi itself founded Truly with Cap in 2016, as Jones, who was 52, joined as chairman of the company in March.
Both families often go on holidays together, and Jones has 40% of Baldwin's TV producership company.
Willoby will become an ambassador of the M&S mark and will also replace Anne McParlin as a leader of the "I am a celebrity" on ITV.
The source close to Jones made last night the following statement: “We will not comment on his business. ”
Hard negotiations leading to “the heating of relations”
He jokes about the criticisms he would take from the press channels for commenting, which someone would consider "not suitable for the president" and as too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump take so much back?
Trump answered in his joking "new" way.
"I didn't retreat anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first one held in Singapore in June and was declared Trump "a great step to remove North Korea's nuclear weapons".
But the negotiations to remove this weapon are delayed.
For more than three months after the youth meeting in Singapore, the diplomat of North Korea Ri Jung Ho informed the representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea "does not see reciprocal relations" by the United States to the first steps of his country on the way of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues with sanctions that aim to maintain the tension.
Trump presented a much more optimistic view of things in his speech.
"Our relationship with North Korea is wonderful," he noted.
"We were headed to war with this country.
They'd have killed millions of people.
Instead, we now enjoy beautiful relationships."
The President said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results – termination of missiles tests, release of hostages and returning to the home of the bodies of American military officers.
He has also protected his neortodoxal approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to behave as president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this overflowing zone, we would have about 200 people right there," Trump said, pointing the crowd ahead of us.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia desolate the island and lead to hundreds of deaths
Following the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations have declared that they do not need them.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population were forced to leave their housing, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for international assistance.
"Regretably, in many cases, there is an unsubstantiated opinion that there is no international assistance that makes things slightly challenging," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the "Save Children" forms a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the country's territory.
The national rapporteur of the disaster agency Mr. Sutopo announced that the Indonesian authorities are currently evaluating the situation in Palu in order to decide whether international agencies are allowed to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Given the permanent earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains so unprepared for such natural disasters.
Although there were asylums in Acheh in the case of tsunamis, they were not often seen on the other coasts.
The apparent lack of a warning siren for tsunami in Palu has likely contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters even more complicate this logistics.
Recently stationed in Lomboc for the service of the victims of the earthquake, the hospital ship went to Palu, but it would be at least three days before he could reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joco Vidodo has converted the improvement of Indonesia's remaining infrastructure to the centre of its pre-electoral campaign, investing a large amount of funds in roads and railway lines.
But the insufficient finances constantly harass his office, while Joco is re-opening the urnas in the next year.
Mr. Joco is also under pressure, born by continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting on the streets with cats, bowels and arrows, as well as other original weapons.

Chelsea took 1-0 in the 25th minute after the naked on his Belgian star One Azar.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue becomes the latest memorial hit by "Rewrite History"
Her ban will be poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artefacts, which was done by his fanatic puritanic followers.
Ala "Cromwell's Society" described Mr. Creek's proposal as "lude" and "the attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in this debate to remove the statues of Oliver Cromwell to the Westminster Palace to become a target.
The Economy of English Civil Wars has not been ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornikroft is a proof of the opinion in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still consider as worthy respect.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “The Cromewel is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, a parliament defender against external pressure, and it is, of course, a monarchy in his case.
Whether this is a complete exact presentation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is sure is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, which formed the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clear recognised person, which represents the one side of the coming division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve the celebration and honor."
A pig killer wounds a deadly Chinese farmer
The farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in Southwest China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his name as Juan, was found dead with a discontinued arteries and covered in blood close to the Liupanschoui market in Guayjou province, reported on Sunday South China Morning Post.
The pig was preparing to inject his pigs with vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Sinin of Cinhai Province, China.
He was supposed to arrive with his cousin from the neighbouring province Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also stopped the door to the neighbouring cock open.
He also reported that there was a big male pig in the cart.
The judicial expertise confirmed that 550 pounds of pig attacked the farmer fatally, reports the report.
“My cousin's step was bleeding and distorted, ” states Cousin Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera recording shows how Juan goes to the market at 4:40 Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he could not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It is also reported that the Yuan family and market leadership are negotiating compensation for the death case.
Although they're rare, it's already reported for pigs that attack people.
In 2016, a pig attacked his wife and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man was injured with critical injuries.
Ten years before that 650 pound pigs put a welsh farmer on his tractor, while his wife managed to chase him.
After the Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of the blood can influence them as a "bounce".
"They just play.
The pigs are like little kids, extremely curious... they don't mean to hurt anyone.
But also a person should treat them with respect," the man ends.
The weakening hurricane Rosa will lead to common and spilling rains in the southwest of the United States
According to the weather forecast, hurricane Rosa weakens while moving over the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next days, Rosa will lead to flood rains in northern Mexico and Southwest United States.
Rosa includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is a hurricane of category 1, counting up to 5 o'clock Sunday east time and is located 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
During that time, over the Pacific, it starts to form a synclinal that moves east to the west coast of the United States. Rosa approaches the Baha California half island on Monday, under the form of a tropical storm, will begin to elevate the tropical moisture deep north to the southwest of the United States.
In Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
In the next few days, the tropical moisture together with the coming synclinal will create common heavy rains in the southwest.
At the local level of 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and fast floods, carrying fractures of streams and possibly seals in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to vacuums between 2 and 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, it is expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially above the majority of Arizona.
It is possible that there are floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rain.
It will be extremely unreasonable to travel a paw in the desert when there is a threat from tropical rains.
The heavy rain can turn the canyons into rainfall rivers, and the thunderstorms will lead to a raised dust and scattered winds.
The nearing synclinal will lead to heavy rains in some parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach a scale of over half a inch, which will lead to minor waste flows and slippery roads.
It'll be the first rain season.
Late Sunday and early Monday, clouds that carry tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger zone on Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over four corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October can bring great temperature hesitations in the United States while the Arctic Ocean is cold, but the tropical remains warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday, there is an excellent example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There is about 20 degrees of temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to increase and expand.
In the majority of the central and eastern United States, it is expected to have a warm beginning in October, and from the south east to the part of the northeast, it is expected to overcome temperatures of about 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people were watching Brett Cavanau's hearing.
More than 20 million people looked on Thursday on six TV networks, the fascinating spectrum of the testimony for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanou and Christine Blacey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual attack, which took place in the 1980s of the 20th century.
During that time, political opposition continued, while networks interrupted their regular reverse programs in the last minute of Friday: an agreement that was arranged by the Arizonan Senator Jeff Flake, and according to which the FBI has to conduct a weekly investigation on the charges.
Ford said before the Senate Court that she was 100% convinced that Kavanu had pushed her drunk and tried to take her clothes off during the high school party.
Cavanou, in his emotionless testimony, is absolutely categorical that such a thing has never happened.
It's probably even more than the Nelsen number of 20.4 million viewers reported on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no direct data available for other networks that broadcasted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nelsen in tradition experiences difficulties with the measurement of a number of people who look from their jobs.
In comparison, we're talking about audience, similar to the size of the championship football game or the Hollywood Prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanu, is the first among all networks with a average of 5,69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, reports Nelsen.
ABC was a second with 3.26 million audiences.
According to Nelsen CBS, it had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.2 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the office of a moderate republican came out with a declaration that he would vote in favour of Kavanu, CNN and CBS cameras took a shot on Friday as protesting as he was trying to catch the elevator for the meeting of the Judicial Committee.
During all the turmoil for a few minutes, he hasn't raised eyes from the ground that was transmitted live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he represents the truth before the country?
"You have power, while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Flake replied that his office had already exited the declaration, and before closing the elevator's doors, he reported that it would be said further during the hearing by the committee.
The cable and emission networks have secured a dense coverage on live a few hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to decide whether to transfer the nomination to the full voting Senate.
Alla Flake reported that he would do this only if he was sure that the FBI would review the charges against nominations next week, which the democrats insisted on opposition.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the senator from the Democratic Party, Chris Couns.
After talking to Cones and a few Senator Fleck made a decision.
His choice was definitely important, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have sufficient votes for the approval of Kavanu without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to examine the charges against Cavanau.
British Prime Minister Mae accuses criticists of "political plays" with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa Mei accused the criticism of her plans for leaving the European Union of "political plays" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in interview with the Sunday Times.
The British President Teresa Mei arrived for the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published with her on the first page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has strengthened its attack on her so-called "Lady Game Plan" for Brexit, suggesting that the collection of customs taxes from Britain for the EU and the opposite is "completely absurd".

Ditian Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned in charge of murder from the second degree, the police office in Baton Rouge reported.
The officials presented a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and the police reported that Simms lost his glasses during the battle.

The Director of Athletic Sports of LSU Joe Aleva thanks the local law enforcement authorities for "temporary justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The high 6 feet and 6 inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.

On Friday morning, LSU Wil Wade basketball coach reported that the team was "shit" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said that “this is something that is anxious all the time. ”
Vulcan scatters ashes over Mexico City
The ashes of Popocathepetel from the volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater increased and in the last 24 hours 183 gas and ashes were registered.
The center was watching a lot of shakes and shakes.
Published in social networks photos show a thin layer of dust that covers the front glass of the cars in some of the neighborhoods of Mexico City, for example in Hokimilko.
The geophysics have noted an increase in the volcanic activity, located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital, since the earthquake with magnitude 7,1 shook Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police faced Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after the protesters for independence encountered the gendarmeria, when thousands joined the opposing demonstration of the first anniversary of the Polarising One for Catalunia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmeria, began to mitigate peacekeeping guards with eggs and powder paint, creating dark and dust clouds on the streets that are usually tourists.
Later in the day there were other conflicts with the police, and the police fled to their sticks to control the situation.
During hours supporting independence, groups shouted "We don't forget, we don't forgive", while the country's reservation claims returned with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that, as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical assistance for small injuries.
The tension remains high in the desired independence region even a year after the holding of a referendum on 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist catalans.
The vast majority voted whether they voted for independence, although the activity was low, since most opponents of the cutting boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the voter sections in the region with a number of burdens.
The demanding independent groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was made, but it was forced to pass a different route.
Narciss Termes, an electrician, joined the separatist protest with his wife, says that there is no hope of Katalunia's chances to get independence anymore.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy when they could vote, but now it seems we're stuck," the man added.
Despite the important victory, whether at the regional elections in December last, the supporting independence of Catalunia political parties experience difficulties this year, since many of their most famous leaders are either in self-restrained or are arrested in the expectation of the process for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, claims that the conflict has been provoked by politicians and both sides.
His comment is that “he's getting more tense.”
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested catalan leader in anticipating the preliminary process last year, announced that he would be at the European Parliament's elections next year.
He claims that "my candidature for European elections is the best way to resist the repression of the democratic values and repressions we observe by the Spanish government".
Londonders: Arrested men after the car crashed in the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car hit himself in a house in Londonderi several times.
The incident happened in Ballynagar Crescent Thursday around 19:30 British time.

It's also possible that the car was shot by a bullet.
Goal of Menga brings Livingston's victory with 1-0 over Rangers.
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston secured the victory
The newman in the League of Livingston surprised the Rangers and caused only the second loss of Stephen Gerard at his first 18th match as an Ibrox Club manager.
The goal of Dolly Menga turned out to be decisive, and Gary Holt's team was equal to the second in the Hybernian classification.
Gerard's team remains without winning a foreign field in the High League during this season, and next Sunday he's faced the leader Harts, from whom he left eight points in classification.
But before that, Rangers is the host of Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone is already in a series of six matches without loss in the championship, and the manager Holt has not felt the taste of the loss since he changed Kenny Miller's post last month.
Livingstone has missed good opportunities against the guests without anxiety.
Holt's team had to lead the results far before marking the naked, and his direct style of the game made the Rangers extremely difficult.
Scott Robinson broke the defense, but his hit went sideways, and Alan Litgow shot the board after Craig Halket got the ball back to him.
The households let Rangers play the ball, knowing that they could seriously disturb the guests from static situations.
And that's how you got to the winning naked.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, like Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined each other and took Menga, who took his ball and noted from the middle of the criminal field.
Until that moment, the Rangers had the ball more, but they were facing the inexperienceable protection of the hosts, and Liam Kelly's doorman was rarely to interfere.
This game style continued in the second half time, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
The Rangers' gateway saved Scott Pittman's leg shot, and a hit with Littlelow's head passed by the door after another statistical situation for Livingston.
In Livingstone's penalty field, however, the centres were easily cleaned, and the judge twice did not respect the claims of guests for a racing – first after the singleship between the Halket and the Glen Midlton reserve, and then with doubts about the game with hand.
“Fenomental” of Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on “Tony Macaroni Arena”
A phenomenal game and a wonderful result for Livingston.
The team just plays great, continuing to overcome the expectations and improve its presentation.
The style of the game and the composition had hardly suffered changes after the return of the team to the High League, but Holt deserves a great commendation for the way you transformed the team after your appointment.
He has real heroes on the ground.
Captain Halkett was incredible, organizing the defense in an excellent way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell under pressure.
At the same time, Rangers didn't show anything inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they're demonstrating some great things, but in the case, they were very under these standards.
They missed the last passage before naked, only once they managed to break the protection of the household – this loss should wake the Rangers who are currently in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan gets a mixed receipt in Köln
On Saturday (September 29th) we became witnesses of smiles and blue spaces when Turkish and Germany leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's contrary visit to Germany, which aims to fix relations between NATO allies.
Friendly relationship is cold because of problems affecting human rights, freedom of the media and the adoption of Turkey in the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Colon to find a huge new mosque.
The city is a home for the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented the 25,000 crowds from gathering in front of the mosque, but there were still many supporters who wanted to see their president.
Thousands protesting against Erdogan, many of whom Kurds also raised a vote, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to allow it to the country.
Different protests reflect the fracture caused by a visitor who is considered hero by some German Turks and is contemplated as a desp of others.
Travel disaster in Deptford: A rider rests after a car struggle
The coach died after the car struggle in London.
The catastrophe came near the block of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a loaded road to Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 in the morning of British time.
The driver of the car stopped and arrived in medical care, but the driver died in the spot.
The catastrophe happens a few months after another rider died, after he was punched by a fugitive driver on Childers Street, located near a mile from the place of Saturday disaster.
The capital police informed her employees working on the identification of the man, and then informing his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are discarded, and it is also recommended that motorists avoid the zone.
Prison Long Lartin: Six Overseers are injured in a riot
Six prison overseers were injured in a male prison with high safety level, reports the prison service.
The rebellion exploded in prison Long Lartin in Warchester at nearly 9:30 a British time on Sunday and continues.
In order to control it, special officers from the Tordano team are called to deal with eight deprived persons, as well as the rebellion itself in limited to one prison wing.
The injured overseers have suffered mild injuries on their faces and have received medical assistance in place.
The speaker of the Prison Service made the following statement: “Special trained officers are called to deal with the incident in prison Long Lartin.
Six overseers have received medical assistance.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and make it very clear that the responsible persons will be transferred to the police, and their sentences may be extended."
In prison, there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that after the prisoner's attack, the prison director had to be treated in the hospital.
Also, in October last year, police officers from the fighting parts were called to jail, where they could control a severe riot where the staff was attacked with billard balls.
The hurricane Rosa threatens with a flash flood of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although dried areas may benefit)
Arizona rarely happens to be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a great probability that this will happen early next week, while the weakening hurricane Rosa is carried through the southwestern desert, leading to a risk of floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already established posts against flood floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, south and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including in Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different way over Finnisk on Tuesday, and late Monday can bring rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “from 1950 only ten tropical cycles have held tropical storms within 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Centre foresees 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern wilderness, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Pool, will probably receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, and in different places there are up to 4 inches of swimming.
For those who are not threatened by floods caused by Rosa can actually be a blessing, since the region is severely affected by the drought.
Although the floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain is likely to be useful, since the southwest part is now in the drought.
According to the US Drying Period Commission, a little over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least an excessive drought, which is the second weighing category," weather.com reported.
First, the road of the hurricane Rosa leads to the land at Baha California half island in Mexico.
Rosa, which can still be praised on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets colder waters over the Pacific and therefore weakens.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the land in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over the part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of compensation.
“The summary rains are expected from up to 6 inches from Baha California to northwest Sonora, as possible up to 10 inches” reports the weather.com.
Rosa will then go north in Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona to South Utah until Tuesday late night.
"The basic risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely strong rain in Baha California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," warned the National Centre for Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening floods and carrying various waste flows in the desert, as well as decorations in mountains.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempting murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempts in murder after a 16-year-old child was discovered with injury in the Summerset.
The wounded boy was discovered in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
It is located in a hospital where his condition remains "stable".
During the night in the area Radstock, a boy was arrested at 17, two boys 18 and a 20-year-old man, reported by the Aven and Summerset police.
The police ask everyone who might have taken a picture of what happened, to contact them.
Trump says Kavanou "was suffered from anger and anger" of the Democratic Party
"Each vote for Judge Cavanau is a voice that rejects fraud and disgusting tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump announced that Cavanau had been "faithful and anger" of the democratic party during his nomination.
Cavanou testifies before the Congress on Thursday, cautiously rejecting Christine Blacey Ford's accusation of sexual assault decades ago when two were teenagers.
Ford also testifies during the hearing of the charge.
The President made a statement on Saturday that “the American people today have witnessed intelligence, courage and quality” of Kavanu.
"Each vote in support of Judge Kavanu is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in public service," the president said to the gathered crowds from Western Virginia.
The President indirectly visualizes the nomination of Kavanu while he talked about the importance of the Republican votes for the general elections.
"They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I'm not a candidate, I'm actually involved," Trump continued.
"This is why I go around and fight in support of good candidates."
Trump noted that the democrats had set up a mission "to interrupt and obstacle."
The first key procedure is expected to be held in the Senate for the nomination of Kavanu, not later than Friday, as one of the top representatives of the Republican Party reported to CNN.
Thousands die after earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims grows
At least 384 people lost their lives, after many were taken away from the minor coast of giant waves, when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island Sulavesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered together for the beach festival in Palu on Friday, when at night the coast was waveed from waves up to six feet (18 feet), taken many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami peaks after the earthquake with a magnet of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and have not escaped immediately, which has made many victims of the disaster," said the briefing at Jacarda Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesian BNPB.
"The water pulled cars, trees, houses, defeated everything on its way," continued Nugroho and added that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hit the shore.
"Some people climbed down the trees and thus managed to save themselves from the water," he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palu.
Published by the Air Disaster Photos Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and stores, broken and drilled bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
Secondary shoes continued to swing the coast city on Saturday day.
The order of earthquakes was experienced in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Apply Agency (BPPT) announced that the energy released from the Friday massive earthquake was approximately 200 times stronger than the Hyroshima atomic bomb during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical accommodation of the city, which is at the end of the long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho describes the damage as "velike" and defines that thousands of houses, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the screwed buildings, added the speaker, and then added that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the victims and damages could be higher on the coast of 300 miles (190 miles) north of Palu, a area called Donggala, which is closer to the cucumber epicenter.
He also added that “communications are completely intersected and no information from Donggala”.
The Red Cross, on its own, indicated that more than 300,000 people live there, added that his teams and volunteers have already traveled to the affected zones.
"It's a tragedy, but it can make it even more difficult."
On Saturday, the Agency was angryly criticised that she had not informed Palu tsunami's defeat, although the officials explained that the waves arrived during the announcement of the message.
Shared in social networks, lovers videos show a man on the top floor of the building who screams people on the street of panic warnings about the nearing tsunami.
In a few minutes, a huge water wall is sliding into the coast and treats both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami have led to a severe interruption of electricity, which stopped the communications around Palu and thus difficulted the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the assistance of Jacarda and other cities, reported by the responsible authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other products of the first need.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joco Vidodo will visit the evacuation centres in Pali on Sunday.
The deaths in the Indonesian tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While the workers of the World Vision of Donggala have managed to get safe to Palu, where they have found a shelter in the shelter shelters, scattered in the courtyard of their office, they have passed a number of scenes of desolation, says Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the starting work on emergency and recovery operations, some complain that they have a rich experience in such situations, foreign rescueers are prevented from reaching Palu.
In accordance with the Indonesian Regulations, the financing, the sending of staff and abroad supplies can only be started if the defeated place is declared as a zone of national disaster.
And this hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still at the regional level," said Aulia Ariani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government announces that it is a national disaster, we can accept international assistance, but they have not yet announced that statute."
While the second night after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, the friends and families of those who are still in unknown, continue to hope of a miracle and that their loved ones have somehow survived after natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who was buried under the ruins for two days with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's national paraplanerism team, trained two of the missing paraplaneters for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the trapped in the Roa Roa Roa hotel were his students, added Mr. Mandagi.
"As elders in the paraplanerism field, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours after the news of the crash of the Roa Roa Roa has reached the communities on paraplanerism, he desperately sent messages to whatsApp to the competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue bookmarks, however, the only answer to his messages was one-one grey.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he added.
Thieves raise 26 750 dollars during loading a banknote in Newport of Levi
On Friday morning, the thieves raised $26,750 from Brink's employee, who charged a banknote in Newport of Levi, became clear from the press of the police office in Newport.
The car driver bleached the bankomate in the entertainment complex and was preparing to load it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “clicked near the back of Brink's employee ” and stole a cash bag.
The Witnesses noticed many suspects to flee the scene, continued the message, but the police did not indicate the number of people involved in the robbery.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the suspect must contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanie West: The Rapper Changes His Name on Ye
The Rapper Kanie West has changed his name to Ye.
Together with the announcement of the change in Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man known officially as Kanie West.”
West, 41, has been carrying the name Ye for a while and used it as a title for his eighth album, which was issued in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He's changing Ariana Grande's singer in the show, which has denied "for emotional reasons," the artist of the show informed us.
In addition to the shortening of his current professional name, West has before claimed that the word is religiously important to him.
"I believe that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "ye" or "ye", West shared earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with the Big Boy Radio.
"That's how I am you, I am us, it's us.
It passed from Canya, which means only one person, just Ye – which is a reflection of good in us, evil, confusion, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of our being."
The rapper is one of the many known in his sphere that changed his name.
Sean Combs has a series of nicknames and names, including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Deedy, but this year he announced his preferences to the alias Lions and Brader Lions.
One of West's previous colleagues, J.Z., was also presented in an option with or without tire and/or main letters in his nickname.
The president of Mexico swears not to use the army against civilians.
The newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he would never use military forces, which happened until the country was nearing the 50th anniversary of bloody reppressions against students.
On Saturday, Tlatelolko Plaza President Lopez Obrador promised "will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people".
The soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration on the square on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with left political views gradually spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador oathed to support young Mexicans, providing monthly scholarships for students and finding more free public universities.
The President also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attracts young people to criminal gangs.
The United States must double the financing of the II development
At the moment when China becomes increasingly active on the front of the development of artificial intelligence, the United States must double its research budget in this area, the researcher and developer of II Kai-Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was sent after the United States government's different links made statements on the topic of II, although the United States generally does not have an official I.I. strategy.
During that time China presented its plan last year: the country seeks to become number 1 from innovation in the II by 2030.
"Dubling the II budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and are about to make the following breakthroughs in relation to the II," Lee claims.
The double funding can also double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of the II to come from the United States, as Lee informed the CNBC in the interview last week.
Lee, whose book “China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the principal Executive Director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the largest II companies in China – Face++.
In the 1980s of the last century, Carnegie Melan Lee worked on the I.I. system, which won the most successful hotel player in America, after which he was an executive director at Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee pays the duty of the previous technological competitions of the federal government, such as the racing on robotics of the Agency for improved research projects on the defence, and asks when will be the next one that will help identify new visioners.
"The US researchers often need to work hard to gain government funding," stated Lee.
"Not China takes the academic leaders, but the corporates," the man claims.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired university lights to work on II.
Lee also claims that changes in immigration policy can help the United States to strengthen its II programme.
"I believe that the doctors of II science should automatically offer green cards," the man claims.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people from academic institutions like the way the National Scientific Foundation and other state organisations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee acknowledged.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defence established a Joint Intelligence Centre, which aims to include partners from the industry and the academic environment, and the White House announced the establishment of the Special Intelligence Commission.
Also, this month DARPA reported an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF, they are currently investing more than 100 million dollars a year in the development of II.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislative authority, who wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Art Intelligence, has not not noted any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum whether to change their country's name
Macedonia's citizens voted in a referendum this week whether the name of the State should change to the Republic of Northern Macedonia. This is a move that would authorize the forthcoming decades of dispute with Greece, which blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is a area called Macedonia, argues that the name of its north neighbour is a claim against its territorial integrity, which is why it has a veto of its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonia.
President Georgie Ivanov said that he himself would not vote in the referendum, while the boycott campaign casts a shadow of doubt whether the referendum would succeed in reaching the minimum 50 per cent required for recognition of his validity.
The issue of the bulletins is: "Do you support membership in NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the shift of the name, including President Zoran Zaev, argue that their price is worth paying in order to achieve the entry of the formed after the decline of the Yugoslav State of Macedonia in organisations like the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live free under the rainfall of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old Citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of the Parliament have said that they will comply with the result of it to the extent that the vocabulary already has a critical weight.
In order to change the name of the State, two thirds of the parliamentary representatives should therefore vote.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the electoral activity was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters visited the urnas.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Giose Tanevski, a citizen of 62 of the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Duško voted at the referendum in Macedonia for a change in the name of the country, which will find the way to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, at 54, prepared a small scene and set up chairs in front of the tents captured by the boycotting referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the servants' door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our state may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev claims that NATO membership will lead to the investment necessary for Macedonia, since unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the huge majority will be with us because over 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zeev reported after I released my own voice.
The state also stated that the positive result would lead to “the strengthening of the future of our people”.
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Surveys published the results of the study, according to which between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the necessary activities.
Another study, the case of Macedonian TV Telma, announced that 57% of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote with "Yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum is unsuccessful, this will be the first serious strike against the pro-western government's policy since it won the power last May.
Look: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City crosses the entire defense of Bryton and marks goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling overcome the protection of Bryton and brought the Manchester City victory with 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stedium in Manchester, England.
The play of Aguero for his naked in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalman was found with a dog in the middle of the field.
He runs three defenders from Bryton before sprinting with the ball in the empty space forward.
Then Aguero became surrounded by four green players.
He walked past one of the defendants, then left behind the remaining on the boundaries of Briton's criminal field.
Then he put on the left to Sterling.
The English attacker, with one touch, returned the ball back to Aguero, who hit the right foot over the doorman of Briton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
"Aguero fights with some injuries in his legs," reported the reporter's manager of City Pep Guardiola.
"We planned he to play about 55 to 60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky you noticed the naked at the moment."
But Sterling was the one who provided the initial advance of the "nebes" at this game of the High League of England.
He signed the 29th minute.
In the naked Aguero situation, he got a subtle submission in half of Bryton.
He immediately released the left flag pass to Leroy Sane.
Sane advanced with the ball, and then found Sterling with a dog on the distant grey.
The attacker of the unbelievers managed to detect closely, shortly before the ball came out.
City will face Hoffenheim at the group phase of the Championship League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon on Rayne Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to play the destiny of Rockies
After the Nationals didn't classify for the playoffs, there's no special sense for another game of the title-launcher.
Still, the ambitious Shercer is always hoping to be a title on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the game is important for Rockies who are taking a game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the classification of NL West.
Rockies guaranteed their participation at least in the Wild Card game after victory with 5-2 against Nationals on Friday night, but it is still uncertain that they will win their first title in the Division.
"Although we do not fight for anything ourselves, we want to finish the season with a nice game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will give everything they can to win the most important match for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss a game like that?"
Nationals still have not announced the starting bicker for Sunday, but it is assumed that they would allow Shercer to participate if the match was decisive.
For Shercer, this would be the 34th match as the starting bicker this year, when he spent his training on Thursday and would have the normal time for rest till Sunday.
The right-handed Washington beecher has a balance of 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 striques in 220 2/3 ining during this season.
Trump calls supporters in Western Virginia
The President has indicated the situation with his elected man for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanu while he talked about the importance of the Republican votes in the general elections.
"In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
There's five weeks left to one of our most important choices in our life.
This is one of the biggest moments in the present history - I also claim that, although I am not a candidate, I am in reality also involved, that's why I'm fighting all the powers for the right candidates," Trump said.
Then continued with "All you see this horrible, horrible radical group of democrats, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to return their power in any way, you are witnessing their insomnia, their evil.
They do not care when they can injure whom they need to cross in order to get in the power and governance, because they are only interested in power and governance, but we will not give them."
The Democrats, according to the president's words, have set up their goal "to interrupt and obstacle."
"What we all see in the last four days," he continued, calling the democrats "anger, nasty, malicious and unfaithful."
The president reminded the Senate Judicial Commission, mentioning the senator of Democrats Diane Finstein in a name, which caused a strong motion from the crowd.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you disseminate the documents?
Excuse me, what?
No, no, I waited -- it was really bad gesture -- perhaps the worst I've ever seen."
The laiberists are no longer broadcast.
The party is not tolerant to those who speak openly
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last member of the parliament of the labyrists to whom it was said he was not welcome - just because I was honest.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, got a similar attitude, since she strongly faced antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, the subjects that are ironicly similar to those with whom Jeremy expressed disagreement during the time of the previous leaders.
The report on the meeting of the Labyrians at Nottingham East on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to include all and be useful. ”
During most of my eight years as a local representative of the liberists in the parliament, Friday meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, the tone of most meetings and promises for “slowly and moderate ” policies have been forgotten for a long time if they have ever been on the agenda.
It was increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerant in the leaberist party and that every opinion is estimated on the basis of this as much as it likes the leadership of the party.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I used to think that they share similar political views, began expecting me to make a reverse revolution and take positions that I would never agree -- either on national security or the single EU market.
Whenever I make public statements -- no matter what I'm actually saying -- there is a whole insulting tirade in social networks where it calls for revocation, dismissal of moderate policies, statements that they do not belong to the leaberists.
Like that, it doesn't only happen to me.
In the interest of truth, I know that I even got more lucky than some of my colleagues, since the comments for me are at least political.
I can only admire professionalism and the targetingness of these colleagues who face sexist or racist frauds every day without fearing them.
One of the greatest disappointments in this era in politics is how such insults have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that labyrists should hug the culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer widespread, as at any sign of untrustingness or changing the choice rules becomes increasingly closer.
In the last two years, I have received many advice to be quiet, not speaking so much, and then “all will be fine. ”
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Leberists 32 years ago as a student provoked by Thacher's government, which through its ignorance led to literal decline in my excellent school, I fought for better public services for those who need them – either as a local advisor or as minister.
I've never hid my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way from my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state confronts Brekzit, this will harm households, companies and the public sector, and I don't understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Leberists' leader.
But in reality, my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the liberists, or not: It is proud to serve you and I promise that no threats from revocation or political departure will deny me to act in the way that I think is best in the protection of your interests.

Eer 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Air led to classification
The two late esettes may have changed the slight final result, but there is no doubt that Eire deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match from the Tenent League.
The team is already headed by the classification and only of the ten team is without loss until now.
Better protection and better use of opportunities have turned out to be decisive in the game from which Coach Peter Murchie and his team can be very satisfied.
"I'm happy because the other teams tested us quite seriously in the past matches, and we are still without loss," Murchie noted.
Robin Christy from Melrose said: “Gratulations on Earl, they really benefited from their situation better than us. ”
The essence of Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, followed by the successful additional blow of Frazier Climo, led the Ere forward to the result, but the yellow card for the Scot National Rory Hughes, released to play at the Warriers game, allowed Melrose to arrive as a result after Jason Bag realized the esse followed by an unsuccessful supplementary attack.
Climo increased the front for the Air of a punishment stroke shortly before the half-time, noting it after salt action, and then realizing the additional impact, which made the result of 17-5 for the Ere of the vacation.
But Melrose started the second half-time well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful additional hit of Bagot, reduced the front of only five points.
Followed a continuous stop of the game due to a severe injury of Ruarid Not, which was exposed to a bearer, and after the renewal of the Eire match, they increased their advance after Stafford McDowell's essay and the successful supplementary strike on Climo.
Then the Acting Captain of Aer Blair McFerson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of their number of advantages, showing strong pressure and realizing the esej through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional strike.
Nevertheless, the hosts returned their presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow cardoon after slaining the Climo without a ball, the subsequent punishment of McFerson realizes the esse with the help of an advanced offensive line of the Air.
Climo realized the additional strike, not after long after he did it again, after Kyle Row caught the bullet from David Armstrong and pulled Gregor Henry's wing on the fifth ese of the householders.
The Still Game Star seemed to be directed towards a new career in the restaurant business
The star of Still Game Ford Kiernan appears to be directed towards a more sneaky and warm sector after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC transmission, which is also a scriptist and one of the two stars with his long-year comedian partner Greg Hamfield.
Both announced that the forthcoming ninth season would be the last for the transmission, and it seems Kirnan's already planned his life after Craiglang.
According to official registers he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from comment, although the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan intends to engage in the "prosperous restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours," the no way out of the sea of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The seamen are constantly patroling the occinics with a sea headquarters in La Paz.
There's an ocean blue flag above public buildings.
The sea bases from the lake Titicaca to the Amazona are boiled with the motto: “The sea belongs to us right.
It's our duty to bring it back."
In all Bolivia, which does not have access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit transferred to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – and the call to swim again across the Pacific.
In fact, this hope is now the strongest for decades, while Bolivia awaits a conviction from the international court on October 1, after five years of consideration.
"The force is in Bolivia, it feels fashion and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadila said.
Many Bolivians will watch the verdict of the international court on the large screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support the request of Bolivia and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, the harizmatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to go to a controversial battle for reelection in the next year, has also put a lot on the judgment of the court on Monday.
"We are very close to returning access to the Pacific," Moralez promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the probability of making a decision in favour of Bolivia is pretty small, even if it condemns in its favour, it would not change things in reality.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to take the territory of Chile and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgement of the international court is only six months after hearing the last arguments, indicates that the casus is not "complicated", replies Paz Zarate, Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could actually hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean was broken by the current Bolivian government," Zarate claims.
And then he suggested that Morales' military rhetoric had emphasized and the little remained the good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at a time, but it will be extremely difficult after what happened to normal dialogue.
Both countries do not support diplomatic missions to each other since 1962.
Previous President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, representative of Bolivia in Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
He said on Monday, Bolivia will have "a amazing opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relationship with Chile", as well as the chance of "closing 139 years of disagreement by reaching benefits for both parties".
Calzadila also rejected the idea that Morales -- who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America -- used the problem of access to the ocean as “political pattery”.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to enter the Pacific," he added.
"The conviction is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims that it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong Ho said that his country would never approach nuclear disarmament first if he was unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the promises they made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to be on the edge of restarting the unrelevant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Yong Won from North Korea.
Rie called the "empty hope" the idea that continuing with the sanctions and objections of the United States to end the Korean war will make the North fall on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the declaration without Phenjan first to make a significant gesture on the way of disarmament.
And Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second meeting.
But there is a widespread skepticism that in Phenjan they are serious for their rejection of the arsenal that they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenjan next month to arrange the preparation of the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion audits in Paris reveal the last screaming of massive hats that will soon be in fashion shops next to you
If you want to increase your collection from hats or completely block the sunlights, you don't have to look for any more.
Valentino and Tom Brown designers discovered a gamma of incredibly large hats from their incoming SS19 collection, which laughed at the fashion floor during the week of the fashion in Paris.
A lot of irregular hats I caused a wave in Instagram in the summer, sending designers to the eyes of their creatives to make the community of fashion.
Valentino's excellent offer was an extravagant bee hat with a similar feather wide periphery that literally swallowed the heads of the models.
Others were too huge accessories, including jewelry dines, magic hat, and even ananas – but they did not aim to hold warmly on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – in time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had sewed lips and reminded them not as much as for Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs was like a diving accommodation in a full set of snorchels and glasses, while the other looked like a melted ice cream.
If you're facing these fashion trends, you're lucky.
Fashion professionals predict that the huge hats will soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
The huge hats come very soon after the "La Bomba" – the slammed hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on the heads of all – from Ryana to Emily Ratakovski.
The kult to the extremely irregular hat that took over social networks led to another huge design of the fashion podium – a slammed beach bag, large as much as it was wearing with a bath model.
The rafia bag with a color of burned orange, with raphia screwed with white skin handle, was attracting all views of articles in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during the Week of Fashion in Paris.
The stilist of the famous Luke Armitid said before the FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in fashion stores the next summer – after the designer made such an impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for edrogabarit accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain the reputation of academic distinction, which continues in 2018 with another excellent presentation of test results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scotland Association of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As a educational sector that can compose and implement a personal training program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable object in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language that understands it, your words can reach it.
But if you speak his own tongue, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relations and trust with the nations of other countries.
Through the results of this year's tests, we see that languages are first with the highest success for independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have reached the highest assessment of A.
The data collected from 74 members of SCIS schools show that 72% of the students have reached an assessment A in Chinese, with the same estimate 72% of the German students, 69% of French and 63% of the Spanish schools.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland accept foreign languages as vital skills that children and youths will definitely need in the future.
At present, languages as subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural and mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in independent schools and beyond.
The study carried out in 2014 by the United Kingdom's Employment and Employment Commission showed that, for the reasons of which employers were difficult to find employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competences.
As a result, the government of foreign languages becomes increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future career.
More and more jobs require the rule of foreign language, which turns these skills into substantial in a globalized world.
Despite the chosen career, if a person has a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, after he has the same skill that remains for life.
The possibility to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruling few languages one breast in front of the competition.
According to YouGov’s study, more than 4,000 full-year citizens of the United Kingdom in 2013 75% have not owned a foreign language sufficiently to be able to perform the language, and the French was the only language whose rule reaches a two-digit percentage of 15%.
That's why the investment in learning languages today is important to children now.
The rule of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school will differ from the languages in school.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the United Kingdom in the future plan by 2020, for example Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose in independent schools, as teachers will be professionals in their area.
Independent schools in Scotland are firmly determined to provide a educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future hides.
At present, it cannot be denyed that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role in the future of which country is, which requires that this be taken into account in the educational system.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered realisticly as “international communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

Lebron will make his debut on Lakers this week in San Diego.
The waiting is almost over for the fans who're sore to see Lebron James's first match with Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach of Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would take part in the first team's pre-season training against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's gonna play in a fight.
"It will be in the field between one and 48 minutes," the joke Walton announced through the official Lakers website.
The reporter for Lakers Mike Trudelle announced on Tweeter that James would probably play a relatively few minutes in the game.
After training early the week, James was asked about his plans on the sixth match of Lakers' pre-season training.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump meeting in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of elections tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump appointments, which include stops in known places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By delaying the confirmation of its choice to fill a free place in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the forthcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans are threatened by the loss of control of the Congress in November.
What time will Trump's meeting be held in West Virginia tonight, and how can you look online?
The Trump Visit in Willing, West Virginia is planned for 7 a.m., east time tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trump visit in Willing, West Virginia, below by transmitting live on YouTube.
Trump will probably consider this week's hearings on the nominations for the Supreme Court of Justice Bret Cavano, in which there has been tensions for claims of immoral sexual acts, which holds the confirmation of the Senate by a week while the FBI is investigating.
However, the main goal of this series of mythics is to help the Republicans pick up an inertia for the elections in November.
Therefore, the campaign of President Donald Trump announced that these five appointments in the next week aimed at "activating volunteers and supporters, since the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives," says Reuters.
"The control of the Congress is so important for his programme that the president will visit as many states as possible and we start a campaign season full of commitments," the Reuters spokesman of Trump's campaign, who refuses to be mentioned.
The event tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Weeling, may bring the supporters of the Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media from Pitsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, the second visit to Trump for this month in Western Virginia – the state that won with more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Western Virginia Senate, the Republican Patrick Morrisi, who left in the sociological studies.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisi that the president has come to give him a push in the sociological studies," said Simon Heather, politician from the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
"Ryder Cup" 2018: The United States team will fight until the last time, keeping its hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three subsequent sessions without an intrigue "foursom" matches in the week afternoon may have brought what the "Ryder Coup" needed.
The change of advantage in sport is a very subjective concept, however, in which players believe unreservedly, even more in competitions like this.
So, what team is in a better position right now?
"They have led with six points, and now there are only four, so I guess we have a little inertia," Jordan Speed said at the end of today's competitive day.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage at only twelve more.
But as Speed says, the Americans have something else to show, and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge on Speet's sports form and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three of four possible points.
Speed shows an excellent form from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The encouraging voices of the fans were getting stronger, while he had progressed in the round, in which with a precise hit he equipped the result in the fourth match, after Thomas and I left two hits after the first two holes.
His strike, which won the match on the 15th hole, was encountered with strong reactions that make us believe that it's not all lost for the American team.
"It's important that you don't think of anything else and focus on your own match," Speet says.
That's all that's left to these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Speed and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the unsputable heroes of Ryder Cup so far.
The strange but delightful couple of Europe won four out of four, and they seem to be doing everything.
"Mollywood" were the only couple that did not make "boys" on Sunday afternoon, but they also had no "bogita" either on Saturday morning or Friday afternoon or morning.
These consistent successes, as well as the way in which energy passed between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed that they were players who would win Sunday and there will be no better couple than Flitwood and Molinari, which would bring the potential victory of Europe while the sun enters over Le Golf National.
To prefer both of you in different holes at the same time.
However, European glory stories have been a little early.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly handled Sergio Garcia, the hero of the football games since the morning, while he was partnering with Alex Norren.
"Bogs" and two "dbubles" of the first nine holes brought the Spanish and Sweden into problems they failed to deal with.
However, there's no way anyone else can solve your problems in the Sunday matches.
"Fourball" and "foursom" matches are extremely interesting to view closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice that exchange each other, and the way a strategy can endure changes at any moment.
The Europeans played better teams, and so they accumulated a significant advantage before the last day, but this "foursom" session showed that the US team was also ready to fight until the last -- something in which many people, especially in the United States, had a strong doubt.
Europe leads with 10 to 6 on the last day of the Ryder Bath.
Europe will have a solid front before the last day of the Ryder Bath, after leading to the United States with 10 to 6 after the game of football and Foursom games on Saturday.
The inspiring duet Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the unconvincing Tyger Woods, with which their assets in the Le Golf National race increased to four points.
In attempt to restore the trophy that lost Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn dominated the tomorrow's football games over the Americans who were making mistakes, and eventually Europe won a series of 3 to 1 victories.
The United States has proved more resistance in the Foursom games where two wins have won, but they have failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points of the 12th Single game on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first newly recruited in Europe, winning four points in a sequence, and he and Molinari, known as Moliwood, after this senzational weekend, have only become the second couple, winning four points of his first four matches in the history of Ryder's bath.
After Woods and Patrick Reid in the football games without appeal, they were excellently motivated to beat the broken Woods and the US newman Bryson Decambu with even more category results 5&4.
Woods, who barely passed the two matches on Saturday, only showed outbreaks of his genius, but so far he has 19 losses of 29 games in "fourball" and "foursom" matches, as well as a total of seven consequent losses.
Justin Rose, got a vacation for the morning football matches, partnering with Henryk Stanson in the "foursum" conflicts in victory 2&1 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koka – number one and number three in the world.
However, the European team failed to enjoy a completely nice, cold and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
The triple winner Jordan Speed and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They reached a difficult victory with the Spanish John Ram and Ian Polter in the football matches, and later they returned to beat Paulter and Rory Macilroy with 4&3 in "foursom", even though they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Bath, a team was going to get a four-point deficit before the singles, and according to the Regulation, the Furiq team would keep the trophy even at equality.
However, since they were overplayed in two days, their chances of turning on Sunday seemed not very large.
North Korea says that there is no way to disarm unanimously, untrustedly
North Korea's Foreign Minister reported to the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions deepen the lack of confidence in the United States and there is no way the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong-how said that in the last year, "significant measures of goodwill" were taken, for example, we stop nuclear and missile tests, destroy the nuclear test object and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"Although we do not see the relevant response by the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and there is no way we first disarm ourselves unilaterally under no circumstances."
While Ri expressed the known complaints of North Korea on Washington's resistance against the "poathpen" approach to removal of nuclear weapons in which North Korea would be rewarded, since it had taken steps, his statement seemed significant, since he did not reject the unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Phenjan did in the past.
Ri called on a joint statement by Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump on the first summit between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to work for the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", and Trump guaranteed North Korea's security security.
North Korea has aimed at the official end of the Korean war since 1950-1953, but the United States say Phenjan should first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes calls for relief of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists "to remove the nuclear weapons first" and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even object to "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The recognition that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who don't know us.
However, the problem is that continuing sanctions deepen our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention whether it was planned to hold a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed through the UN earlier week ago.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Je-In in the past five months and added: “If the nuclear disarmament country was South Korea, rather than the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would not be such a delay.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different than the previous year, when he told the UN General Meeting that the direction of north Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States was inevitable, after the "los President" Trump called Kim "the man-racket" of a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations Trump, who threatened North Korea with "full destruction" last year, commends Kim for its courage to take disarmament measures, but said that there is still a lot of work to do and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump emphasized that there was no time for this and said: “It doesn't matter if it take two years, three or five months. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Phenjan for the measures taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the execution of the Security Council sanctions must continue indefinitely until full, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in attempting to stop the financing of the nuclear programme and Phenjan's balistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN general meeting coulours and then said he would visit Phenjan again in the next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Phenjan in July, saying that progress was made, but only a few hours later, North Korea accused him of sending "gangster requests".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea has promised to destroy a missile object and a nuclear complex if the United States take "suitable measures".
He said Kim told him that the "suitable measures", which he seeks, were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and wished to achieve normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard course for enough rest
The new course at the Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in trying to overcome the growing culture of learning "all night" with the help of caffeine.
The teacher found that students at university number one in the world often don't even think about the foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaissler, a sleep professor at the Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist in the Brigam Hospital and a woman's hospital, has prepared the course he thinks he's the first in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he talked about the impact of sleeping on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are they telling me that only now, in my last year?"
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep which surprised me," he said to the Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains the most important thing to students about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements and improve the overall well-being.
Paul Barrayra, a psychiatric professor at the Harvard Medical Faculty and Executive Director of Health Services at the University, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The same hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a living room on which students click on cups of coffee, curtains, maratons and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements affect the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the routine of sleeping for sleep.
In another part of the participants, how long-term sleep exemption may increase the risks of infarction, infarction, depression and cancer.
Then the map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects on the health of the choice to smoke," said Professor Kaissler.
The culture of pride from "training all night" still exists, he said and added that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that deprivation of sleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring sufficiently and quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even in order to avoid filling, as the deprivation of the sleep brings the brain into hunger mode, which makes them hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California, who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Kaissler to prepare the course, taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says that his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread him all over the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is that all graduate students will be asked to complete a similar training programme before they join the competitive institution.
Professor Kaissler recommends that students consider whether to set the alarm for bed and wake up and know the harmful effects of the blue light, emitted by electronic screens and light light light, which can disturb the circuit rhythm and lead to problems with sleeping.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Menga broke Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shock broke Steven Gerard's union team and brought a victory with 1-0 to Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to write his first victory as a guest of the triumph in February with 4-1 over St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only defeated Gerard's second defeat in his 18th match as the manager, which left his team with eight points less than the crew of Harts, the leader in the High League of Ladbrokes.
Menga noticed seven minutes before the vacation, and the deprived of the constructive ideas of the Rangers team at no moment seemed close to the alignment.
After the Rangers took off the sixth place, and Livingston's already three, leaving the second Hybernian only on the head of the difference.
For Rangers, there may be additional problems, since Judge Calum Spence got a head wound after hit by a subject that was obviously thrown by guest fans.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that smashed the Air in the half-finals of the Scotland League.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same Livingston eleven, who pulled the point against Harts last week, and should be pleased with the way his aggressive team parsed all the actions of the opponent.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did better in the rare cases when they owned it.
They had to note in the second minute when Menga made a touch against the gateman, Alan McGreger, but the semi-protector missed a good opportunity.
Later, the Kygan Jacobs center of the faul found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense, Alan Litgow, pulled the ball off the back of the wall.
Rangers took control of the game, but they failed to create anything containing in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there was a 15th-minute need to be a collapse when he encountered Steven Lawles, but Steven Thompson's referee rejected the claims of the Colombian.
Rangers only made two exact hits during the first half time, but the former gateway from Ibrox Liam Kelly easily handled the head of Lassana Culibali and the weak shot of these Ejaria.
Although Livi's impact in the 34th minute was surprising with regard to the ownership of the ball, it was fully earned.
Rangers never managed to handle Jacobs' deep center again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly handed over to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the vacation, changing Culibali with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately led to the result when the wing passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out and blocked the blow.
However, Livingstone continued to force guests to play in a convenient for the household style of the game, such as Litgow and Halket constantly slipped the long-length balls forward.
Holt's team could have increased his front in the last minute, but McGregger managed to handle Jacobs' hit, and at the next corner of Litgow fired with a head next to the greeter.
The entrance as a reservation of Glenn Midlton from Rangers asked for a collapse at the end of the fight after Jacobs struggle, but Thompson didn't see anything wrong again in the situation.
Anniversary: Manufacturer of the Geiger Counter
Page of our Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago and Broene... the day the future physicist Johan Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany was born.
Gaiger develops a method of detection and measurement of radioactiveness, invention, which eventually leads to the creation of a device known as a gaiger numberer.
A coangle stone in science since then, the geiger counter became also a cornerstone of pop culture, when in 1950, the film “Coronado Cambanes”, in which seemed to be part of the incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What, for God, is this?
Rogers: This is a gaiger counter and is used to discover radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these listeners on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms separated from radioactivities in minerals."
Evans: “Surely he cares right now! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the discovery that brings his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the lab
Then they can "see" protein that is common for many types of cancer and is injected again in the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancer diseases.
A woman treated with a vaccine that trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells saw her cancer of eggs disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and changing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" protein common for many types of cancer called HER2 and then be injected again in the patient.
According to Professor J. Berzofsky of the National Oncological Institute of the United States in Bethesa, Maryland: “The results suggest we have a very promising vaccine. ”
HER2 “incentives the growth of several types of cancer”, including the breasts, eggs, lungs and colored cancer, explained Professor Berzoffski.
Similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “training” to how to target cancer cells was used for treatment of leukemia.
Kenny West made a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the title “Let us make America big again ” in its participation in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was whistled in the studio during Saturday Night Live after making an immediate implementation, commending the President of the United States Donald Trump and said he would be the president in 2020.
After he performed his third song for the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with a "Let America Make Great again," he declared himself against the democrats and said his support for Trump.
"I talk to whites very often, and they ask me, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL started the show with Matt Damon's participation, in which the Hollywood Star cheated on Brett Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Law Committee for Sexual Violence complaints made by Christine Blazey Ford.
Although it wasn't transmitted, West's performance recording was transferred to social networks from comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to play West with his publication.
Furthermore, West complained in front of the audience that he had problems behind the towers because of his hat.
"I was tortured behind the towers.
They told me, "Don't go out with that hat."
I was stopped!
And then they claim I'm on a drowning ship," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the drowning ship?" claiming that he will wear Superman's suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
The comments caused at least two scouts from the audience and the SNL team seemed ashamed, Variety reported, saying: “The entire studio has shut up.”
West was invited at the last moment to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, McMiller, died a few days ago.
West confused many with the fulfillment of the song “I Love it”, dressed as a bottle “Perie”.
West received support from the TPUSA Conservative Group manager, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the most brave: thank you for being set up with the crowd.”
But the leader of the current show, Karen Hunter, wrote on Twitter that West was just "see himself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (as I buy music or clothing or support his art), whom I think he welcomes and disseminates ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he changed his name, as now "he is officially known as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist who's changing his name, and he follows Deedy's example, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
His friend, the Rapper Snoop Dog, was called Snoop Lion, and the musical legend of Prince changed his name with a symbol.

The star of "Igran a thrones" Keith Harrington is against the toxic manhood
Keith Harrington is famous for the role of the sword waving John Snow in the full of violence a medium-century fantasy series of NGO "The Game of thrones".
But the actor, who was 31, declared against the macho hero stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen leads youths often to think that they must be "surrect" to be respected.
In the interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed that "something was wrong" and asked us how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the age of #MeToo.
Keith, who recently married his partner from Rose Leslie's Game of thrones, also at 31, admits that he feels “surely confident” that this problem should be solved.
"Now I am personally strongly convinced - what have we made wrong about manhood?" he said.
"What do you learn from adolescent men about the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television may partly be responsible for increasing the toxic manhood because of many male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What is taught from television and on the street that makes the boys feel like they should become this particular type of men?
I think this is really one of the big issues of our time - how do we change it?
'Cause obviously something's confused for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the pre-history or continuation of the "Game of thrones" after the end of the summer, claiming that he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
Since November, Keith will be participating in the reconstruction of the True West of Sam Shepherd, the history of the film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently said his wife's acquaintance with Rose was the best thing that happened in the Game of thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so he gave me my future family and set my life forward," he said.
Rose plays Igrit, the girl where the hero of Keith John Snow falls in love with a fantasy series, an Amy's prize holder.
Both married in June 2018 in the name of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a jump with 14% of citizens living with HIV and backs.
According to health services in the country, more than 820 000 people have been affected.
Only during the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been caused by sexual contacts, which notes a change compared to the past.
Traditional HIV is rapidly spread into certain parts of China as a result of transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been taken down almost to zero, stated China's health services at the province of Yunnan.
However, each year, the number of those living with HIV and back in China increases by 100,000.
Transfer of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality has been decriminated in China, but discrimination against people in the KGBT communities is widespread.
According to studies due to the conservative values of 70 to 90% of men who had sexual contacts with men, they eventually marry women.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases are due to incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the government of China has promised to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the expiry of the data of senators from the Republican Party, slandering "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, a member of the United States Chamber of Representatives, Maxin Waters condemned the charges that a member of her team has published personal information to three state senators from the Republicans on the Wikipedia legislators' pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles said the claims were made by experts and sites on the Ultra Right Wing.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement in Twitter.
The published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of the United States Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hutch, who are from Utah.
Information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person by the Capitolia during the hearing of the Senate's composition on the accusations of immoral sexual behaviour against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Bret Kawanau.
The expiry is done after the three senators interrogated Kavanou.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of publications was linked to Waters' office and released information about the member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and is absolute lie," continued Waters.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraud and false claims – is not in any way responsible for the expiry of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and is absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly caused online criticism, including by the former Prime Minister of the White House, Ari Flysher.
“In this denial, there is poison," Flysher wrote.
“This assumes that it does not have the temperament suitable for a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be mad.
It's not supposed to be challenging.
I shouldn't question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and balanced."
Flysher compared Water's response to the criticism by Judge Cavano's democrats, who was accused by the criticists that he also seemed angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republicans for Waters' place in the intermediate elections, also expressed his opinion in Twitter.
“Really, if it is true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had been reviewing the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be disclosed," she continued, "and that they will be under legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for all members of my team."
Review of Johnny English Explodes again – the weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new British film and it appears to be true about the renewal of an exhaust-commediary, spy French for Johnny English – who launched in 2003 with "Johnnie English" and returned in 2011 with "Johnny English returns".
Will self-emusement and mimics that say how obvious it is that we're stupid become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with embedded eyes and a "hume" person has the permission to renew things for the second time – his name is most important when it comes to a great comic art intended for fans of the movies who do not speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent, who despite his strange claims for flattering has a little of Clouseau, a little of Mr. Bean and a large part of the man who contributed with a note about the music theme Chariots of Fire at the ceremony of the discovery of the Olympic games in London in 2012.
Furthermore, it is originally based on leaving chaos after itself a traveler and an international man whom Atkinson plays in already forgotten TV ads on Barclaycard.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there are or two good moments.
I liked that when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medium-century armor, and for a short time the pairs screwed up in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to the physical comedie and apparent, but humor is quite weak and strangely excessive, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "The Mission impossible" include a dosage of comedy.
The humor seems to be directed rather to children than to the adults, but the crazy accidents of Johnny English I think are not innovative and focused because you don't have Actinson's game reminds Mr. Bean.
It's always the current assumption that Britain is faced with serious problems.
Cyberhaker hacked the British super secret network of spys and revealed the identity of all operative agents for the horrors of the departing agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is induced and remembered the figure and has already suffered from a full breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can for this quazi-Tereza-May role, but there is nothing to do with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she should call a retired agent, since all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is currently working as a teacher in a scooky center, who, however, illegally teaches how to be an undercover agent: there are some good impacts here when Englez constructs a spy rock academy.
English was called to Whitehall for an emergency instruction and gathered again with his former long-year assistant Bo played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, a joyful role in which Vicki Pepperdin's talent is scattered.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the major problems of Her Majesty's secret services and face fatal beautiful Ofelia Buletova, played by Olga Kurillenko.
Meanwhile, the Minister of Presidency is under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technological billionaire, who claims that he can solve British computer problems: the horrible Jason Walta, played by Jack Lacey.
Andanglish and Bo start their odyseum from farses: dressed as waiters, burning a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak into Walta's luxury yacht; and English causes a real anarchy when he trys to use a helmet for virtual reality to recognize the interior of Walta's house.
All the smiles are certainly taken from the previous movie, but since as sweet and violent, there's a lot more content here for children.
It's a very medium-sized product.
Just like in other movies about Johnny English, I keep thinking: Can the British film industry not give Atkinson the role that matches his talent?
Leiberists deny that the British plan is designed to work four days a week, but to receive a fee for five.
The Leiberist Party of Jeremy Corbin is considering a radical plan that says that the British should work four weekly but get a pay for five.
The Party claims that he wants the company's bosses to provide economies made through the revolutionary artificial intelligence (II) to workers, giving them another vacation day.
She wants workers to enjoy the three-day weekend but to receive the same payment.
The sources say that the idea would "pass" the economic programme and the party's plans to shake the country for workers.
The transition to a four-day working week is approved by the Congress of the Professional Unions as a way that workers benefit from the changing economy.
A higher source from the Leberist Party said to the Sunday Times: "It is expected before the end of the year to be reported for the revision of the policy.
"It is not going to happen immediately, but the four-day working week is a strike that is incorporated in the economic rebalance approach for workers, as well as in the common industrial strategy of the party."
The Laberist Party will not be the first one that has such an idea. The Green Party has promised a four-day working week during its common pre-electoral campaign in 2017.
However, at the moment this strike does not meet the approval of the entire leather party.
Leberists speaker said: "The four-day working week is not in the party's policy."
The Chancellor in Shadow John McDonalle used the conference of the Leberists last week to reveal his vision of socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonalle said he's determined to take power back from "private directors" and "speculants" in community services companies.
The Chancellor's plans in the shadows also mean that the current owners of shares in water supply companies may not receive their entire share, as the leuberist government could impose “holds” on the basis of established violations.
Furthermore, he confirmed the plans to bring employees into the boards of companies and create privatisation funds for transfer of 10 per cent of net capital to private companies of employees who can accumulate annual dividends to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy speak "60 minutes ago" whether Cavano's investigation by the FBI could change their opinion.
The FBI investigation against Judge Brett Cavano slowed his final nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised the question of whether the findings of the desk could make some of the senators of the Republican party withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 minutes" Scott Pelly asked the Senators of the Republican Party John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could find something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after the event, after the statement came out, and asked him, ‘ Did you do it? ’
He was decisive, categorized and uncertain."
Graham's voice, however, seemed to be compromised.
"I have an opinion on Brett Cavano and to change it, there is a need for shocking charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denyed it категорically," Graham added, turning to Christine Blassey Ford.
"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
It's been 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it at all help to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be a host of the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, which has an impressive composition of performers and performs an impressive mission as well: the removal of poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the large sea in the Central Park, which will not only enjoy the performance of Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but will also meet the real goal of the event – to remove the exceptional poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who fight actively.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (except if you don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" as voluntary participation, sending emails to the world's leader, phone calling or connecting in other ways to help raise awareness about their goal to eliminate poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen 12 years before he achieves his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert a brilliant way to be convinced to require action or is just another case of so-called "clictivism" – people think they do something important when they sign online petition or send post to Twitter?
Since 2011, “Global Citizen” has recorded more than 19 million“actions” from its supporters who insist on a variety of different purposes.
It states that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion, which will affect the life of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and messages resulting from its actions, which have already been paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group believes that the funds already have directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the “Food Force” established in the UK, partnership between investors and performers, engagement with “help children to develop their full potential”, which promises to provide Rwanda 35 million dollars to help end non-food in the country after more than 4700 posts received in Twitter by “global citizens”.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice to non-food simply into a historic note," Ambassador Tracy Ulman said in April 2018 before the audience of a live concert in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken, which call on Britain to improve mothers and children's nutrition, the government has reported on the financing of the project, the Food Force, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of his web sites, "Why do you think we can stop the exceptional poverty?"
"Global Citizen" replied: This will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we fail and we will fail again.
But as with the great movement of civil rights and against the apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Janel Mona are only some of the performers of this year's event in New York, which will lead to Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the military forces to block and prevent the export of energy - the Minister of Interior
Washington may, if necessary, flee to its marine forces to prevent the entry of Russian energy products on the markets, including the Middle East, discovered the US Interior Minister Ryan Zink, as the Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink claims that Russia's engagement in Syria -- more specifically, where it works on the invitation of the legitimate government -- is a pretext to study new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in East and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our military forces, ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that the energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed the presence of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group with a non-proportionate goal, which is represented as the “loss of energy users” in the United States.
He intended to compare Washington's approaches to deal with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, the stimulation and replacement of fuel," he said, at the same time as Russia as "pony with one number", with an economy depending on the digging fuels.
The statements come at a time when Trump's administration has the task of strengthening the export of liquid gas to Europe, replaceing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this purpose, the officials in Trump's administration, including the US President Donald Trump themselves, are trying to convince Germany to retire from the “inappropriate” project for the North Stream 2, which, according to Trump, turns Berlin into a “looking hostage”.
Moscow emphasized several times that the pipeline for 11 billion dollars on the North Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
Kremel claims that the zealous opposition of Washington to the project is directed just for economic reasons and is an example of unloyal competition.
"I believe that we share the perspective, energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative response from Germany, which reaffirmed its engagement with the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the German industry Federation (DBDI) urged the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German industry Federation (BDI, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will look seriously" at the president's candidacy in 2020, said the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "see" the president's candidacy after the intermediate elections.
During the city council in Hollioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was considering to be candidated.
"It's time in Washington to enter women and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"In November 6, I will look seriously at the presidential candidacy."
Warren expressed his judgment on President Donald Trump during the city council, saying he "goes this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was open in its criticism to Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano.
At Twitter post on Friday Warren said "of course we need a FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a sociological study conducted on Thursday showed that most of the voters of Warren themselves do not think that it should be candidated in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be candidated, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent have supported this candidacy.
The sociological study has shown more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the Democratic Party discussed on potential candidation in 2020 include the former Vice-President Joe Bayden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he would make an official decision in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed the PTSP on Track Palin on the Donald Trump event
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the September record.
He was arrested and accused of a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my own son passs through after he returns is known to other families that feel the consequences of the PTSR and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home," she said before the audience of the Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans from the war that "they return a little changed, crowned, returned and wondering if they would receive the respect that they and their brothers gave to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and accused of attack and domestic violence against a woman, included in the report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in an immediate state, according to Dan Bennett, speaker of the Vasila police administration.
18 states and district of Colombia support the controversy of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian district support the judicial contradiction of the new US policy, which denies asylum to victims of gangster and domestic violence.
On Friday, the representatives of the 18th states and the district filed a request for goodwill in Washington in support of the asylum-seekers and contesting the policy, the NBC News reported.
The entire name of the prosecutor in the case "Grace v. Cesions", which the US Union for Civil Freedoms filed against federal policy in August, was not revealed.
She claims that her partner "and the sons of his cruel members" abused her, but US officials rejected the asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The United States lawyers who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum candidates come in the United States, as nations faced comprehensive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US policy in the field of asylum returned the decision of the Appeal Board of Immigrants since 2014, allowing immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply asylum.
The Colombian attorney Carl Rusin said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be examined in accordance with the specific facts and circumstances and that prohibition violate this principle," says the report of goodwill.
Furthermore, lawyers claim in the report that the policy that refuses to enter immigrants is harmful to the American economy, saying it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary labour hand."
In June, the Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sesions ordered judges in immigration cases to stop providing asylum to victims running from domestic abuse and gang violence.
"The asylum is given to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear for race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or political belief," Cesions said in its communication of 11 July on politics.
The asylum never had aimed at relieving all problems -- not all serious -- people face each day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate efforts to save in Palu while deaths are doubled during the search for survivors
The situation for survivors is getting more difficult.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusumma, calming her sick boy in the evacuation center in the desolated town of Palu.
"Each minute, an ambulance wears more bodies.
The pure water is poor."
The inhabitants are noticed to return to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded stuff.
Thousands of people are wounded, and hospitals damaged by the earthquake with a magnet 7.5 are filled.
Some of the injured, including Dvi Harris, who suffered the breaking of the spine and shoulder, was located outside the Army hospital in Palu, where patients are treated openly due to continuing secondary pants.
His eyes are filled with tears when he remembers how he felt the cruel earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed in the ruined wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he came to the city with the family to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "Trust" with "propagand advertising"
One week after the official newspaper in China released a four-page advertising in the American daily for mutual benefits from trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Peking of the use of the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, the US President Donald Trump called on China Daily's paid publication in Des Moines Register – the most selling newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere with the US convention on November 6th.
Trump's accusation that Peki is trying to interfere with the elections for the American Congress, noted what American officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign for pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war in which import tariffs are equipped between the countries.
According to US and China experts at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in the states like Iowa, supporting the Republican Trump Party.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador in China and the former long-year governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a comment in the Sunday number of Des Moines Register, "touches this harassment in the moment by putting advertising advertising into our own free press."
"In the spread of its propaganda, China's government benefits from the respected tradition in America for freedom of speech and press, by launching a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," says Branstad.
"Instead, the newspaper stadium down the street here, in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see the real reflection of the diversity of the views that the Chinese people can have on China's anxious economic trajectory, taking into account that the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish” his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Cavano's aggression, the Republicans disturb voting women for intermediate elections, analysts warn
Since many of the high-level republicans are behind and defend the nominations for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, in respect of several sexual assault charges, the analysts warned that there would be an answerable response, more specifically than women, during the forthcoming interim elections.
The emotions around the barrel are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already noted that they wish to continue voting.
These things cannot be restored," said Grant Raher, a politology professor at Maxwell's university in Syracuse, before the Hill for the article published on Saturday.
Racher said he doubts whether the insistence at the last moment of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national speaker on the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters scanded "November coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate's corridor, since the Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to continue with Cavano's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasse Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," Stew Rotenberg told the news, a non-party political analyst.
"People say the problem is already serious; it is true.
But it may become even more serious, especially among women's voters in the pre-graduate and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years, who often do not vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony described her sexual assault charges against the nominations of the Supreme Court, the analysts suggest that it may follow a response if the Republicans insiste on confirming the candidacy.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Party, at the beginning of the last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Cavano is placed on the chamber. It is about how the Republicans deal with it and how they treat it," Gai Cesil, director of Priorities of the United States, said to the journalist channel, the group that helps select democrats.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided on the question of whom to believe as a result of the testimony of Ford and Cavano, slightly more branching towards the second.
A new YouGov sociological study shows that 41 percent of the respondents are likely to believe Ford's testimony, and 35 percent say that definitely or probably believe Cavano.
Furthermore, 38 percent say that Cavano was likely or surely lying during his testimony, while 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's claim, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least another prosecutor, Debora Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath in front of the Senate's judicial committee that Cavano attacked her in anxious state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court has shown its genitalia before her while they were at the party during her follow-up to Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of World Wide Web Tim Burners-Lee begins the beginning that aims to compete on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company that builds a platform with open code of Burners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company Burners-Lee, it is a joke that the intention behind the Inrupt is “the world domination”.
"We need to do it now," he said about the beginning.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "online storage of personal data" or sub.
It contains lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through each browser, and at the same time all of them at the same time.
The unique in the online storage of personal data is that the user determines who has access to.
The company calls it "authorization of personal data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of the company John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and suitable skills in order to help Solid become available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Burners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several developers, concluded a project work agreement and a group of volunteers programmers.
Since this week, world technology developers can create their decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a full change or not when all their business models are updated completely for one night.
"We do not want them to be authorized."
In a media publication on Saturday, Burners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission was to provide energy for trade and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid basis.
In 1994, Burners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusett Technical Institute.
During the last few months, Burners-Lee has a strong influence in the network's neutrality debate.
Although it starts the Intrupt, Burners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic for this new era on the Internet," Burners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: in the memory of the priest rewarded by Victoria during World War I
It has been observed for 100 years in the hometown of the only English priest who was accorded with the victim Victoria for his involvement in battle during the First World War.
Colonel Reverend Burnard Van won the prize on 29 September 1918 at the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was killed by a sniper without knowing that he was honored with the highest military honours of Britain.
The monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren, on a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that it was "exclusively symbolic" that the monument was discovered for exactly 100 years from his grandfather's case, awarded with a medal.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin “in a very dense fog and under a heavy shooting of artillery and carpets. ”
Later, he attacked the fire line and with the "incredible courage" he led forward before he attacked the gun with one hand and killed three of the crew.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “things I know I could never do, but it makes me humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, set a chain after the parade led by the Brantwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was "a great honour to participate in the parade" and added "the advantage of the real hero is demonstrated by support that will be provided to many people".
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you wait all night to watch the full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can't be witnessed the main event.
The San José programme contained 13 fights, including six of the main map and had to be emitted live in the night in Britain by Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mussassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the observers in Britain remained stunned when the transmission changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed since they were built until early hours, especially because of the fight.
The fan described in Twitter the switching of a child animation film as a "some painful joke".
"The government regulates that this content is not suitable at 6 p.m., so the programme has been changed with child transmission," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of the Bellator marketing and communications, in response to the issue of transmission.
"Peppa pig," yes."
The president of the company Bellator Scott Cocker said they'd work on the planning of meetings to include the observers from Britain in the future.
"I think when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Cocker said.
"There is, however, six a.m. on Sunday and there is no way to plan things so that the event will be held on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't like that, he was government.
I can promise you that next time this won't happen.
We will stick to the inclusion of five fights instead of six – as we do usual. We tried to give ourselves more to the fans, but we have too much.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "niversal" because of his sexuality
The Olympic jumper in the water, Tom Daily, says he grew up, feeling less than everyone else because of his sexuality -- but it motivated him to succeed.
24-year-old athlete claims that until he started to study in high school, he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview for the first release of the Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he talked about the gay rights to give "nade" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in the winning of the Olympic Games.
The Permanent Head of the Long Year Show, Curstie Yang, is in hospital for a few months.
In his first program, Lavern Daley said he felt " less" than all the others while he grew up, since "that was not socially acceptable to like girls and boys."
He said: “To date, the feeling of minority and the fact that I am different from others are things that give me energy and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove it "something," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The biennial olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in the LGBT campaigns and used its participation in this year's British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he did this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and he wanted to inspire “the hope ” of others.
The three-fold world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, he was "with surprise."
Daily married Oscar's owner, who was 20 years older than he last year, but claims that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you go through so much as you are so young," he participated for the first time in the Olympic games of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later," he said, "it's hard to find someone at your age who has experienced similar rises and falls."
They both became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley himself says his "all the peace view" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I was only interested in wining a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was called his father Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said that his father couldn't accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the Olympic games in London in 2012 – because he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "You won't be with me, Dad, nor in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until I stopped breathing and at the moment when I realized he was dead, I finally admitted he was not insecure," he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the Olympiade in 2012 and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I had dreamed about this all my life -- jumping on the Olympic games in front of the audience at home. There was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – "Proud" from Heather Smoll – who was accompanied by him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still made him feel distressed.
Desert Island Discs is transmitted on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday from 11:15 p.m., British summer time.
The lost shape of Michelson remains on the Rider Bath on Saturday
The American Phil Michelson will put a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at the Ryder Bath, but he'll have to return his old shape if he doesn't want his record to be related to failure.
Michelson, participating in a two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on Captain Jim Furick's football chamber on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure again in the United States team, the five-time major tournament winner spent his day as a fan and in training his strikes from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
48-year-old sportsman, who even at the top of his career has never been among the most linear players, is not in a optimum form for the difficult field of Le Golf National, where the long inequality field usually punishes every wrong strike.
And if the playground alone isn't anxious enough, on the ninth match on Sunday, Michelson will face the precise champion of British Open Francesco Molinari, who's in a team with a new brand Tommy Flitwood and is trying to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who leave with four points before the 12th single game, make a strong start, it can turn out that Michelson's match is absolutely decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his companion, although he could hardly say something much different.
"He fully understood his role today, beat my back, hug me, and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
“He is confident in himself.
He's a member of the glory Hall and has given as much as in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing only two games.
I was expecting it to play more, but it just worked out, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be at the golf field and play, just like everyone else."
Michelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the most games in the Ryder Coup played on Sunday.
This could end his career in the Ryder Coup, which never approached his impressive individual accomplishments.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furick said his presence has other benefits for the team that are not measured with figures.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, clever, he likes to joke with people and is a great man for every team," he explained.
"I think younger players were having fun with him, especially this week.
He gives much more than just to play."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great lead can soon be melted.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, from personal experience, knows that the great front of the single games from the last day of the Rider Coup, can be easily removed.
The Danish debuted at the Valderrama game in 1997, when the team with Captain Seve Ballisteros led five points before the Americans, but exactly on the final rights was almost arrived and he barely succeeded in victory with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You continue to remind us that we had a great advantage on "Valderrama"; we also had a great front of "Brookline", where we lost, and "Valderrama" we won, but very difficult," said Bjorn, after the European team in 2018 won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, leading with 10-6 to "Le Golf National:".
So the story has to show both me and everyone in the team that it's not all over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Get out and do what you need to do.
Nothing's over until you see the final results of the board.
We have a goal and it's to try to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to keep focused on.
I kept saying that I only think of 12 players in our team, but we are also aware of our rivals, who are the biggest players in the world."
Being satisfied with the presentation of the players of a difficult golf field, Bjorn added: “I would never hurry with the celebration.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow on the front, individual performances will come out, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you test your entire capacity as a golf player.
This is the message that must reach the players: Tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your partner's back on your back, as he has to split up to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, the captain of the rival Jim Furick will want his players to represent themselves better individually than as partners, with exceptions only Jordan Speet and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four possible points.
The Furrick himself was on both sides of those great reverses last day – he was part of the Brokline triumph, and then on the losing side, when the Europeans committed the "Mudrith of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshau, the captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw at "Brookline", and "Medinah".
When the advantage goes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches play under huge pressure.
So we formed our composition and distributed our boys as we want to try to do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to lead our counter-attack and face Rory Macilroy at the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Polter will meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
"I have chosen these players in this order because I think it gives us the greatest chances of success," Bjorn said for his choice for the singles.
Germany delays the launch of a new battleship
The latest fregagy of the German fleet was to be introduced in 2014 to replace older warships from the time of the Cold War, but this would not be done until the next year because of the incorrect systems and mainly growing costs, local media reported.
The introduction of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leading ship of the mark of new fregats from Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, quoted by the army speaker.
The sailing court was to join the maritime forces in 2014, but the problems that occurred after his delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four ships from Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the old fregates of Bremen class.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful weapon, a set of air and anti-road missiles, as well as some stelth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods – the latest fregats should be able to be used in up to two years before they return to the ports of home.
The continuous delays, however, mean that the adventurous military ships – which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean – will be old when they enter the operation, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 fregage entered the titles last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the vessel in operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship building in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns the ship to the ship builder after delivery.
It is not known about the reasons for return, but German media quoted a number of substantial "software and hardware defects", which make the military ship unused if it is sent to a war mission.
Software deficiencies are particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg vessels of class Baden-Wuerttemberg will be managed by a crew of approximately 120 sailors – only half of the crew of the older fregates of Bremen class.
Furthermore, it turns out that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the possibility of the military forces to add future superstructures.
It is believed that the 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is twice more difficult than ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, also becomes a problem.
It is believed that it has reached the spectacular €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German marine forces are swifting.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, Chief of the German Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet is actually "is exhausted from ships capable of missions".
The official said that the problem has increased in time, since the old ships have been taken out of operation, but they have not been provided new.
He complained that no fregue of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the fleet.
The National Trust tracks the secret life of the stickers
A new study carried out in the Scottish mountains aims to determine how the stickers use the landscape when they hunt.
Hopes are that the discoveries will bring new light on the behavior of unique flying bovines and will help to manage future protection actions.
Study from Scientists from the National Tribe of Scotland will follow the often met stickers, as well as brown arrows water nights in Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed on key places in the property to monitor the activities of the stickers during the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
The expert audio analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the calling sounds of the stickers and which types they issue.
The map of the location and report will then be prepared to create a detailed landscape of their behaviour.
Rob Duar, Nature Protection Adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will disclose which zones from the site are the most important for the stickers and how they are used by any kind.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of the site, such as the creation of leathers, and the best way to maintain forest areas for stickers and other related species.
The popularity of stickers in Scotland and Britain generally decreased significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their asylums and lead to loss of accommodation.
Risk for populations may be from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and certain chemical processing of construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, the stickers aren't blind.
However, because of their habits of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a robbery.
They use an improved echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight trajectory.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes the stickers very seriously.
The threshold has trained experts conducting regular studies, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special reserve for stickers in the Threave property in the area of Dumfris and Galleway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of stickers in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson says it's a perfect territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, we have a great field for the stickers," he noted.
"We have old buildings, many adult trees and a complete suitable place.
But there are more things about the stickers that are not known, so the work we do here and in other property will help us understand better what they need to flow."
It stresses that it is important to verify the existence of stickers before the maintenance activities are carried out, as unwilling destruction of a shelter is possible to kill up to 400 female and young stickers and destroy the entire local population.
The stickers are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, torture, disturb or destroy their asylums.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee in the Trst to protect the sticks, encouraged the society to help.
She said: “I still have a lot to learn about our stickers and many of our species, because we just don’t know what happens with their population. ”
Ronaldo rejects claims for rape and his lawyers will judge German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo identified the claims for rape against him as “fake news, ” saying that people“ want to become famous ” using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German journal Der Spiegel, which published these claims.
The attacker of Portugal and Yuventus was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It's alleged that then he paid her $355,000 to silence the incident, said Der Spiegel on Friday.
In the Instagram video, turning to its 142 million followers, a few hours after the publication of the claims, the 33-year-old Ronaldo slaughtered the publication as “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is a false news," the five-fold Gold Ball carrier said in front of the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to accumulate popularity on my back, but that's part of the work.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," the footballist smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to judge Der Spiegel for the claims that they call "inadmissible publication of suspects in the field of personal life", according to Reuters.
The attorney Christian Sherc said the football player would ask for compensation for "moral damage in size corresponding to the weight of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident occurred in June 2009 in the apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the football room, where he claimed to have raped her analytically, according to the documents submitted in the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her he was a "good boy" of "99 percent," but in the case he just surrendered to "one percent".
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that happened with her consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and photos were made of her injuries at the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement, because she felt "awful of revenge" and was concerned not to be "publicly humiliated".
34-year-old woman says she wishes to cancel the agreement because she continues to live with the injury of the incident.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the edge to join the Real Madrid of Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian grand Yuventus for the amount of 100m euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "will regret forever" for losing car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever" if he loses his status of a world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, the Secretary of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "restraining" that Toyota UK said to BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production in its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the delay of the border in the case of Brexit without a deal could lead to loss of jobs.
In the Burnaston factory – where models of Auris and Avensis are produced – were produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported for the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnastone.
Other producers of cars from Great Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says they will close their factory for the Mini model in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in the cases of Brexit without a deal.
The Toyota's production line works on the principle “auto-time” and parts arrive at every 37 minutes of the suppliers both from Britain and the EU for vehicles manufactured by order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be problems on the border, which, according to the industry, can lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota would be impossible to wait more than one day to fill their inventory in the Darbisher factory, said the company, and that's why the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa Mei's "shahmat plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success but also to be able to grab this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio programme 4's Today.
"After not only Toyota's claims but also other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot tell how long the production will be stopped, but in a longer term, they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Zevalaris, who has worked in Burnastone for 24 years and is the founder of the Union in the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: “I think of my experience that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
The government spokesman said: "We have put a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump with Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "revocated for another week", since the fight of the candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Cavano, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein observes the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian intervention in the elections, the links between the Assistants of Trump and Russia and the potential obstacle to justice by the President.
That whether Trump will fire the Deputy Chief Prosecutor, or not in this way, would endanger Mueller's independence, has been feeding rumours about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record the talks with Trump and the possibility to remove the president by 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "no" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the hearing before the Senate legal committee, for which they witnessed both Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment - Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation by the FBI to complain against Cavano, even more delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's speaker, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday on Fox News.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date may not yet be determined, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it may also be delayed for the next week.
But we will see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House of September 10th.
The leader of the show Chris Wallace asked about the reason.
Sanders replied that rare press conferences were not due to "democratic behaviour" of television journalists, even though he said: "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behaviour."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President has more sessions with questions and answers from each president before him," she said, in addition, without quoting evidence: "We have checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if press representatives have a chance to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, this is far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you are witnesses to practice it quite often over the past weeks, and this will replace press conferences after you have the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States."
The Trump regularly answers questions when it leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with high-level guests.
Self-conference press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his excentric and moments of strange behaviour to the gathered journalists.
Health Minister has contacted EU workers in the Scotland National Health Service on the fears related to Brexit
The Health Minister has writtenly addressed the EU staff working in the Scotland National Health Service to express its appreciation and their wish to remain in place after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scotland parliament, sent a letter to less than six months before the exit of Britain from the EU.
The Scotland government has already engaged with costs for established EU citizens' status procedures working in decentralized public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the talks between Britain and the EU on leaving continued, expecting solutions.
But the British government also progresses in its preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
Therefore, I want to recall how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, no matter his nationality.
Colleagues from all the EU and beyond it contribute to valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which is useful for the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christian Abercromby suffered an emergency surgery after he got a head trauma.
Lienbaker of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercromby, suffered an emergency surgery after he got a head trauma during the Saturday meeting, when his team lost from Vanderbilt Commodores with 31-27, Mike's Tennessee Authority reported.
The Senior Coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reid, told the reporters that the injury happened just before the half-time.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just fell there," Reid said.
Coaches and medical persons have submitted oxygen to Abercrombi on the side line before it is placed on a bearer and carried in the supplementary reviews.
Tennessee State's official confirmed to Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercromby came out of surgery in Vanderbilt Medical Centre.
Harris added that “there are no details on the type/seriousness of the trauma” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercromby, a college scholarship secondary, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blockages before he left the game, which makes 18 blockages for him during this season.

This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
Increasing in the Herb tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
State custody expects an increase of over 120 million British pounds a year, which will help the homeless
Teresa May will announce today the decision by foreign buyers to pay a higher warrant in buying real estate in Britain, while additional revenues will go to help the homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, promised more available housings and directed to people with high income.
The increase in the herb tax will affect physical persons and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, while additional revenues will help the Government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is a supplement to the current herb tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second housing and property purchased for dedication – may be up to three per cent.
State custody expects the proceedings to increase by up to 120 million British pounds a year.
About 13 percent of the new buildings in London are purchased by citizens outside Britain, leading to the increase in prices and making it difficult for those who buy property for the first time to intervene in the real estate market.
Many of the rich areas, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new policy appears only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the warranty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high prices of property by robbing the land, but not using it, and asked Mrs. May to leave the quotas for available housings in order to fix the "happiness with the housing" of Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced an attractive series of offers for housing reforms, including control of rent and end of the exile "no guilty".
He also wishes to provide councils with greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. Mae said: "Last year I shared that I would like to devote my time as the prime minister to restore the British dream -- the life of every new generation to be better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be with open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right that people who do not live in Britain and foreign companies buy as easy as workers in Britain.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has gone too far in time, and the distress from sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: “My goal is to run the Scotland team. ”
Sunderland's manager Jack Ross said "the biggest ambition" in his career was to be the senior coach of the Scotland National Team.
The 42-year-old Scotch accepted the challenge to restore the Northeast England club, which is currently at the third position in the First League, at three points from the first place.
He passed to the Stedium of the Light this summer after the last season took St. Mirren back to the Scotland High League.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a game for the B team and that was all," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up with the Scotland games of Hampden, which we looked together with my father as a child, so the national team always attracted me.
"This possibility, however, would only be opened if I had a success at the club level."
Among Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's managers are names such as Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Alderdays, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Poirot and Paolo De Kanio.
Aloa Atletic's former teacher said he didn't feel anxious as heir of such firm names in a famous club like before he rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"To me, the success will now be measured with a positive answer to the question: Can I bring this club back to the High League?"
Because on the structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It will not be easy to return to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can bring the team back there."
Ross is only a manager for three years after he spent some time as a assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' coach headquarters.
Then he helped Aloa not fall into the Third Division and turned St. Mirren out of the falling team to win the Championship in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than his career at Clyde, Hartlipool, Folkerk, Saint Miren and Hamilton Academycle.
"I was really on the cross," he remembered the time he took Aloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the best thing for me, including before I was an active player.
It sounds strange because I was doing good, making good money, and I had some significant success.
But being a player is sometimes hard.
There's a lot of things you need to deal with every week.
I'm still faced with the same level of stress and tension in work, but I just feel that being the manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be the manager and now that I really do it, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin throughout my conscious life."

The ideal beer time is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals research
Summer heat increases the income of fighters to survive British pubs, but has accumulated more tension for the chains of restaurants.
The pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the revenues in the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, the statistics indicated.
Peter Martin, a business-consultant CGA, who composed statistics, said: “With the long suntime and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Championship, in July a similar model was followed as June, when the pubs reported to increase by 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants received even stronger strike.
The drop of 1.8% in the restaurant business in June just deepened in July.
The pigs and drink bars have reported the best results in their growth compared to the lowering movement of restaurants.
Food pabs also suffered from the suntime, but not as many restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In the pubs and bars, drink sales jumped by 6.6 per cent per month, while there is a 3 per cent reduction in food."
Paul Newman, analyst of rest and entertainment, shared: “These results continue the trend we noticed at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when dealing with sales in the outside house service sector.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although the decline in sales with 4.8% of the annual base may be particularly painful in addition to permanent costs.
The long hot summer could not appear at a worse time for food managers and only time will show whether the moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the desired rest."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly discovered, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the delay in the opening of the marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker, analyst of sales in the pab sector, bars and restaurants in Great Britain, collects and analyses data on the implementation of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover over 9 billion British pounds, and is a strong indicator in the industry.
One of five children hides a secret profile from their parents in a social network
One of five children — some only 11 — has a secret profile in a social network that hides from their parents and teachers, revealed a study
Study conducted among 20,000 students from high schools shows the growth of false Insta pages
News raised fears of publication of materials with sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "based" profile that they showed to their parents
One of the five children — some in 11 — creates a social network profile that keeps secret from adults.
Study among 20,000 students from high schools shows growth in false Insta accounts – reference to the website for sharing pictures of Instagram.
The news raised the fears that materials with sexual content were published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clear "based" profile that they showed to their parents, while they also had secret profiles.
A mother who encountered a secret site on her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager child, which encouraged others to rape him.
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools revealed that 40% of children between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, and half of them recognize that they keep their profiles in secret.
The HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: “It is anxious that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Alyd Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland
Alyd Doyle was elected to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as director without executive functions of the annual general meeting of the governing authority.
Doyle was the Scotland's minor athlete with the most achievements and President Ian Beatty identified this move as a great opportunity for those who lead in sport, to benefit from its rich experience at the international level in the last decade.
"Aylid is excited with great respect in the lightly-athletic communities of Scotland, Great Britain and the world, and we are convinced that the light athletic in Scotland will benefit from its attraction," Beatty said.
Doyle said: “I have a desire to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can really contribute to the promotion of sports in Scotland. ”
The American, who won the finals of 200 and 400 meters of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, added to its four Olympic gold medals, and currently is a regular commentator in BBC, lost his ability to walk after he got a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I got a hit a month ago.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will show if I'm going to recover and to what extent.
It was an exhausting work, but I have achieved a full recovery, I learned to go again, and I am doing movement training today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for a breast pump comparing mothers with cows shared online opinions
The company that produces feed pumps shared online opinions with the advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are breast-feeding.
In order to note the marketing of the expected “first silent breeding pump in the world suitable for carrying”, the Elvie consumer technology company released a jokeful musical video advertisement to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides for breeding.
Four real mothers dance in cowboys, full of shadow, on the background of a song with text, which includes: "Yes, I breast, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not a vime, it's my chest."
The song continues: “Pump, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, feed your girlfriends. ”
However, the advertisement published on Facebook's company page caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the observers, and many claim that it reduces the "strains" of the milk processing industry.
“It is a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and born to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie feed pump is collected discreetly in a breast suit (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is fully understandable that it is traumatic both for the mother and for the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast-feeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another one added: “So inadequate advertising. ”
Others protected the advertising, when one woman admitted that the song was considered "extremely fun".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
I felt just like a cow.
The advertisement is a little rat, but I accept it as it is.
This product is brilliant," someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a ridiculous advertisement directed to mothers who are sitting (often at their jobs or toilets) and feel like “cows. ”
This is not an advertising, praising or condemning the milk processing industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they were dancing with discreet pumps placed in their substitutes.
The concept of the campaign is based on the vision that many women who are breastfeeding feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pomp is completely silent, no wire or tubes and gathers discreetly in a suit for breastfeeding, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even to go out while they crush.
Anne Balarin, partner and Executive Creative Director in Mother, commented: “The Elvie Pomp is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative marketing.
By drawing a parallel between the breasts and the cows, we wanted to focus attention to breeding and all the challenges associated with this, while showing a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that brings the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie pump falls into leading news.
During the Sunday of Fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the designer stage, Martha Jakubovski, using the product.
Thousands of migrants have been secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of immigrants detained children rapidly fell, although the monthly crossing of the border remains relatively unchanged, partly because the acute rhetoric and policy by the Trump administration has made the accommodation of children with guardians difficult.
Most guardians are usually immigrants without documents who fear to risk their stay in the country if they want to recognize the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults of the family should provide fingerprints, and those data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a high-level employee in the Immigration and Customs Service, testifies before the Congress that the Agency arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of uncommunicated minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no previous criminal records.
“Nearly 80 percent of the persons who are either guardians or are members of the family of the guardians are illegally staying in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these persons," Albens said.
In an effort to deal faster with the registration of these children, the authorities have imposed new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within the month of their detention, not after 60 days, as the previous standard, according to the shelter officials.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not in person to present their case for a legal status before an immigration judge.
Those which are defined as inappropriate to accept will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely to become depressed or depressed, which can lead to violent explosions or escape attempts, according to staff in the shelter and reports that have come out of the system over the past months.
Attorneys shared that this concern increased in large facilities, such as this in Tornilo, where the signs that a child has problems are likely to be ignored because of the scale of the place.
They added that displacement of children into the “free city ” without giving them enough time to prepare at an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends may make many of them more difficult to fight with.
Syria urges US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
With reference to the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although civil war has been on eight years.
Mualem, who also takes the duty of Deputy Minister-President, said that foreign troops are illicitly staying on the Syrian country under the pretext of combating terrorism and "to them the relevant actions will be taken".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Mualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost at its end ” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been violently moved from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy battle until all Syrian lands are cleaned" both by terrorist organizations and from "every illegal presence of aliens".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrians, President Basar al-Asad opposition.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the lands of the lands of the lands of war.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that the conditions are tolerable and can be returned, accusing "some Western countries of the "disciplination of unreasonable fears", which incite refugees to stand away.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to cooperate with these returns," he said.
"They're turning into a political matter something that's a whole humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for Syria's recovery until the political agreement between Assad and the war resistance is reached.
UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large fortress of the rebels in Idlib offers an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a widespread attack by the Russian Syrian forces over the province where three million people live.
Muallem, however, stressed that the agreement had "jassy deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed towards dżihadists, including fighters from Al-Kaida Front Al Nusra, which "will be destroyed".
The UN Ambassador Stafan de Mistura hopes soon to summon the first meetings of the new committee, composed by the Government and the opposition, to establish a draft consecutive constitution of Syria and make way to elections.
Mualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "review of members of the current constitution" and warned that there should not be any interference.
Why Trump will win the second mandate
This logic is that Trump will win the re-election of the elections in 2020, unless -- as many Liberal viewers are likely to hope – his presidentship will not be terminated in advance because of impishmant and scandal.
This would no doubt be the "the most dramatic end of presidency ever!"
There are no signs of the fatigue of the audience.
Since 2014, the rating of the Primetime has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News have a average of 2.4 million viewers during the Priimtime, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nelsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC is at the top of cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million audiences at big news evenings.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neil Bayer, an executive producer of the ABC drama "Last candidate", where it is told about the secretary of the office, who becomes president after the attack against Capitolia.
Nell Skovl, who is a veteran-scenarist of comedies and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking In the Hollywood Boys’ Club”, has another theory.
She remembers the taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her she'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
Mrs. Scowell told me he answered her "Why he's laughing at me."
There's a mess in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that is shown on TV, the stories coming from Washington can define the future of Row v. Wade, whether families of immigrants can gather again, as well as the good state of the world economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the privileged viewers can afford.
Nevertheless, the desire to be a informed citizen does not correspond to this at six hours to see how a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Strah"; the pilot jacket of Paul Manafort of the strauss skin for $15,000 ("the drowning of arrogance" according to "Washington Post") and the exciting descriptions of Stormmy Daniels on Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I specially will never look at Super Mario again the same way.
"The part of what he does to make you feel like a part of a reality show is to give you a little bit every night," said Brent Montgomery, the chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creationer of the "Pawn Stars", about the exchangers and daily calls (abuting with the National Football League, praising Kim Cheng Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be out.
When I contacted Mr. Flyce this week, he was at the northern coast of Kawai, 80 degrees, but he was closed at home to watch MSNBC, while recording CNN.
It was not possible to separate it from the TV, especially when Brett Cavano had to face the Senate's legal committee, and it depended on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we used to make all those cheerful broadcasts and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flyce told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be right."

Investments are influencing in the most disputed race in pre-congress elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money, thanks to the remodelation of the Congress Countries and from there two titlers for the same place.
The recently distributed district in Pittsburgh's suburbs indicates the conservative democrat Connor Lamb, who won his place from another district of partial elections last spring.
Lamb faces another title, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is substantially represented with the new 17th.
The maps were reimbursed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district has broken up a financial dispute between the major funding institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb was read in Pennsylvania after the difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Congress County of Pennsylvania.
The position was borrowed by the Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the circle with 20 points.
Political experts believe that democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considers imposed sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, and then withdraws
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a little pressure by Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heart meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team from the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the State Department decided to revoke the leaders of the diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, because of "the recent decisions to not recognise Taiwan," Heather Nauert, speaker of the Department earlier this month.
However, sanctions were envisaged only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received some 140 million US$ aid from America for the fight against drugs, with a view to development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including the cutting of financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would be tormentable for the Central America State with its unemployment and the percentage of murders.
With progress in internal meetings, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which serves to continue such a gathering last year, considered as a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
By mid-September, however, the high governance authorities stated that their wish was to hold the conference, thus effectively ceasing any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice-President Mike Pens announced that he would participate in the conference planned in the middle of October as a sign of the importance that the administration has given to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strict communications or sanctions from Washington.
The speaker of the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the debate details described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, wanted to remain anonymous who agreed to participate in internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Study History
The next move may be the report of Special Adviser Robert Muller on possible obstacles to justice by Mr Trump, and the report is now significant evidence in the public register.
It is claimed that Mr. Muller is directing his investigation and to whether Mr. Trump has conspired with Russia during his campaign at their attack against our elections.
If the Congress's leadership is changed, it will turn out that Mr Trump will have to report to this body, just when he is ready to face the voters and perhaps to the jury members of his colleagues.
There are many unknown here, and I do not imply that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable - nor that of the likes of him in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, have to make these choices that will affect the prolongation of the fight.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to commit a state revolt against Hitler, until the West rebelled and supported the Czechoslovaci in München.
We failed, and we missed the possibility of avoiding the next years of the slaughter.
The course of history depends on such hollow moments, and the unauthorized march of democracy hastens or slows.
Right now, the Americans are faced with several similar hollows of the moment.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to sign the president secretly and speculate that he was not suitable for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein announced that the Times history was incorrect.
"How will we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavano, requested by the FBI, is not full or fair - or if it is approved for the Supreme Court despite the accusations of sexual persecution and false witnessing?
And mostly, would we vote at the preliminary elections for the Congress, if it would force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is waiting for her for a long winter.
But I believe we're not going to fail because I took a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that ever occupied my messenger's home.
She survived, immigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light the candles for Sabbath on that table wearing a swastick.
With an inheritance like this, how can I not be optimist for our future?"

Graham Dorance from Rangers is a optimist for the struggle with Rapid Vienna
Rangers are hosts of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month will give them a considerable chance to move forward by the G League of Europe.
Injury in the knee did not allow a semi-protector Graham Dorants to play his first match for the season before the question equality 2-2 with Villareal, but he believes that for Rangers this result could turn into a tramplin to greater achievements.
"We have won an important point because Willareal are a good opponent," said 31-year-old football player.
"We went into a game with hope that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but as a whole equality seems to be a fair result.
They were better in the first half-time, and we were in the second.
We looked at Thursday, another big night of our games in Europe.
I hope we can fight for the three points, this will be a difficult match because they have achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I'm sure with our support of our audience, we can do everything we can and achieve a good result.
Last year, it was definitely difficult after everything that happened next to my injuries and changes in the club, but now things seem to go in the rules of direction.
The team is good, and the boys really have fun, training is useful.
I hope we will be able to intensify our powers to forget the past season and achieve the desired success."
Women worry about fears about their pension savings
Despite the fact that participants in the study had a clear idea of what care they want to receive, few people discussed this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study share that they discussed with their husbands the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent have talked to their children about this.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Nationwide life insurance sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife/i and your children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not announce your desires in advance.
Together with your advisor and your family, discuss where and how you want to get anxiety, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in the determination of costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you with the idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions, when you choose a financial institution for long-term care, may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with a monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your funds – if you have monetary resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Cope with the legal battles at the beginning.
Appoint a healthcare authority so that you have a certain trustee to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Consider also the idea of a financial authority.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unavailable.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents need an emergency medical care and travel to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Show these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not only about the financial aspect, but also what the doctors will be," Martin said.
"What are the meds?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make a plan."

The police describe the shooting that happened around 2:30 a British summer time, as a "a random act".
The victim hasn't been able to see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a powerful earthquake and tsunami who hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, expecting the number of dead to grow.
Because of the interrupted communications, the aid organisations cannot receive information from the Dongala regent, a region northern from Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the Sulavezi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province central Sulavezi, located at the end of the close beach edge on the west coast of Sulavezi, with the population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami shook him.
Dongala is a regent, which extends more than 300 km (180 miles) on the coast edge of the Sulavezi island.
The regency, which is less than a province, is with approximately 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the province's central Sulavezi economy, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
The nikel gain is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morvali, on the opposite coast of Sulavezi.
Palu and Dongala have been summoned several times by tsunami over the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Recovery Agency after disasters.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami struck the west part of Dongala and in 1996, when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic “Pacific fire ring” and is regularly underwhelmed by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunami waves in the past years:
2004: A strong shock on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province Aceh in North Sumatra activated a tsunami wave that shook 14 countries and destroyed 226 000 people across the coast of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of them are in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias near Sumatra's coast.
2006: The Rabbit with Magnitudide 6,8 killed the most inhabited island in Indonesia, Java, by activating tsunami, which broke down in the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Magnitudine earthquake 7,6 hits near Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra Province.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: Magnitude earthquake 7,5 slaughtered one of the Mentawai islands and activated a 10-meter tsunami wave, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Plute earthquake hit the regent Pidi Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, since people remembered the devastation of the death earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, tsunami is not activated, but more than 100 people were killed by ruined buildings.
2018: Tourist island Lombok in Indonesia, more than 500 people died, most of whom were from the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily out.
Sarah Paylin's biggest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Paylin, the greatest son of the former Governor of Alaska and a candidate for Vice-President Sarah Paylin, was arrested in charge of violence.
Peylin, 29, was arrested for domestic violence suspects, interference with domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to the State police report in Alaska, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female gentleman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Paylin was detained in the preliminary detention building Mat-Su and under an unsafe guarantee of $500, reported by KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, surely", when he was asked for a pledging, the media reported.
Paylin is threatened by a penalty for three offences from class A, which means that he may be deprived of freedom for a year and pay a penalty of $250,000.
He is also accused of a crime of class B, which is punished by a day in prison and a $2000 fine.
This isn't the first time there are punishment charges against Palene.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently considered by the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, intervention in reporting crime for domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of influential substances in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend claims he hit her with a handcuff in the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 when she connected her son's aggressive behavior with post-traumatic stress resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died of a earthquake, which slained the Indoneian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
The magnitude earthquake 7.5 caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication network is broken, expecting the number of dead to grow in the nearby days.
The earthquake hit near the central Sulavezi, north-east of the capital of Indonesia – Jacarda.
In social networks, videos are rotating that show the moment of the collision.
Thousands of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu, when the tsunami wave shore.
Federal Prosecutors want a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist assassination in New York.
The federal prosecutors in New York want a death penalty for Saifoulo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist assassination in New York, in which eight people have died – a rarely encountered punishment that has not been executed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
It is claimed that Sayipov, at 30 years of age, used a truck rented by Home Depot to commit the assassination in October of the veloaley near the West Side highway in lower Manhattan, walking walkers and bicycles on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused severe body injuries, in accordance with the intent on the request for a death penalty filed in the Southern region, New York.
According to the judicial document, both charges may be completed with a death sentence.
Weeks after the assassination, an extensive federal judicial body sent a 22-point prosecution to Saipov, including eight murder charges related to a rocket used by the federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and the destruction of the IPSC.
The attack required "great planning and intention," the prosecutors said, describeing the way Sayipov was performed as "awful, cruel and perverted".
"Sifulo Habibulejevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses of the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lory Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlee, Ernan Feluci and Alejandro Damian Panuco," said the notification.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South York area has been looking for death punishment.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was accused of the murder of two drugs, but was subsequently sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time in New York, the death sentence was executed in the federal case was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after the conspiracy sentence and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed on the electric chair on June 1953.
Saipov, Uzbekistan, has not shown a feeling of regret over the days and months after the assassination, according to the judicial documents.
He said to the investigators that he felt good from what he did, says the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he inspired the attack after watching the IDIL videos on his phone, the prosecution act claims.
He also asked his hospital room to set the IDIL flag, they shared the police.
He pleads innocent on the prosecution act consisting of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "approximately disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We think the decision to seek a death sentence instead of accepting a sentence for guilty and lifetime prison without an opportunity for early release will only extend the traumatic effect of these events for all affected," Patton said.
The Sayipov Protection Team before that, he wanted the prosecutor's office not to ask for a death sentence.
Member of the Parliament of Conservators says that NAJGUL FARRAGH should run the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraż said to "mobilize the army of the people" today, during the protest at the Conservatorial Conference.
Former head of the British Independence Party said that politicians should "conscious pressure" -- as one of the members of Teresa May's own party, he proposed that he run the EU negotiations.
Peter Bon, a Conservatorial Deputy, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "will have come out so far", if Mr. Faraz was a secretary for Braxit.
But the challenge that Mrs. Mae faces to agree with the deeply divided lines of the party was underlined by conservators supporting the remaining which joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain its compromise plan Chequers, despite the attacks of the supporters of Brekzit, supporting remaining from the EU.
Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite the hostile reactions and insist on European skeptics and layberists to choose between her package and the chaos.
Mr. Bon said to the protesters with the "Exit means exit" in Solichel that he wished to "free Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr. Faraz had to participate equally with the others and that he had to receive responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was head, we would have left by now," he said.
The Deputy of Wellingbrow added: “I support Brexit, but we have to drop the Chequers plan.”
Proclaiming our opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be robotable.
We want to create our laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected the claim that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The concept that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain is completely false."
The conservator's representative, Andrea Jenkins, also participates in the event, shared before the reporters: "I'm just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the broad public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually came out and really helped us be elected.
Please leave "Chequers" and start listening."
In the open message to Ms. Mae, she added: “The prime ministers keep their position when they follow their promises. ”
Mr. Faraž said to the auspices that politicians should "sensite pressure" if they plan to change the decision taken after the referendum in 2016.
"It is now about trusts between us - people - and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to change Braxit and we have gathered here today to say "We will not let you get away with this."
In turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the edge to change Braxit, feel pressure.
"We mobilize the army of the people of this country that helped us defeat Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-controlling, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supporters of the stay went through Birmingham before conducting a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
A pack of activists raised flags with labels “Conservators against Brexit” after the group was launched this weekend.
The laiberist Lord Adonis played with the conservators on the security problems of the party when it was discovered at the conference.
"They are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all of Canada's technology and more, and yet, for the free crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a full farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Warren said he would "consume" his presidential candidacy
The state Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that he would "consider seriously the possibility to become president" after the November elections.
Boston Global reported that the representative of the Democrats of Massachusetts spoke about her future during the city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent criticist of President Donald Trump, will be candidated for a reelection in November against the state representative of the Republicans, Jeff Dill, who was jointly chairman of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.

The event on Saturday afternoon in Hollioke was her 36th meeting with voters in the building of the city after the Trump entry into office.
One of the attendants asked her if she plans to become president.
Warren answered that it was time for “wives to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, and that includes women on top”.
He was arrested for the death of Simms from LSU.
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was an arrested suspect in the shooting on Friday when basketballist Wade Simms was killed.
The Baton Rouge Police Office reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 a.m. e.
They published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man who was seen on the footage.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head, which eventually leads to his death," said Murphy J. Paul's chief before the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was at the crime scene, he had a gun and shot Wade Simms.

Gran Pri to Russia: Louis Hamilton is increasingly closer to the world title, after his team's instructions helped defeat Sebastian Fetel
Since Walter Botas was classified before Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team would have an important role in the competition.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two bands, giving Fetel the opportunity to attack his companion.
Fetel first made a pit-stop and let Hamilton deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial for the exit of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit-stop on the next round and went after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to be ahead of him after a brave maneuver and driving a rubber to a tire, which forced Ferrari's pilot with unwanted desire to release the inside of the road to avoid the punishment with an added time after he had already closed his opponent's road with a dangerous double defensive maneuver of the third turn.
Top his 21st birthday Max Verstapen launched from the back line of the starting bar and was seventh after the end of the first round.
Then he even led a very long time of the race, since he decided to change his tires later than the rest, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly in front of Kimmy Raiconen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered for a pit-stop in the 44th circle, but he failed to get enough in the next eight circles and eventually Riconen finished fourth.
It was a tough day, since Walters did a great job all weekend and showed up like a gentleman when he let me go ahead.
The team has done an exceptional job to win the first two seats on the stage," Hamilton said.
It was really a bad body language.
President Donald Trump cheated on senator Diane Finstein on Saturday for her claim that she has not spread the letter from Christine Blazey Ford, which accuses the pretendent of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano of sexual harassment.
During the west Virginia chat, the president did not directly mention the statements given by Ford before the Senate Legal Commission, and instead commented on how what happened in the Senate shows that people are "wretched and disgusting and dishonest".
"What can also happen, what happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting and unhonest," he said.
"When you look at the publications and the spread, and they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Finstein, are you spreading?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document - "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spread."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we weren't spreading," he added, imitating the senator.
Finstein sent a letter with details about Ford's claims against Cavano in July, and it was spread earlier in September – but Finnstein denies that the spread had occurred from her office.
"I didn't cover Ford's claims, I didn't spread her story," Finstein said to the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep confidentiality, and I kept confidentiality as she wished."
But her denial was not well accepted by the president who commented during the Saturday night's rail: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing defending the pretendent for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president pointed out that democrats were using claims for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power with all possible means.
Look at the dishonestness, the embarrassment, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they have to cross in order to restore their power and control," the President said in Mediaite.

The flight manager died to make sure hundreds of people on the plane can escape from earthquake
The head of flights in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, guaranteeing that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board has managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people died and many are unknown in a powerful earthquake that hit the Sulavezi island on Friday, acting by the tsunami wave.
The strong secondary shakes continued to defeat the area and many were caught in a trap in the ruins of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a strongly shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Juffrey airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the track at that time, will be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he had crashed.
He died in the hospital later.
The Speaker of Air Control, Indonesia, Johannes Syrit, said that this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Ballicpapan in Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital to another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the country's reaction agency announced that access to the towns of Dongala, Siggy and Buttong is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will rise, since many bodies are still under the fragments, and many people cannot reach," the spokesman of the Agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said.
The waves that reached six meters desolate Palu, where there was mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying assistance and supplies.
Riza Kusumma, 35-year-old mother, shared before Sky News: “Each minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
There are maroders everywhere in the minimarkets."
Ian Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, pointed out to CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is trying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy now, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Joco Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and turned to the country's army: "I beg you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was slaughtered by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reported that a person is unknown after a plane crash in the laguna
The aircraft that flyed with a plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon now reports that a person was declared disappeared after he said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the drowning plane.
In the press, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon they could not contact a male passor.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the requests for more details for the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
The ships of local people helped save passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water while trying to land at the island of Chuk.
On Friday, the authorities reported that seven people were accepted at the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all stable.
The reason for the disaster and the precise sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the airlines and the US military forces stated that the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the flight.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had passed the road.
The American Bill Janes, a passenger in the plane, claims that the plane went very low.
"This is extremely nice," says Janes.
Janes says that he and the rest of them have managed to go through the deep to the cross of the water to get to the emergency exits of the drowning plane.
He shared that the stewardesses fell into panic and screamed, and that he suffered a mild head trauma.
The U.S. military forces tell us that seamen who repair the port nearby also helped in the rescue action, using a boat to lead people to the shore before the plane drowns in the deepest 30 meters of water (100 feet).
The data from the Safe Aircraft Network indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in flights registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
The analyser exposes the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded with his exhibition on the case this Saturday in the re-trial process against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
The analyst Paul Rowlet from the U.S. Ministry of Justice witnesses for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to compose the movements of 29-year-old Queenton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received data on the location of several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers in the night of her death, back to his previous claims, reported the Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sandford, the police went to question Sandford.
Sanford was standing before the court on Saturday and testifying that he was out of town on that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck the same night, Sanford said that "that's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconvenience is that Telis said she knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
Mobile phone records suggest they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett pointed out that shortly after Chambers Teleis died, he deleted the text messages, calls and information about contact from his phone.
"He removed her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is planned to start with its final leads on Sunday.
The judge said it was expecting the process to be presented to the jury subsequently the same day.

Another black man?
New York Nanny judges a couple, after release for a "racist" message
The New York Nanny judges a couple for dismissal because of discrimination after having received a wrong message from the mother complaining that she is the "next black man".
The couple denies being racist, comparing the desire of extortion.
Lyncy Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was amazed when she realized that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was a black man when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"Noeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,in the text of Ms. Plasco-Flaxman's message to her husband.
Instead of sending him to her husband, however, she sent him to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the former Afro-American nanny, who was an Afro-American, did not work well, and she was expecting a Philippine, reports New York Post.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for a working day afterwards sent home with a taxi.
Now Morris judges the par for compensation due to the dismissal, asking the amount of $350 a day for the six-month contract for which she was originally hired, even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you should not do that," she said to Post on Friday, adding "I'm sure this is discrimination."
In response to the request, the couple claims that they are not racists, adding that the termination of Morris' employment was a reasonable action, since they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after she was offended.
“Woman sent me something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," Post's husband Joel Plasco said.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you offended, even if it was wrong?
You're a newborn?
Think about it."
Beautiful to “extortion, ” Plasco claims that his wife had only two months ago and was in “very difficult situation. ”
"Would you attack someone in this state?
This is not very sweet," added the investment banker.
While the trial is still in the process of review, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks, disrespecting them for their behaviour and their logic.
Paddington’s publishers were afraid that readers would not feel a relationship with a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, born soon after the book was accepted by the audience, tells about the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
Now it's very fun, since we're aware of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC, before inspired to write the child's book about a little bear-toy, would feel optimistic to reject the book, adding that she welcomed the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings" after his death last year.
With regard to Paddington, whom she described as “the important member of our family, ” she added that her father was secretly proud of the final success.
"He was a very modest man and was not self-approval," she said.
"But since Paddington felt so real, it's like having a child that has achieved something: you're proud of it, even though it's not your business.
I think you've somehow accepted Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always described the credits of Paddington himself."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was driven to Louis Pasteur 2 in Nica, where doctors fought for nothing to save her life.
"Nad constantly called to say that the situation is really bad that he does not expect to survive," Mrs. Eden-Laperus told.
"Then Nad called me to say she will die in two minutes and I must say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I told her, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be there soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicinal products given her by doctors to maintain her heart slowly stop acting and leaving her system.
She's gone for a while before that, and that's how it's over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get tight."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who is still grieving about the loss of her daughter, rides on the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the trial she's passing through.
“No one has understood,” she says.
"I was putting my head down, and all the time my tears dropped.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this all-absorbing feeling of compatibility with Над.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
Unfortunate women put cards to prevent suicide from a bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones for suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18 years old.
“I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day, ” she says.
Mrs. Davis, she's 45 years old from Lydney, says her son was a promised cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by smile.
They always said that his smile shines every room."
However, he quit his work before he left, and he was in “true dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly concerned that this will have some consequences. ”
Mrs. Davis creates cards, “to know people that there is someone to go and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Do not keep silence; you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-year-old girlfriend of Mrs. Davis, was losing Mark, her companion in her life for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not share that he felt depressed or depressed or anything else," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He came to the bottom of Christmas, when the children opened their gifts, he neither looked at them, nor did anything."
She shared that this was a terrible injury for them, but they had to deal with: “This opens a vault in the family.
It's breaking us apart.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Cavano is questioned after the FBI starts the investigation.
I was wondering if we could really achieve what he wants -- an inquiry with limited length and limited range -- maybe we could join our efforts," Mr. Flake said on Saturday and added that he fears that the committee is "depleting" despite the consolidated over-party blocking.
Why did Mr. Cavanaugh and his republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their adverseness is for the moment.
The preliminary elections are only five weeks later, on 6 November – if the Republicans are expected not to be well represented, their attempts to be elected in the highest court of the state will seriously affect their attempts to be elected.
George W. Bush calls the senators, inviting them to support Mr. Cavano, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House and with his help, he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where members are now 51 Republicans and 49 democrats.
It's still not clear whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate that will allow Vice-President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea "descends" in Kim
South Korea's legislation claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Cheng Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, quoting data from the United Nations Ministry of South Korea, said that last year there were 1127 refugees, comparing them with 2706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, stricter border control between North Korea and China and the higher amounts requested by human smugglers are key factors.
There is no official comment from Phenjan.
Most of the northern refugees eventually receive citizenship in South Korea.
Seul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed illegally the border from the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and passs easier than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), which divides both Koreas.
China considers refugees illegal migrants, not refugees, often forced to repatriate them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically in war, have improved significantly over the past months.
Earlier this month, the heads of the two countries met in Phenjan for talks focused on the delay in nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they agreed generally to work for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, the Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Yong Ho accused the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be sure of our national security and there is no way for us to be first unilaterally disarmad," Mr. Ri said in speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavano "hysterical" and said he was not suitable for service in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the Congress, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Cavano " hysterical" and said he was too unbalanced to serve in the Supreme Court .
Pelosi commented on this during the interview this Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I had no way to think that if a woman had responded this way, she would be called "hysterical," Pelosi said to her response to Cavano's testimony before the Senate's legal committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected the claim that he committed sexual harassment over Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introduction word, Cavano was very emotional, at times he almost screamed and felt sympathy when he discussed his family and his student age.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the claims against him "grotesk and coordinated attack against the person", organized by Liberals, which are unsatisfied that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi pointed out that Cavano's testimony suggested that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court, since it became clear that he was predominant to the democrats.
"I think he's discvalibrated himself with these claims and by the way he's following the Clinton family and the democrats," she said.
Pelosi denyed when she was asked whether she would try to discredit Cavano, if he was appointed and in case democrats received a majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
"I'll say it like that -- if he doesn't tell the truth before the Congress or the FBI, then he is ugly not only to enter the Supreme Court but also to the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is now a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she is concerned about the potential decisions of Cavano regarding the Law of Accessible Health care or the case Row v. Wade, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Cavano avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, predominant man to enter the court and expect us to say, "Isn't it wonderful," Pelossi finished.
And women have to control themselves.
It's a substantial criticism, after months and years of dissemination of anger, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs Stainham told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, and you?"
She continued, “I received a huge help from a woman who was an executive director somewhere who shared that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she was angry and crying, she said to her companion, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was brilliant."
The tears are allowed in expression of anger, partly because they are wrong at the beginning.
One of my most clear memories of the previous work, in the office mostly with men, is how once when I slipped out of an unexpressive rage, the older woman caught me for a neck - a freezing leader, which I was always a little afraid - and she dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that they did it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his president's campaign at that time.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extra-marriage boat called "Monkey Business" and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, she decided that there was no reason why she should not consider the idea of candidating for the president herself.
"It was not a good solution," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was another one.
Someone called the situation Snow and the seven dwarfs.
Since it's incorporated late in the campaign, it leaves the collection of funds and decides that it will not remain in the race if it fails to gather two million US dollars.
The battle is pre-failed.
She understands that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give her $ 250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
During his speech, which states that it will not continue with the official campaign, it is filled with so many feelings – thanks to the people who supported it, dissatisfaction against the system that is so difficult to gather money and you can turn to the voters and not to the delegates, and the anger against sexism that it felt.
"A man may think I've got a nervous breakthrough," Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted.
"Someone may think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my graveboard?
"She's crying?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can serve Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the United States and China were deaf and, while the battle is just getting speed, one break between the two countries will benefit Beijing in a long-term plan, say experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warranty of this year, putting taxes on key elements of China's export, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest tension escalation appeared this week with new customs, which affects the production of 200 billion US dollars (150 billion British pounds) with an effective tax rate of half of all the goods imported in China.
Every time Beijing returned with new bribes with five to ten percent of US goods for $60 billion.
China has been dedicated to reverse every hit of the United States and soon the second largest world economy is not expected to ignore it.
Force Washington to give up means to surrender to the requests, but bringing a head publicly to Washington will be too embarrassing for C. Jinpin, the president of China.
And yet, according to experts, if Beijing plays his cards properly, the pressure from the U.S. trade war can help in a long-term plan of China to reduce mutual dependence on both economies.
"The fact that a rushed political solution both in Washington and Beijing could create economic crisis conditions in one of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers have recognized before," said Abigail Grace, a scientist on issues related to Asia to the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, said Foreign Minister
Syria announced that she was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asked for assistance in the recovery of the country desolated by the war, for more than seven years.
In turn to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem pointed out that the conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation today is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas desolated by terrorists to restore them to their normal state.
There are now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the state that they were forced to leave for terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily and nutrition.
UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome any aid in the recovery of the devastated country.
However, he emphasized that parole aid or assistance will not be accepted from the countries financed by the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Bath in Paris
Europe's team won "Ryder Cup" for 2018, conquering the US team with a final score 16,5 per 10.5 of "Le Golf National" in Paris, France.
Thus, the United States has six consecutive losses in the European country and has not won the Rider Coup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the championship crown to the tournament after the team led by Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed the victory over the United States.
The star of the United States, Phil Michelson, who presented himself weakly through the majority of the tournament, stopped his first blow on the 16th hole (with the "par" 3) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was greatly presented in all rounds, became one of the four players in the history of the tournament that reached the balance of 5-0-0 since the race was held in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Speed lost категорically with 5&4 of the European team player who is at the lowest place in the rank – Torborn Olesen of Denmark.
The leader of the world rank, Dustin Johnson, lost with 2 and 1 of Ian Poulter from England, for whom this is probably the last part of the Rider Cup.
The Spanish Serhio Garcia, a veteran with eight shares in the Rider Coup, has become a European with the most victory points in the tournament for all times, and this year increases his assets to 25.5 points.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't resist today.
It was a tough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believeing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bowl again.
The team is most important in everything, and I am happy that I have managed to help," said the excited Garcia after the winning of Europe.
He's transmitting his colleague John Ram, who beats the American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 of the singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tyger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four matches in France, and his total balance of Ryder Coup is already 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the biggest players in all times, he won 14 large titles – the indicator that only turns away to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team experienced difficulties throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed a high-class golf all the days of the tournament.
The U.S. captain Jim Furic told after the disappointing presentation of the team: “I am proud of these boys, they fought.
One time this morning, we pressed the Europe team.
There was a fight.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players showed up very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the Association of Professional Golfers of the United States and our "Ryder Cup" committee, and we will only look forward.
I love those 12 boys and I'm proud of being their captain.
You can't take off your opponent's hat.
We were just overplayed."
New for the redflow: Concentrations are reduced in Pinelas, Manoti and Sarasota
The latest report of the Committee on Fish and Wild Animals in Florida shows a principle of reducing the concentrations of redflows in the areas of Tampa Bey.
According to the Committee, there are reports on conditions for the breakdown of growth in the areas of Pinelas, Manothi, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this shows decrease in concentrations.
Water sites with overflow of the red fluid are spreading approximately 130 miles across the coast, from the northern Pinelas district to the southern district of Lee.
The aquaculture particles can be seen 10 miles from the shore of the Hillsboro County, but less than last week.
The Red Flower is also observed in Pasco County.
During the past week, there are data on moderate concentrations in the coastal zone or smaller in the district of Pinelas, low to high concentrations on the coast of Hillsboroe, high concentrations in the district of Manoti, predominations for high concentrations in the coast area or in the area of Sarasota, predictions for moderate concentrations in the area of Charlotte, high concentrations in the coast or in the area of Lee, as well as low concentrations in the area of Collier.
Continue to receive information about the inflammation of the respiratory roads in the districts of Pinelas, Manothy, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
In the past week, there were no reports on the inflammation of respiratory roads in Northwest Florida.
