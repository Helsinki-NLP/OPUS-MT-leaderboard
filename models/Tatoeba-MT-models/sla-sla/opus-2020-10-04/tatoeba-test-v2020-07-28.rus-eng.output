I can't explain that to you.
He's scared of dogs.
There were girls full at the party.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
How did you make an impression on Tom?
Why does he hate me?
Stop irritating him.
He's known her since high school.
Tom pretended nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident almost cost him a lifetime.
He set up a bottle.
We're already home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I disagreed.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you won't understand me.
Why are you so mysterious?
You're just running away from life problems.
Outside the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed my exam.
Eat while it's hot.
So we had to wait three hours.
What are you suggesting?
Tom thinks Maria's an idiot.
I told Tom to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you'd come either.
Last week, I ran into Boston on Tom.
Tom's beauty.

I told Toma that you're busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
Do you want the anecdote?
I wanted to do more.

Are you sure you know what Tom needs to do?
I can't just ignore him.
She's going to school on a bike.
I'll pay for it now!
Do you want to drive?

I'm not trying to convince you.
I knew Tom wouldn't lose.
Tom told Mary that she wanted to drink.
What are you smiling about?

Didn't I tell you I'm allergic to nuts?
I know how old you are.
I won't show it to anyone else.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't want to upset Tom.

I don't have anything to give you.
Why should Tom apologize?
The results were shocking.
It's empty in this room.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe that?
We stayed under the open sky.
Don't lock the door.
When are you free?
Wasn't Tom supposed to do that on October 20th?
I have to go to work right now.
Who's this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does he start?
The smell is one of the five feelings.
What do you have?
They're afraid of him.
Tom's at work.

I got cold from him.
I like Brazil, but I still go to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
I see Tom almost every day after school.

I won't do that again, I promise.
Every morning I go to shopping.
The baby's pushing.
Tom refused to sign the document.
Tom didn't even delay.

What's your favorite movie?
So we didn't have to ask me twice.
You need to go to Boston.
I jumped out of joy.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?

I hope I can help you.
Do your parents know about that?
The waitress put a white scattert on the table.
That day I stayed home because it was raining.
There's a pharmacy around here?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why does Tom look at me like that?
I called the police and told me my car was stolen.
We can discuss this later.
That's a little helping.
The cats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.

But I don't have any money.
How do you feel about Mary's new dress?
His face was scared.
If you don't tell her, I'll tell her.
Can you trust a secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom told everyone he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Take her somewhere.
I was right there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Smell that.
Tom's waking up from a deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?

We have heard these promises before.
What did you and Tom do after dinner?
I'm very unsatisfactory.
As often happens, Mike was late for a meeting this afternoon.

I didn't give it to Tom.
There's strange rumors.
I know you're rich.

I wouldn't be surprised.
Seriously, I'm not lying.

None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I'm not going to screw up.
He got in the car and left.
Tell Tom about everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared with me his soup.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.

You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies the last one.

Fadel went to school.
I've worked with Tom before.
Tom and I are team partners.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more every time I see her.
I think I'm the one?
Everyone but Tom has his hats.
She gives him everything he asks.
Is that selling?
I'm getting worse.
Do you have more than that?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
This only aggravates the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of bathing in the toilet.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're already gone.
Can I take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's some sugar in the bag.

Something very good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't get involved in other people's business.
Who's in the blue shirt?
Tom has an American accent.
I don't have money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
The carrot is useful to see.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I would have written her a letter.
She kept herself for marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.

I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to go upstairs.
His house behind the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
How many lunches!
Mary, are you right now?
I fixed the mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 pumps.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave Tome a shock, she threw a glass of wine through him and took a firm step out of the restaurant, a dead silence was reigned.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We recognized them.
Tom will paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a loan.
Tom's father in prison never writes Tom.
It's expensive.
I haven't received any news from him for hundreds of years.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought we all had a long time to meet.
Everyone's interested in Japan.
Tom's very easy to get out of his mind.
Please, just do everything like me.
Stay there.
I disagree with him.
That's what it's called luck.
It was so dark in the room that I had to sneak through.

Is she your teacher?
Sing again, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom realizes he doesn't need him anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in winter.
I own French.
If that sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom was supposed to tell Mary.
Why are everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so weird.

Tell Mary I got her keys.
Did you buy candles?

Where are the other prisoners?
So many things happened today.
I saw the car beat a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom was working with Mary.
I'm tired.
Do you know what your kids do right now?

Red better.
The universe is infinite.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?

My apartment was robbed last week.
How can you always be so energy?
Put your signature here.
What a ego!
So you bought it?
A man as many years as he feels, and a woman, how much she looks.

There's nothing more to say about him.
What other choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Go home early, Bill.
She was sitting in the chair and reading the magazine.
From now on, it is forbidden to cry.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
That's where he lived.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to the monkey.
Eat my chocolate?
Beautiful in the white, the house seems more.
I've had difficulty finding the original quote.
I had no idea you knew her.
What's the point of doing that?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give Tom more time.
You didn't tell me what Tom speaks French.
Tom's coming back to Boston next week.
Why aren't you helping me?
I watched a French movie with English subtitles.
I'll have lunch.

It's not my cat.
Captain ordered his people to shoot.
Sit there.
He hasn't done that yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom's engaged with my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, thinking like a man, acting like a lady, looking like a girl and working like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I couldn't.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in my hat.
Put him on the shelf.
I thought you found someone else.
On this road, there is always a huge number of vehicles.
You lied to us all.
I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
It doesn't make sense to pretend that you're making me believe that I believe in what you don't believe!
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was pardoned.
I appreciate your support.
You think that's possible?
He's sick to finish everything.
You think Tom's locked up?
If that's true, she's better than me.

The law is on my side.
So I had to find out where to live.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was addressed to the Professor's birthday.
Your phone called a few times while you were in the shower.
She married him for money.
Not any bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just superstition.
Tom must make his own decisions.
The account, please.
Your shoes should always be clean.
You're about to have your birthday.
Count it.
I don't like those shoes.
Tom was married to Mary for a long time.
It's just the picture I've been jumping on the Internet.
I think that's why it's less than thirty.
Did you drink?
It is certainly the best of all to do this.
You're making it easier for me.
Tom said he saw Mary doing this.
Tom can't just leave.
I'm loved.
You don't seem to be very busy.
Deadline's gone.
You're a lot like me.
Do you know those men?
Tom walked out of the room without telling anyone a word.
That probably didn't happen.
Have you finished lunch yet?
Tom and Mary spoke at least an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He tried to save her.
If you press this button, the door will be opened.
How many ties do you need?

Tell me more about them.
Did you hear the last rumors?
I'd show you how it's done.
I begged Tom to come.
You've got a bar.
My mom taught me not to waste money.
We could walk.
She died yesterday afternoon.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took a seat for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I screamed for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know that's important to you.
They all knew her.
We'd better stop.
I'm not late anymore.
I'm so hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom's taking care of horses.
Why doesn't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
People usually die if they're killed.
They unlocked Tom from the lifecare.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Sorry about my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other everything.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom's two you're younger.
Tom closed his cover.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is the heat that can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.

The twelve - hour trip exhausted me.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I'm tired.

He came back two days later.
Tom had breakfast.
We should be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are engaged.
Food!
Did you help Tomu wash the windows?
It's outside my competence.
It was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
Who does your son want to be when he grows up?
I'm out of here.
Don't tell Tomu what really happened.
I'm not just gonna give you this.
What do you say?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Get down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these cards.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I dropped the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read that book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this photograph?

What do you want to hear from me?
Please open the door.

Tom told me what the baby's name was.
Tom thinks I'm in Boston right now.
Tom didn't want to buy a new car.
We're teachers.
Tom will find you.
Everyone has weaknesses.
I hope you're paid well.
Tom didn't eat meat at all.
This book seemed interesting to me.
Thousands of unemployed sleep there day and night.
I guess I'll be late.
Your kids know French?
Tom screamed and ran out of the room.
This soup gives it fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
Didn't you know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They tried to win time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among people, spoke in a horrible way, from the view of the Jews, the Galilean dialect of the aramean language instead of the Hebrew, thus showed the insolvency of claims of the existence of a sacred language, which is particularly closer to God in prayers.
After all, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
That's why they paid $300 for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
Weather forecast was not wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to make you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in the shower.
You remind me of a young man.
Tom's on duty tonight.
I'm always busy.
I'm playing a little piano.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom climbed up quickly.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in my room.
Rest is important.
Have you called Lucy yet?
A good idea came to her at the last moment.

It's very difficult.
You betrayed me.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tom seems to be very busy.
And I'm very happy to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help Tom.
Is that my book?
It's a routine job.
Who else's on your list?
Don't give me my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I knew what to say to them.
Tom's kids must have missed him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He reads physics in Oxford.
He was hiding that fact from me.
You saved me?
He cried loudly in his dream.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom knew Mary by the voice.
You don't even look at me.
Tom's too lazy to do it.
Please stop fighting.

Why won't you be here tomorrow?
We need to know each other better.
Someone said something, but I didn't understand.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital alone.
I sat next to Tom.
Your voice is upset.
You've always been so selfish?
I think this medication will make you very useful.
Tell Toma to be here by half-third.
It's not a god of news of science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it'll be raining.
Would you like a beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was at the threshold of hungry death.
I've learned so much about my mistakes that I think I'm going to do a few more!
My favorite color is blue.
I've made some repairs.

Tom's in the kitchen, mine the bowl.
Temperature dropped by three degrees.

Tom won't ask me to do this.
I want to be like him.
I'll never tell you.
The bus was overloaded.
Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I'm having a cheese.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car is good selling.
I have to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words embarrassed me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom had to do.
Say hello to her.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer is shaken.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I've got to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
The world is cruel.
I have a sensitive dream.
That's why it doesn't matter to anyone but yourself.
I'm from Sidzuoki.
Tom dried all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday is the day he's free.
I wonder what happened to her.
The last bus leaves in 30 minutes.
He told me he'd do it.
He gave him a book.
Thank you very much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
I get it.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm happy with what I am.
Why are you just here?
It's a charm.
I want to know if Tom and Mary are eating meat.
Tom wouldn't listen to my advice.

You don't want another son?
How can I drop the weight?
I think we should report that we're going to be late.
Where are our friends?
Don't forget us.

That's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom kind of said Mary from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very insightful.
There are obstacles in our lives, some call them problems, others speak about opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him to fishing.
You won't have this problem.
I prefer to spend time with friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog floating in the woods.
He told me he wanted to leave the company.
Want to come in?
You and I both know that's not gonna happen.
I thought you knew them.
Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back late.
We need action, not words.

What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It looks like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I shouldn't have let her go.
Tom died a year ago.

If I had money, I'd have bought a computer.
Is Tom smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom's at school right now, isn't it?
Let us know, please.
Tom chewed and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Are you hurting anywhere?
He couldn't leave because of the lack of money.
Let me explain how this works.
Open the door or we'll break it!

I think that's why you can trust.
A lot of mystery in life.
Isn't it too salt?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's a rotten apple.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom's favorite city.
I'm sorry when someone dies.
Are you feeling better?
What makes you think this might interest us?

Thinking of her coming alone, bothered me.
The river flows widely.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I watched them.
Do you really love her?
He gave the facts without comments.
He was dark green.

Do you have a message?
Last night, Tom called me suddenly.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.

I have a job for Tom.
"How was the accident?" - "No one knows."
What do you like in it?
When I came to the station, I called my friend.
I need a ticket for a plane to Moscow.

He's sitting down until late night.
Tom's room is very small.
You speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
This song is condemned to succeed.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we could.
I'm proud of him.
I just got home.
Tom burns both the tree and the coal in his cave.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We must be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom threw Mary's keys.
I've been talking to him all the time.
I can't just laugh at her jokes.
By means of the prophet Zechariah, God foretold the compatibility in Jesus Christ of the king’s power and priesthood.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Everyone of us went home.
It's thin, but it's hard.
It's all a little stupid.
At this point, I don't know what I want.
That's incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six-five for televisioners!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.

That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My table's old.
We're both very busy.
Darkness is untransparent.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll get you.
Tom tried to drown in the bath.
Tom and I are the same growth.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Mary’s younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
The book is big.
Don't talk about Tom like that.
I kind of made it clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Time can change, but human nature is the same.
Tom looks very upset.
I brought a cookie.
Next year, Tom will teach French.
I listened to her until the end.
I advised Tom to rest.
Why does that make you angry?
The worst part of the trip is over.
We'll miss both of you.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase in the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in his shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do that!
That knife was very useful.
How do you know what I had?
It'll take you just a minute.
I would like to change this situation.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very thick.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to trust any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a protein in a wheel.
He didn't get through it.
Would you like to come with us?
Does Tom know how to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We plan to leave as soon as possible.
He went to Hokkaido's ski skies.
"Shut up your fucking music and read the book."
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did it without you.
Your nose's bleeding.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
You will soon be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same thing you do.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the supermarket around here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't know Mary.
I don't think I like that.
Even if you fake, join.
Tom wanted to ask Mary for his pardon again.
Tom was thinking about it.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He's never been.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
It's never been like that before.
I wasn't going to do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Let's go fast, or you'll be late to school.
Did you ever write a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary changed their seats.
How do they take you?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful person, but it's hard to imagine what I'm able to do when my family is threatened.
Mary sewed Alice's new dress.
This decision was difficult to take.
I thought you'd like to drink.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
So you didn't have to leave.
Mary's been fine after the illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
Meat eating hurts your health and the environment.
Are you telling me you don't know anything about it?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
I want you to say a word for me.
No one loves me.
I wish I didn't know Tom's phone.
"Thom knows." "Yes, did you tell him?" "No, he knew it."
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you just thought about something.

Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.

I don't have this book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?

You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut myself with a shaving.
Tom and Mary seem more than just friends.
The river screwed up now.
A strong wind was quiet at night.
The ants and the žiraffs are a long family.

I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom was wearing two suitcases.
Tom, I don't think he recognized me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to bed early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.

The teacher wrote a brief comment on each letter.
It's hard for you to take seriously.
The members of the tribe were settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When's the beginning?
Nobody cares about what she thinks.
I don't think that's weird at all.
"Where did you get my phone?" - "Tom gave it."
When will you clean up the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do this.
Does it make sense?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said he was trying to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at 8 a.m.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You don't know how to write programs.
Change the subject.
I like traveling around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's small, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Please find it, Tom.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is clearly written.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
You don't understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
Do you think you're fat?

Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is infinite!
This box weighs a tonne.
He gets everything because he's a gallop.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he never met her.
It seemed like he was going to kiss me.
Don't sneak on me.
Are you having fun?
I don't think so.
I'll order it later.
Didn't you know Tom was going to Boston?
It's our school.
I've been free yesterday, and I work today.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If I think, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose your patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a horrible man!
The paper's harder.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your powers.
The curse was destroyed.
Grandfather Tom was born blind.
Tom's above you, isn't he?

I'm going with you to Boston.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer, they went to the mountain residence.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary aren't afraid.
Can you get closer?
She's a little shy.
What kind of action do you expect from Tom?
She seemed totally calm.
Press the button.
Tom went out with Mary at the museum.
Tom was intrigued by what happened.
Mary wore boots to her knee.
It's a lie.
I'll keep an eye on them.
She said she was cold.
The road inspector was extremely rude.
Tom wants to follow his father's footsteps.
I don't see a problem here.
I don't have to do that tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's awfully bitter.

Everybody's different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Place a tree over there.

Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How do you feel about my story?
Tom turned off the wakeup and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you sing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?

He says he doesn't plan to go.
I have two dogs, three cats and six chickens.
Does Tom have a cable?
Whatever you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank him for your help.
Tom could have told me.
This will bring an unfortunate joy to your family.
I was very nervous.
Tom said I should go.
I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You should try not to sleep.
My mom's very helpful.
Tom's got a serpent tattoo on his back.
Did you buy meat in a supermarket?
He hit me on a mistake.
What's this dog's name?
Go on the sideway.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's father.
It's raining like a brown.
The whole country is talking about it.
I can't wait to tell him.
You can't buy luck.

I saw Tom take your keys.
The whole night was ruined by the fights of Tom and Mary.
Can you read it?
We need more farmers.
Tell us more about your journey.
Six degrees below zero.
I don't expect you to believe that.
We have seen a lot of unusual plants in the botanic garden.
Sometimes a small gift can be a great love.
Do you prefer blonde or brunette?
I didn't go to the bus.
That's why I didn't like this movie.
You want us to help you?
Be realistic.
Tom was planning on having a party.
I'll call someone for help.
Why didn't you tell us about it before?
Is that Chinese or Japanese?
Fire.
I'm making progress.
You're pale as a ghost.
I'll be home at six.
French is not that complicated.
Let's get out of the cab.
He was seated.
Tom never missed school.
I suggest you do this today.
I'm not going to marry her.
Tom's drinking apple juice.
Are you going on a train?
That's what we think.
How could something like this happen?
You're actress.
Tom was mentally sick.
I forgot to ask.
My hands and legs always frozen.
How can I translate the words that are not available in any language except mine?
Could you tie this with a tape?
I'm going home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.
We're stuck in traffic.
Tom's very angry with me.
I washed my head just once a week.
Eleven is a simple number.
I won't lie to you.
Coffee for me.
We're husband and wife.
Jacksons invited us to dinner tonight.
Tom was impartial.
In October, the leaves begin to fall.
Melanie said she liked swimming.
What was sad about you?
Now I'm too busy to talk to you.
The captain runs his ship and the team.
Tom says he wants to be buried here.
Where'd you go?
Third of the prisoners escaped.
Thank God!
Do you think Tom knows?
This time I'm crying.
Tom was acting like a child.
Stop singing.
There were only six people at the party.
What did you decide?
I didn't know you were romantic.
I saw you spy on Tom.
I need you to do it right now.
The robber came into the house through that door.
I know how to survive.
Mary worked most of her life.
The guy Mary's name is Tom.
I'm afraid I have something to confess.
Tom was expected to be there yesterday.
Tom was an important person.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign it.
You'll be safe there.
I'm in Teheran.
"Do you speak Greek?" "No, it's my first lesson!"
Why did you give him the money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
Did you go to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their desires.
How did you convince her?
I've been to Saporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We will do our best.
Would you buy this?
Tom's gonna be late for the plane.
She's always getting up early.
You want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the depth of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When will we have a woman?
He came here hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is near our school.
That's the cookie I burned for you.
England is like Japan in many ways.
Tom would never do that.
I suggest you try harder.
The lay of this dog doesn't even frighten the baby.
Don't resist.
Tom has keys.
When I'm in a bad mood, I like to think about the moods to get cheerful.
How would you feel if someone did that to you?
We both really want to sleep.
Tom just can't do anything he wants.
Tom doesn't frequently tell us the anecdotes.
The port can be used in many meals.
There's almost no snow here.
I asked Tom to help us.
The lightning hit the tree.
Are you speaking English?
My brother will kill me.
I've opened the cliff.
Tom can stay with me.
Is it difficult to learn Greek?
Will Tom come with you?
Where's the remote control?
I can't find her either.
You'll speak Swedish.
Have you seen anyone else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't put the phone on.
Tell Toma not to see him.
We looked out the window, but we didn't see anything.
You want to work with them?
It was an interesting movie.
I work from morning to evening.
When are we leaving?
It's a fake.
Tom's very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What's going on with Tom?
I hope you won't get cold.
He targeted the bird.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Oh, come on!
I have to go on.
She's squeezing her nose to the glass.
In English, the Ser and Estar verbs are not different.
I know exactly what to do.
He's very secret.
You have an excellent English.
Any messages for me?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing texts by driving the car is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wouldn't win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many lunches do you have?
The black villa was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Foma to stop?
You swore to love me.
I don't want Tom to think he's supposed to talk to me.
I was very calm.
Everyone's got something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice still sounds in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time's all curing.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss the case.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some birds didn't fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you?
I told Toma you came to Australia.
Did you look for this?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where am I supposed to be waiting for you?
I was really worried about you.
What have you found?
Can you explain that to me?
We were caught by a snowstorm.
The book is on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What do we lose?
You better ask him first.
He was fired against wishes.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his pipe?
She never answered his letter.
I hired someone to work today.
Stop screwing the fool!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm on the stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've already done it.
What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me $300.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You won't introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know I'll always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I told Toma that Mary had to do this.
You both are idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How long have you been doing this?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's manager.
Who are you planning to go to Australia?
Someone was yelling.
What's better?
We're grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't say Toma to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train's on 30.
I know you're hiding something.
Free the beast from the cell.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like your father.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please look at this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran away.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't fall in love with your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're much higher than Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on his birth.
Mary says she needs more time.
Foma's pulled off the door.
My dad's an English teacher.
On Christmas, Tom and Mary gave their grandson a bike.
Hold on to the woods.
Did you do that?
I'd like you to translate it to French.
How many glasses on the table?
The lawyer has convincing evidence that she is innocent.
Possibly.
I don't like Tom anymore.
With whom Tom?
Taro has a strong sense of responsibility.
We both saw him.
We're obliged to help.
Tom's been out of jail recently.
Did you tell Tom?
Me!
Tell me what you saw.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know how Tom looks.
I've developed a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only the philosophy can use a vicious circle in proof and receive a high assessment.
I can't afford to have children.
When I talked to them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, so they couldn't get them to understand their own language.
Should I go?
I was so stupid that I believed it.
She really did it.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
My mother must be mad.
White bread, please.
Sows are nice.
Tom's illegitimate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We're perfectly fit.
It's French complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
Danger has passed.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was irritated.
Let me know if you need any help.
We need to get there before him.
He must have missed her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris is far away?
How much time in Tokyo now?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frieda Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim won't be here tonight.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take off your shoes?
We went to the beach.
Do you think it's gonna be a Christmas snow this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you when you pay me as well.
I'd like a coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth completely lately.
You're the only one who likes Tom here.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have another chance.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All the accounts have to pay me.
She's flattered.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom's bringing Mary for his hair.
Tom didn't seem happy to me.
When I grow up, I want to be a fireman.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he liked it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the lazyest one I know.
Mary's already cleaned up in her room?
I'll forgive him this time.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's sober.
Alvaro from Venezuela.
That's the account.
He insulted me publicly.
Tom won't win anymore.
Why don't I stay with you?
Induction tiles for direct heating are used by magnets.
I'm crying.
Tom wants to learn how to play the tromboon.
Get out now.
Can I look at your rights?
I'll take 1,000 pesettes from you for the replacement of the lightning on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to marry.
He forgot his sweater.
That's how Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly where to start.
What a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets for a concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom burned the blinks.
He dictated several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in your pajama?
How much does that cost?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
The bowl of rice weighs approximately 80 grams.
I had to leave Tom's note.
Are you Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom from half the third.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary are doing this together.
Anybody else noticed that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played the sonate.
You can write in any language you want. Tataeba is equal to all languages.
The infection was bleeding.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a gift.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
One day, you'll thank me.
Tom's watching TV sometimes.
Am I ready?
I was waiting for you.
I still think badly.
Run, chickens!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my opinion, we should give more attention to the current situation of things.
I know what you told her.
I'm asleep only after two hours at night.
Mary was not thirsty.
So it wasn't so hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like that.
I tried to wake Tom.
They say that movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of a strong rain.
I guess she's healthy.
Tom was in a slammed hat.
Take care of your brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter pepper.
When do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain adopted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about the money.
There's no invincible.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.
They're stuck.
I didn't know that would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
A man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you die her?
Tom knows French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost one age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to go.
We didn't discuss this.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the beast.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defense.
How does faith differ from trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If weather allows, we'll get to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
We both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to figure out the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read the ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of God Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
His gray eyes brightened and shined, and his familiar facial pale face became alive and covered with ruman.
What kind of pizza do you like most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take another one.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were blue from cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Tyfun ruined a lot of homes.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Can anyone speak French here?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me get your bags.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The power in Tom's hands.
I learned to work and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not really busy right now.
Children prefer to play than learn.
He was considered his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I'm talking in.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on politics talks.
Is that red or white?
We're not afraid of fear.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
I'm going!
Do it before it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom didn't get used to such a job.
Bring your wife.
What, the muscles suddenly come into fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born yesterday.
Tom's pirate suit.
It's a pure truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
The job is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom's got to be here in 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll get you out of here.
We are proud of our achievement.
So we had to invite Mary.
Tom was supposed to be punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She's become a mailman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating a cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know that this man is the one he sees to be?
King Harald Gormsson, more known as Harald Sinosebius, has led Christianity to Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing wrong happened.
The last days were very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to pour flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go in this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very talented and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read German Gesse.
Honestly, I've never spoken Portuguese.
When criminal proceedings come to court, it is generally accepted that there are twelve people in the jury court.
What exactly did Tom do in the Embassy of Australia?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very confused.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acid.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea that Tom was going to do it.
There's another day.
You have to do it right now.
I have to go to the X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was severely damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom's playing tromboons.
You from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds are worldly familiar with their hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a dear gift.
Do you have any opinions?
Do you like these ghosts?
The castle is broken.
The diamond is a precious stone.
Get some biscuits, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Stop it, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to go with us to Boston.
Unfortunately, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom's a waitress.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from degraded self - appreciation?
Was that too simple?
What Alice faced, waiting for an answer, was a sudden voyage; it was a noise that was so rare that she could break her drum bars, and so loud to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We talked about Jim when he got in the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
So you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get things in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
Many books are issued every year.
Tom unwillingly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing car broke.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I was trying to solve the problem thoroughly.
You should have done your homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't pick it up.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
He'll be able to respond.
We've got some canoes.
Have you ever tasted a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
Wealthy people sometimes look highly at the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his sont.
How can we explain this to children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed into a tree.
The language I learn is very complicated.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Are you really living alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom's my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I strongly believe in his innocence.
The President rules four years.
I'm glad you're glad.
I don't know if I'm ready for that.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Can you solve that question?
And Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
In the building of 20 floors.
If you're not going, I'm not going either.
You don't know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have Tom's photos.
Can you wait a minute?
Are you going to give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he followed my advice then, he would be a rich man now.
I made this decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There's a strong wind up.
Tom had no courage to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you do.
We're not as young as Tom.
When are you planning to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn.
I think you can rely on you.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he watched TV.
Tom spoke last night in his dream.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't repeat that!
I called him, but some girl got the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We need to stick to the plan.
I'll tell the Toma that you called.
Tom's very strict with the kids.
How are the negotiations?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I'm mixing majones with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got little whiskey.
Did you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't piss her off.
I'd better stay.
So there was a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a reliable place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect Tom needs to go to Boston next week.
Don't go abroad.
Tom was in a horror watching.
Tom's face is beauty.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stay?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How do you feel about your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very happy.
The hunger for him was an abstract concept; he always had enough food.
The hall needs a new curtain.
Can you stay with them?
Tom's here early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was rain yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
When do you want to leave?
She got her legs hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're envy.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we don't do it again.
How many times did you help Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These precious things are expensive.
I don't know how you do this.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
Until I get there, there's a time for opening.
I'm not sure what size she has.
He was also good to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom put the lamp on and went into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Foma's out of the door.
We have to do it.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
He and I cried.
Would you like to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you so separated?
Of milk can be made of oil, cheese and many other things.
You don't have authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you a relative of her?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her younger daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an unpronounced guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He blinked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
Didn't you think you'd ask for Tom's help?
It's worth it.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in a human language?
No one's hungry but me.
Tom's very excited.
There's no snow snowflake in the snow lab.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'm going to solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When's the store opening?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He broadly opened his mouth.
It's a spit once.
I really liked this book.
You're important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she was staying at her place.
Tom didn't tell the police his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish's still cheese.
Try to remain positive.
I've been hurting.
She choked him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
There was a big red hat on the girl.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was deceived.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who to play with Tom?
I need a light coat.
I've finished my mission.
It's a cat.
Please tell me that's not true.
You're not coming in?
I repaired his radio.
It's a very bad idea.
Tom's above you.
Tom found a job without hard work.
Is that a book in public access?
Please, could you speak louder?
I'll tell Toma to contact Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
Please speak to me, not otherwise than Jacob Matthewwich.
She's not alone anymore.
Tom never admits that he's wrong because he considers it a sign of weakness.
I've been to America before.
It took more time than I thought.
Mary's staying with her father.
I thought I could trust her.
Do you have Steve Vander's new album?
I was thrown out of my house because I didn't pay the rent.
Tell me where you went.
He stopped resisting and obeyed fate.
It happened in Park Street.
Eduardo's younger than Roberto.
The moon is the Earth’s satellite.
I don't know.
There's nothing useless in nature.
No, she never fell in love.
You did it on purpose!
You won't need it.
Tom rarely goes to parties.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're on our way.
Do I look like a guy who wants to get married?
I closed the door, but I didn't lock it.
Therefore, we should be careful not to kiss Mary publicly.
Can we help them?
Thank you for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so severe to me.
Now I command the parade!
People who have a good year for all of us.
I don't feel sorry for you.
I know Tom won't give up.
I don't like her very much.
He's not here.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are planning to marry 20 October.
She thought I'd let her down.
I live in Boston right now.
Tom took his secret with him into his grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?
I don't think anyone else wants to do this.
We're teachers.
You must like me very much.
Why are you so worried about her?
I'll never do that again.
Is there aliens?
Emily wants to be an electrician.
These books are better than those.
Do not try to remember each sentence in the text, it is almost impossible.

Why don't you get something to drink?
We're gathering blankets for homeless people.
Tom paid Mary a very good wage.
What do you think of that?
Let's finish your breakfast.
Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
Never in life!
Did Tom ever ask you to help him?
The chair needs to be fixed.
I thought you were right.
Why are everyone looking at us?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did I correctly say your name?
No one saw her leave the room.
Wa-bank.
Tom will never find him.
All women are the same.
He let them walk in the garden.
I don't have a crustale ball.
Your love is fake.
She's about my age.
Did you really do it for free?
You want me to open the box?
Boys will always be boys and girls.
You need to get down.
There is nothing new in his addiction to alcohol.
He doesn't realize the risk.
So you don't have to do that anymore.
Do you have any idea who could have done this?
The teacher warned us that the examination would probably be complicated.
I'm a married man.
He bought his son a camera.
Shut up and eat.
I gave you everything.
I'm dedicating this song to you.
I like her more.
You're too small to know what a logarithmic ambulance is.
I've done that almost every day.
I'm deeply shocked.
About a billion people suffer from hunger and poverty.
I'm glad to tell you that your work was taken to the publication in the SM.
I'm convinced of my right.
I didn't know you wanted to learn French.
Let's go home.
You have time.
I'm not coming.
Tom doesn't waste much time thinking about money.
So we have to go with Mary.
I wonder what Tom is doing here.
You're not all-powered.
I don't think I can go faster.
Tom has questions left.
Are you looking for someone?
Tom's hand tasted the mureen.
So we didn't have to hide.
He'll leave his home soon.
I don't think he'll hear us.
I want to go to England.
Have you seen anyone in the park?
Didn't I warn you not to go there?
Tom moved here from Australia three years ago.
She left Boston.
We need to consider all options.
Tom could have killed me.
Grandpa Ali was a drumman.
Why didn't anyone tell us?
He's walking in a pajama.
In an entract, I went to look for Tom in the lobby.
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
He's less aware of his problems.
Tom claimed that he saw UFO.
I know who you were with.
Does Tom have a bike?
What did you ask them?
It's a good fix.
I'm breakfast every morning.
It's not a bag, it's a fitch.
Do you have trouble with the car?
The city map was issued in the tourist information center.
I'm sorry, but I can't.

Learn Chinese not to impress your future boss, but to understand what she says.
You can add suggestions that you can't translate yourself.
Mary's always home, isn't she?
Just don't pay attention to Tom.
I don't think I'm in charge.
I'm sorry I didn't notice that.
I'm teaching.
I knew Tom was bluffing.
I've been trying all my best.
That's a good sign.
Some believe that they are protected by the guardian angel.
Tom's emptied his bank account.
She's in the hotel right now.
What do I think I'm gonna do?
He was so curious that he paid his attention to it.
I told him I didn't care.
Tom wants to change society.
I thought you didn't see anything.
We're both here for the same reason.
Love is stronger, so money is stronger.
I saw him naked.
There are many child books in our library.
I didn't let her home early.
Did you talk to her?
How long will it take to get there?
I didn't want to interrupt you.
We all wished each other good luck.
Tom was born three days before Christmas in 2013.
A young girl was silent.
When Tom heard his favorite song on the radio, he couldn't refrain from singing.
When will this end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologized.
The drawn spot still left a trail on the suit.
Is Tom dating anyone?
Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving a car.
They're fake.
When you came back, I left.
Did you talk to him today?
I thought you stopped seeing him.
Tom's calling Mary.
She's pouring flowers.
My wife often calls me when she's on abroad.
You're in bed.

I'm glad you were there.
They made me a big party.
This mountain is covered by snow for a year.
Tom stopped at Mary's store to buy sugar.
I like being red.
Stay away from here.
What's the worst movie you've ever seen in your life?
I thought you hated us.
Think well before you answer.
Tom says Mary needs more time.
I thought it was a joke and didn't answer it.
In fact, his name wasn't Tom Jackson.
Is that sarcasm?
Don't do what you'll regret.
You envy her?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
Payment will be made depending on experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to sport.
Tom told me you were married.
I thought I wouldn't stay.
We're looking forward to you and your family.
Did you change her?
I told you I changed my mind.
Why did you say that?
You need to work hard if you want to make a success.
There are no exceptions in the Esperanto.
If you need help, tell me.
Can I go home early today?
You wouldn't have survived for anything.
Tom didn't think Mary would upset it.
There is a trade area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
That's interesting news.
Tom is a bitter drunk.
We don't even know her.
Tom made a few proposals and checked them on Mary before she poured on Tataeba.
I know where you hide your money.
The school's finally over.
It's a long pen.
Does your mother know about that?
Do you really like this kind of food?
Tom looked in the mirror.
I told them not to tell anyone.
That's how Tom died.
The cafeteria's empty.
Write with the pencil, please.
We can't leave.
He confessed in his crime.
It's the most beautiful picture I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
He's worried about something.
Sometimes Claudia thought about psychoanalysis.
Tom would never agree on that.
You need to find a job.
He'll be back late tonight, too.
She's very proud of herself.
I left about half the third.
Don't leave the tape on the sun.
I already knew that.
I watched them leave.
I'm surprised you remember them.
Hey, I know you.
"Help me, help me!" screamed Pierretta.
Can I open the curtain?
You had no right to do that.
I'm yours.
He vomited as much as he had.
Let the earth be your daddy!
Why are you still alone?
I want us to be friends with your sister.
Who did you wait here yesterday?
You like singing?
The road's slippery.
Tom's making breakfast.
Come in.
I'm keeping them for my grandchildren.
I heard Carol and Will divorced.
How do you feel, Tom?
Tom says he never did that.
Tom seems to be a nice man.
Help me find her.
Tom didn't give it to me.
I had to go under the fence.
Firemen couldn't hold the flame.
Assistance finally came.
It's a horse.
That's what happened here on Monday.
America has ended slavery.
You don't recognize him?
Fortunately, he didn't die in an accident.
He often sits for hours reading the books.
I had no idea you could do that.
Tom unloaded the car.
Tom knew about Mary something that John didn't know.
There's no answer.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I've had a negative head in my head.
Tom, they're calling you.
You promised not to drink tonight.
You ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Look what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think it works like that.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd be back.
When are you coming tomorrow?
A hole box.
Did you talk to Tom about it?
Is that a flying mouse?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I need to know.
You can't make me marry you.
That's pretty weird.
The leaves are yellow.
I woke up and she's gone.
We have plenty of food today.
He spoke with a speech in which he supported my view.
The Killimanjaro Mountain is a sleeping volcano in Tanzania.
Why don't you go with her?
Why didn't you just tell them?
I can't exclude it.
Tom asked me why I never tried to get drivers.
I have to go back to Boston.
Have a seat, please.
Wake up Tom.
Here's the map.
You should have stayed with us.
Let's imagine we're aliens.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
I have nothing to tell you.
I'd rather you don't tell Tom about it.
I didn't want to go anyway.
I'm not going to complain.
They kept their love in secret.
She only hurried to the station to be late for the train.
Don't tell my bride that.
Tom's tired of always paying the bill when Mary and I are dating.
I urge you to review your decision.
I don't care about your past.
The police searched Tom's car.
Although I felt that there was something strange, I didn't know what it was.
Are you a pig?
I went to the army.
Why can't you accept me as I am?
The bear's black.
Tom doesn't know what Mary did.
I don't know who's going to be at the meeting.
It's hard to approach the president.
If you're hungry, eat.
I was terribly scared.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll do it right away.
I don't trust her.
Sixty three equals eighteen.
‘Scala’ is anagram ‘laski’.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan participated in a racism event.
You did it quickly.
I need to get my watch two minutes ahead.
He's on her side.
I didn't forget your betrayal.
I think you've done great.
She danced so gracefully that she surprised all of us.
That's where she worked as a secretary.
They're not that bad.
I thought I had everything.
Don't worry, it's gonna be okay.
I'm hard to work with Tom.
I'm competitive.
He says his son can count up to 100.
Something's wrong here.
Tom hates these things.

Why didn't they go?
I heard you paid someone to do it.
It's for my friend.

The Tulip is the official flower symbol of our prefecture.
I knew we'd be friends.
I didn't want to lose him.
She's in the hotel right now.
I'm gonna give you some karate lessons.
Don't worry about my dog.
Tom's cremated tomorrow.
It's not true.
You're not allowed to do this anymore.
During the summer holidays, tourists in Caruidsau were inflammed.
I saw Tom sitting on the train.
He didn't do anything wrong.
She's wearing glasses.
I love that advertisement.
It was just water.
I bought it for my sister.
I'll never forget how she and I went to Hawaii.
No one heard the call.
How did it get here?
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to fight.
I'd love to go with you, but I can't.
The world's policies condemned terrorists on 11 September for their decent punishment.
Please call me Taro.
I know both of them.
Don't you want to meet him?

I didn't want it to be the same with me.
I don't know all the students.
Thank you very much, you just ruined my life!

Peace for you.
I'm tired of a white guy.
Tom is a cruel businessman.
I can't go on Saturday.
We're getting married in October.
Tom and Mary don't agree with you.
We'll visit you soon.
Let's divorce.
He won't find the keys at all.
It's her way of talking me nervous.
Eat what you like.
And then what happened?
You think he likes me?
Tom agreed to help Mary do that.
He prefers not to talk about it.
I let them sleep until noon.
I just wanted to get back to my old life.
I'm sorry I shouted at you.
I already told you everything you should know about it.
Health gives a person the freedom that most don't realize until he loses it.
Is that important?
I know Tom's secret.
Tom is a man.
That's ridiculous.
No one could believe it.
Tell her I'm repairing the refrigerator.
That's not surprising.
The rabbit's bleeding out of his ear.
Postmoderism is different from modernism.
I've read this book before.
Damn it!
He shows great enthusiasm.
Maybe you should call the police.
Did you report that to the police?
Do you really think Tom's sick?
I'm not afraid of that at all.
I don't have much money you think.
I'm selling clothes on the Internet.
I could've done it faster when I was younger.
I wasn't worried.
John, the highest boy in our class, is called "Mr. Heights."
Tom's leaving tomorrow morning.
I didn't kill them.
Do you recognize him?
I didn't really care.
Tom has a horse.
I shouldn't have come here.
Don't do that acid face!
It's white?
Tom's here first.
There were strange rumours about them.
That's incredible.
The sky is covered by the sky.
This bird is in danger of extinction.
You've been very happy with her.
How are you?
Tom didn't look like he was having fun.
I'm sick of everyone's throat.
You said it's important.
He said he'd be back right now.
They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the village called her Green Hatter.
I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids in bed.
You can break away from this job.
I had a rest.
Tom won't mind.
There's nothing.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the medication?
Many people believe in the corruption of our country officials.
Did he cut off his pants?
I can't distinguish him from my brother.
We can count on him.
I'll go with her.
Did the phone wake you up?
I really need to get someone.
I don't think Tom has any experience.
Come here now.
In the last winter, I traveled to Canada to ride skies.
That's acceptable.
Tom says he could prove Mary didn't do that.
I was born on 2 January 1968.
I want you to stay away from Tom.
Tom just got out of jail.
Animal entrance is allowed.
Tom's full of hope.
He speaks French and, of course, English.
Move this stone out of there, please.
"That's getting married." "And who's a happy elector?"
I've been thinking about you all day.
That's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I impressed him.
The train will be on this station for about two minutes.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
Where do you think it would be safer?
I know your father.
I heard you shout.
He's the boy who painted this picture.
"Call up" means calling on the phone.
Who would have noticed?
Medicines should only be used in accordance with the physician's instructions.
Do you have a question?
They went into the woods.
I'm talking too much.
You show the way.
The sun shines brightly.
The coral reefs are living.
Tom said he knew what Mary was planning to do.
You never wanted to talk about it.
We hope for the best.
I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
Last night, the temperature fell below zero.
"You can't wear it."
Tom's done a bad job.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
My eyes are the ocean in which my dreams are reflected.
In a large city like Tokyo, I prefer to walk, not to ride a car.
As it turned out here, it's impossible to find out now.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
A number of votes were fabricated.
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom can help you right now.
He'll probably be there soon.
He had no idea what a differential equation was.
I know that for sure.
Get upstairs, Tom.
Can you distinguish Tom from his twin brother?
I'm not paid for this.
Tom screwed the boards with a knife break.
Don't move.
How did you know where Tom was?
She says she'll do it on Monday.
Tom's eating too fast.
The popularity of the phone has led to the fact that fewer people write letters today.
I think we're almost ready.
My wife arrived in our town three years ago.
Is that why you won't help us?
My puppy died, and I'm terribly upset.
She's above her sister.
I have a pink car.
So quiet.
The most beautiful colors have the sharpest spices.
You better hide.
Tom follows instructions.
It's not gonna happen.
They can't afford it.
What colors do you like?
She says she feels very tired.
Doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know what Iraq is different from Iran.
So they said not to do it on their own.
Two days ago, I got cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's get some coffee in that coffee or something.
You got something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom, he'll tell you the same thing.
Sammy saw that helicopter and had to wave with his hands.
I'm with you.
You want to finish like him?
I thought about him.
I'm waiting for someone.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no conditioning in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his offer.
I admire your courage.
Tom was hoping Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do that again.
It's your turn, Bashar!
You're unfair.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
Excuse me, could you repeat the question?
What do you think they'll do to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary will do that.
I don't want anyone to do that.
Tom's going to work this weekend.
Tell her, please I called.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The president's attempts to strictly control the weapons once by time crossed the powerful weapon lobby.
I think we're familiar.
You underestimate Tom.
Don't worry, Tom.
I'll try to express that in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
You have enough time.
We should have planned more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud that my father is a good cook.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
Foma tried to explain the situation of Masha.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
No one's been paying attention to me.
So it was thirteen at the time.
I'm going to Boston on the bus.
Tom wants to try a new champon.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay ahead.
Did you make coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Take a nice suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
It's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in jail.
We're sick for Spartacus!
That's how he showed his feast.
Why did Tom need him?
It's a capital contribution.
It's really bitter.
It was not enough time for that.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network, transmission.
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've read this before.
It's because of you.
As long as certain conditions are met.
She's not like everyone else.
Social networks provide a lot of information about a person before meeting him.
What really happened last weekend in Boston?
What is the point of learning?
These breasts aren't very sweet.
I don't think these ink dots can be pulled out.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay.
I can't forgive his lazy.
Tell me you're kidding me!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom was excluded from school.
Tom said he was very lonely.
I didn't tell my friends I was going to Australia.
Kim is four years older than me.
Why aren't you in shape?
Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
Tom sent his daughter to sleep without dinner.
I'm going with you.
They cleaned the street of snow.
Tom and Mary have to do this together.
They offered us their help.
Tom decided to kiss Masha.
Are you very hungry?
What's going to happen to him?
Tom and I are associate friends.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
Tom's kind of famous.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I've seen them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The painting hangs on the walls.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Is Tom with you?
The boy is afraid of darkness.
I prepared Tom's dinner.
Russia has become the second supernational.
I'm worried about them, too.
He went to the mail to send a letter.
Get this powder in a glass of water.
Will you go with her?
Let's take one of those ready lunches that are sold at the station.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in place.
How did you know each other?
Who sent that letter?
Drop your guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rental salary for the apartment in Manhattan is approximately $4,000 per month.
You won't find them.
Tom's the only one who survived.
Are you going to buy this car?
You sound like my grandmother.
I don't have family brothers.
Let's see something else.
Do you think that's the exact translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted to eat.
That's why there's nothing to do.
Try not to worry about us.
Stay here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock the door with your hand.
You have to take into account his age.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
Tom started to suspect something's wrong.
What if he's back right now?
If you're tired, sleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
Didn't you know Mary was Tom's wife?
I have to go on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going to lunch on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
You don't turn off the radio?
I don't remember exactly what Tom said.
Tom is an artificial player.
I wasn't ready for that.
Look at that girl.
Tom has a vivid imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you saying?
You left the bar yesterday when I was going to put everyone a drink on my account.
Tom told me it really works.
I want to play chess.
I'm supporting you 100%.
I haven't seen you for almost three years.
You should tell her what you feel.
I have a light headache.
I heard about what happened.
We rarely have snow here.
Don't open this box.
I hate waiting.
Sometimes I see him in the club.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
It was fun yesterday.
Where did Tom get these photos?
Panic is useless.
Hey, you know what?
I spent three days in Boston.
I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom hit him off his feet.
Tom tried to stop Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to do more.
You're the only one who can order money.
How is it related to each other?
I could do it much faster than Tom.
Don't feed trolles.
Where's Tom sleeping?
I won't tell you.
Why are you still here?
Equator divides the land into two hemispheres.
He's a landed man.
I've never seen anything like that.
The trees give a shadow.
She was taken with a polish.
Tom doesn't know where it is.
Tom doesn't know where Mary works.
I agreed with Tom.
I have so much to say.
The answer is yes.

Tom was doing this all morning.
I realize the consequences.
The city splits the river into the eastern and west parts.
Why are you jumping?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
Is that why it was awful?
Tom invited me to stay at night.
I don't think Tom is guilty.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed by your French.
We both want to do it.
If the ice gets warm, it grows.
We could've done it.
The doctor said Tom needed surgery.
I've changed my tooth paste recently.
Here's something for you.
This is your bedroom.
Tom's realistic.
Who's knocking on the door to me?
When and where did you and Tom meet?
I'm here to visit you.
I feel like an ammediate.
Our team came home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married an older girl.
I listened to him.
Why are you not sleeping?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you cry.
Show me how to do that!
Everybody's silent.
Let the dust go.
Why are you so stubborn?

I can't make an exception.
He thinks fast.
I can find them.
I'm here right now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to TV.
I've got my head almost every day.
Unfortunately, he didn't give up his account.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father loves fishing like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan was an advocate of the superiority of the white race.
I'll try to distract them.
I like your shirt's color.
It's not me, I swear!

I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's better cooking than me.
He's swimming like a sea.
Tom didn't tell Mary he needed to buy.
She brought a broom.
"Tom, hurry." - "I'm coming!"
I'm having a big problem.
We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'll try to say that in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I managed to get two tickets for a concert.
He likes to brag about his father's successful car business.
She's in sun-protection glasses.

How many hours can you sit in front of your computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Minus by negative gives a plus.
In the basement's body.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
Nothing to tell.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara, Turkey's capital.
I went to the bean.
I prefer a simple approach.
They're cool.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane's goodbye speech made us very sad.
I'm trying not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
Look awkward.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't keep the smile.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "the boy"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is a recognition that you didn't even know.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should have thought well before you made her pregnant.
Tom says he won't marry Mary.
I caught two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's bleeding.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Can I come, too?
Does Tom earn enough to live in town?
The interrogation is over.
Please turn off the radio.
He seemed uncertain about his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if you're warm.
So many of them.
He couldn't follow the principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
You're probably gonna have three hours to do this.
It was a easy solution.
Mary said she'd be here early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
It could be anyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was a Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is gifted with rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The point is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom to sing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I didn't have anything wrong in my mind.
Tom maintains cleanness in his room.
These three books belong to Tom.
He was jumping from one to another.
It's a reconciliation.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's coming in.
It's not cold today.
I mistakenly wore Tom's shirt.
Looks like the bank robbery was planned till the tiny.
That's why he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Stay a little.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank's empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was bathing in the river.
Tell them to take off the phone.
Can you tell us what that is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a meatman, isn't it?
Don't force me to kill you!
What do you like more?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
You don't mean us.
You can't answer.
Tom's got a lot of books.
Can you distinguish the aligator from the crocodile?
Wait, what's that?

You really want me to tell Toma that you killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
The whole nation was touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous it is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
All right, everybody, listen, please.
Is it made of a tree or a metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom's my friend.
The nation, counting to remain ignorant and free, counts on what has never been and will never be.
Tom's barely breathing.
Dogs don't distinguish colors.
Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are faithful animals.
The house of Tom was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
On the lake, two boats.
I won't give you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
Better be alone than a bad company.
It's the wrong data.
There is a significant difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom is lazy.
We have to tell Toma not to do that again.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's pretending.
Come closer.
We stayed at the Hilton Hotel.
That's why we should tell Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I asked Mary to wait.
She kept complaining that there were no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
There's something to do.
She gave him a gift.
Mary's doing it in her room.
Everybody's attention!
At that moment, I fell in love with this language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
You ordered that pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom's my close friend.
Don't do two cases at the same time.
You weren't supposed to go to the woods alone.
No one can see my tears.
Tom was asleep again.
She really likes you.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are multiplied.
Tom never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very happy to meet you.
I almost forgot the meeting.
They had a wedding last autumn.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everyone knows we didn't do it.
I thought Tom was never in Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five years old.
We regretted the noise manager of the neighbors.
I'm not gonna let you do this.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need this.
Honestness is one of the virtues.
As you meet the new year, you'll spend it.
There is no book in French in the library.
Each summary is dangerous, especially such.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write this with a hyragma, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you like me.
Behave your age accordingly.
You know how to žongl?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged welcomes.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they weren't coming.
I can't bear the kind of animal suffering.
I think Daddabe's delaying today.

I'm looking forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He made a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's bored here.
Do you see the star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
You said so often.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been.
Can't we fire her?

I told them the bank wasn't working.

He's got a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I feel very sorry for Tom.
There's nothing to show me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
Tom didn't tell us why he was so upset.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know that better than anyone else.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You don't have anything to hide, do you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account should be paid until the first number of the next month.
My French is horrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold city, not that Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an extortion attempt.
I can't speak for a colleague.
Is Tom living far from you?
Why didn't I die?
The fight ended with a fight.
I didn't take it, you can check your pockets.
Tom came here yesterday.
I'd like to leave the call.
You chose the wrong man.
They took a lot of risks.
We have a white cat.
You may never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home yesterday?
If anyone can do that, then Tom.

Tom was hard to find.
Everyone dance!
I live with Tom.
That's where I met them.
You're not losing time.
Your problem is that you're lacking patience.
Several events marked the occurrence of the twenty-first century.
Stop doing this, Tom.
Tom said he wasn't planning to do that.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told Toma to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said there could be no talk about it.
He got out of bed.
The trains follow according to the schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think that it is impossible not to confuse languages.
Why does Tom avoid me?
Is the examination going to be today?
What motivates you?
Sammy gave Layle his computer.
Put your sleeve on.
I was hoping you'd be back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet us?
They say anyone in America can be president, but it's probably not.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first name on the list is Tom.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
When's the train coming?
How long is this train coming to Boston?
Didn't you see that?
You need to call me.
Tom never suspected Mary and John were dating each other.
When I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I baked his cookies.
It's a neighbouring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you a little more time to think.
Translate it to French, please.
Take the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd was rapidly increasing.
Mary told me she loved me.
Tom told me about what happened.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to cold.
We're looking for you!
She's all loved.
Compare your answers to Tom's answers.
Tom has a weak heart.
So I'll have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you borrow me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his head beard.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do it on your own.
No one saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to go back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I finally did it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test is light.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know what book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white boy-paper shirt.
It's a tower.
I'll have to wait.
It was Sunday yesterday, not Saturday.
Anybody here knows them?
They're watching you.
How long do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He knows about his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's dressed in a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks anyone for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
In this city, there are many broad prospects.
What are you talking about?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to marry next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, did you?
She's got a double beard.
We can't make the people do that.
Let me take it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand that color.
Are they sleeping together?
We are very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know what you knew.
I won't let her in.
The neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I've never spoken to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Toma.
She has deficiencies.
I'm wondering why he needs it.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom isn't the only one in Boston here.
Will you support me?
What don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
You have to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter will soon be over.
The titles and rewards don't mean anything to me.
Where did you even find him?
The meeting's delayed.
I'll recognize you.
Have you had a good weekend?
Tom's drinking a beer.
If you don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring Tome a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Get together!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we'll lose.
I can't call him home.
You had to apologize to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom looks like a optimist.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I've done everything I can to help Tomu.
I'm connecting you to her.
She received the highest assessments.
Tom can be jealous.
I think you're gonna be very busy tonight.
What color is your childhood associated with?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the benefit of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom used an outdoor homecrat.
I'd like to get down.
Give me some papers for notes or something like that.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight, and I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here tonight.
Cat's dead.
It's only half the ninth?
Tom went to the shop to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's not safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me tonight.
Tom doesn't look very well.
She put her hands on her to warm them up.
Tom said glad you were back.
My car's covered with dove shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Laurie's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not going to make this mistake anymore.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I convinced her to marry him.
I've been waiting for this day all my life.
What did they do to you?
Did he surrender the exam?
The plane went into the barrel.
It wasn't him.
Do you have friends in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary's lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play a chess with you.
Will you come with me to a concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to see you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where's your sockets?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
That won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hi," said Tom strictly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
It hurts.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how much time.
They're running.
The road does not match the number of vehicles through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal as a letter in the bottle: one day it will be translated.
You can't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everybody loved you.
He and I are related souls.
I have a granddaughter of your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She started conquering in her new office.
Let us take care of it.
I guess you're sitting in my seat.
I was planning to do it yesterday.
It's a little early to drink a drink, isn't it?
My parents don't like my way of dressing.
Whoever wants to stay, can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him cleverly and strongly.
Because it's worse?
It's not expensive.
Can I take your hand?
It's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't go to bed all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about celluli.
You need to start watching when all the seasons are taken off!
Road accidents happen daily.
Where did you go riding skies?
You were in the beans?
The perspective is disturbing.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ball pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed my exam.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
Footballist made a huge mistake.
Are they coming, too?
She's asleep like a baby.
Tom forgot to let the brake go.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The explosion shakes the entire building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they huged.
It's my cat.
Do you have children already?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
They like Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was excluded from school.
Tom's an untrusted idiot.
This doesn't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I guess you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat go.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks that throwing food is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place scrolls right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has made a lot better.
Let's go to church.
Tom's whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's responding.
I've never met him any more.
How much did it cost?
I need to see you right now.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
The sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I was before.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he would never do that.
The stoleer will steal the cow.
Tom's not swimming well, is he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just the shadow of his old man.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Anything happens.
What day is it?
Let's give Tomu another chance.
I just want you to take me as I am.
I'm an ordinary guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Is that true, Paul kissed Lily in his lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't even say he'd come with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I should stay together.
I've heard only good about him.
I don't work here anymore.
What do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You're not compared to us.
I saw the car exploded.
The window's here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never drop my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite television?
You want to go to the movie tomorrow?
Thank you for worrying.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll be lost.
I like to go to school.
I offered help.
I'll be back to Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son from me.
I think her father is a lawyer.
I want to see a volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything.
Tell him I'm going to go to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer put the courage in his people.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying things like that right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
The first time I cook meat at home on a grill.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many songs do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone already knew that.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You shouldn't lie.
I know Tom's just gonna cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom should be home.
She was the one I thought about.
Tom showed his driver's rights to the police.
I'm shaving every month.
I told you I didn't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
This apple's acid.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go.
Are you taking a job home?
According to mythology, Prometheus abducted sacred fire from gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers managed to get out of the bus before he burned.
I want to help you handle this.
You speak French better than me.
There's a lot of talented people in our city, but Tom doesn't.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars flooded in the night sky.
I doubt Tom will win.
"Eh, here you are so boring." "My boy, all are looking for this world..." "'Here and I, Your Majesty, Genon and his servants have captured the island of Coriday." "'Hm-hm. What we can..." "How can we..." "How can the Linc only conquer Genon." "How can we..." "How can we..." "How is it my sword!" "The Sword No." "Ah?" "The Sword No!" -- "The Sword of No!" -- "How the Skull with the Skull." "No." "And how about "ah, daddy!"
Do you know who's singing this song?
Your watch is going right?
See you on Sunday at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom barely knows how to swim.
You're doing this well.
I met her on my way home from school.
I didn't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?
Tom wanted to learn to read.
I'm going to Tome's house.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed money.
Tom helped Mary put together blankets.
A is a multitude consisting of elements c, b and a.
I'll be back at nine.
He's got diabetes.
We can deal with them.
I just wondered if you had any experience you'd like to share with us.
Tom was sleeping without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What kind of music are you listening to in the car?
I was told three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French revolution began during the rule of Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get a invitation from Tom?
I want to bath in the sea.
It'll be all depending on him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our city was occupied with a skill.
No one saw them walk out of the room.
Two big coffee, please.
We talked about you.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, there's no food.
It's gonna be snow tomorrow.
You should have quit smoking a long time ago.
Stop joking!
Some of my classmates are full of nuts, they don't know anything about computers.
Did you like the bike?
I thought Tom wasn't sleeping.
So they were not allowed to leave.
I didn't find them right away.
Please hurry up, Tom's waiting.
Listen to what the teacher says.
She looks awesome like Marilyn Monroe.
I know who we can call for help.
I'm stronger than you.
She felt deep regret when she looked at her life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
I swear I didn't see her.

She's an honest man.
We'll miss you.
These are for me.
I'm learning to drive a car.

Tom was sitting with John in the same cell.
I didn't want to swim.
He's got a beer.
At present, a man is the hardest thing to be himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, Tom, wake up!
I'll get my nose coats tightened.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all kids.
She went out of her mind and shouted at me.
Did you take your medication?
The rabbits are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Did you want to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still angry.
You'll be better in the morning.
What are you saying to them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell the burning tire?
That's not what happened here.
When will your father come home?
I understand.
Tom stretched up Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of the shower.
Tom's patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary aren't married.
Tom's gonna try to run.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's deaf.
Tom said that's not enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring a salad for the party.
Her hair is wet from sweat.
I only buy a soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much that weighs?
The boatliner is a complimentary master.
Tom's married to Mary, isn't he?
All the storms in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I'm working on it.
Vermont is located on the border with Canada.
He had to live in the same room with his brother.
I'm not an imbecile.
You're gonna fix it, right?
I don't know how to hunt.
He has a brother in Tokyo.
Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We need to interfere.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you shouldn't do this.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already spoken to this student.
What chemical sign is the bromhydrous acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in the shadow.
I asked Tom.
So we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do that.
Cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a palace.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
The sky is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.
I don't think Tom wants to come with you to Boston.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine calls cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
I wish I could just go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late to school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
How long are you planning on staying?
We've eaten instantly, and we're gone.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't throw anything on your feet.
Start every food from the soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right across me.
The cartridge was open.
I brought the wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to meet you to death.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
The apples are big.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
Is she singing?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom was interested in listening.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's go on the car.
You're interrupting me.
She was wondering what his lips would taste.
A good coach trains this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was detained because of a strong snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
Why do you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It should have been you.
Mary left my hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning to do it or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing a new shoe.
Last year she learned to ride a bike.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since there was winter, he didn't go out.
On the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses on your street?
The elephants are made of elephant bone.
I'm not a baby anymore.
"How's life, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
Her own French.
It's a coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naiveness is his only positive quality.
My hobby is the collection of insects.
Tom's baby lived in Boston.
I haven't eaten six days.
Can I tell them about it?
She was silent all day.
No matter what he can say, don't trust him.
I went on.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very welcome, and she's got a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies are asleeping under collapse.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could have learned a lot of them if you were just listening.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
Sorry to disturb you.
The one who has never left the borders of his country is full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it becomes when the snow falls.
Tom helps his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
Many people in India are holy animals.
I've incorporated my imagination.
I thought we could do it.
My mom was against driving alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't understand you.
You know what you're doing, right?
The machine translation cannot be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
She and I are peers.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
The prisoner is released.
What, they said, happened?
Could you leave the door open?
We'll have to wait for that.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's two older than me.
Tom knows it was a mistake.
In Japan, it is soft climate.
Check it again.
Don't condemn Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced a traumatic player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our journey went very smoothly.
It's inevitable that I'm going to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's just pretending to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain stopped, you can open the windows again.
I've never been like that before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going to go out when the phone ringed.
I don't have to endure this.
Always step away from the road to the right.
We're asked to be presented in a row.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's nice, but I don't like her.
I can give you a ride if you want.
Tom told Mary she wasted her time for nothing.
Are you still in trouble with this?
I never asked her.
Nothing is as relaxing as a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's a open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about it.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
Your voice sounds like a song of cheese for me.
How is it being married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why he didn't like Mary.
My fingers left fingerprints on the glass.
Chemistry is a great science.
I feel like my French doesn't get much better.
How can I get the passport best?
You may be able to help Tom.
Tom is the best drumman I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom didn't pay attention to Mary all day.
Tom has fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
There's still a light outside.
I gave my sister a vocabulary.
It's my father's car, but it'll be mine soon.
Did you forget his name?
If I had time to do this, I would have done it.
Do you see Tom's boat?
That's a big foma?
This medication will help you.
Stop the noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I don't have anyone to trust.
She is a worshiper of the Sex in the Great City.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Be good with him.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do that?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing is compared to a glass of beer after a long working day.
What's wrong?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will it take?
Let's rest here.
Are you in new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She's got a grimass when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Smoking is strictly protected.
This bress is beautiful.
Can you see that?
Tom's not excited.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good job!
You used to say that yourself.
Here's a few letters for you.
It is almost unthinkable that the scientist would have made such a basic mistake.

He can play tennis very well.
She confused students.
She said she was a Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you going to tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the shop upstairs.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What house do you live in?
I told them that was ridiculous.
What are we living for?
Will the rain be this afternoon?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I don't often drive a car.
That's why I don't like the ending of the movie.
Just get in there.
Just ask him to forgive him.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventure.
Tom's in the library.
You were at school that time?
You're not changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be a big snowfall.
We decided to move the meeting next Sunday.

Tom did his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I'm sleeping a little bit.
You're gonna get there sometime.
Tom's fine with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you don't."
He came and got on his knees.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Did Tom do this for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom's making three times more money than Mary.
I was drinking milk.
It's gonna be snow tomorrow.
Isn't life wonderful?
When it comes to cooking, no one can compare with Mary.
You're not your own lately.

I burned it for you.
We'll do it as soon as the time comes.
Next year I'll be three times older than you.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your collection of brands.
It'll take eternity.
Tom's not even above Mary.
Looks like no one knows him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This tissue's on your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's almost winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to do that.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his guitar professional game.
Now I'm married.
It was just a few times.

It's not surprising," Tom answered.
We want to take off the apartment in the city.
They spoke French.
It's extremely expensive.
He's not singing anymore.

I'm glad you offered it.
It's hard to answer.
You don't believe her?
English is a world language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told Tome to leave Mary alone.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why does He need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of darkness.
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a car used instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you good luck.
She's breaking up.
I won't let you take my children.
Don't give them to him.
Run or you'll be arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom made it a rule to meditate every morning.
Did you check your calculations?
He tried to make a short story.
A room without books, like a body without soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What does your brother do?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure this won't happen again?
I haven't seen you for a hundred years.
I visited Tony yesterday.
It's easy to make an impression.
You're old enough to do it alone.
Aristotel believed that the Earth was the center of the universe.
Interestingly, what Tom really meant.
No one understands me.

Everyone turned around and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in Arctic.
I told you I was the best of all.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask you to do something several times.
Let's have the bowl wash today whoever loses a paper stone!
How unhappy I am!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He speaks Russian, at least that's what he said to me.
Tom's a third-year-old.
How long will you stay?

Thank you for helping.
We only have three rules.

Tom saw Mary go into the shop.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would probably win.
The Japanese would never do that.

She keeps writing letters.
I don't know who to consult with.
Turn left on the corner.
Tom taught me how to do this.
You can do much more.
Give me one, please.
I can't bear disobedient children.
Tom bought it to me.
What you said is pissed everyone off.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for 30 years.
She showed her talents.
I wish that was possible.
I guess you can't do that.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
The next school festival, Bob, will play the main role for the first time.
You have to stay in shape.
I've been screwing the seeds all day.
On the accent, I realized he was an American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Sympathetic!

All people of my generation think the same way.
I live for that.
You know how to ride skies?
The Duke owns many lands.
At least have fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting better.
You'll feel like home.
It's not gonna end well!

I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who is Norman Finkelstein?" "American politician."
Get out of here!
If it's not the sale of goods at home, maybe it's a new way to get to know girls?
Tom picked up a coin.
Why didn't you clean up in your room?
If God is not there, it's all allowed.
We both are Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything as appropriate.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please put your belts on the flight and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both like marine products.
I've waited a long time.
I rejected the proposal.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
I'll take too much time to explain why it won't work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all this yourself?
I look forward to the summer vacation.
Can we formulate it differently?
That's where he looks great.
The wooden houses are easy to burn.
Let's get Todd's party.
The dog is still alive.
I'm going to university.
I know you lied.
The bed is very comfortable.
I'll make a report tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's a pussy.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait for him to come here.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know Mary's shoes size.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was appointed on Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everyone's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged a meeting?
I'm such a lucky guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the suit.
What bird can't fly?
This has to be done.
Tom didn't answer immediately.

Life is a gift.
Tom also speaks French.
The invention of the transistor marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.

I hate spine.
Mother's cooking lunch.
Tom's a pilgrim.
What can I do?
Her son's genius.
I know you've seen horrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He is inclined to give emotions free.
We were shocked by the news of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You just figure out what's obvious.
He had cancer.
You're guilty of what happened.
He's as precise as a watch.
I know where you're going.
You're getting everything on the flight.
Let's move it.
Let's leave it until tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaning woman interrupted the conversation.
It's a cat on the writing table.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not chroming anymore.
Tom was a rough smoker.
Tom wore gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to that weather.
I'm wondering who's gonna help him decorate the snowfish?
I still don't know why Tom did this.
Do you believe in family souls?
What's that noise?
My son's inheritance sickness.
That's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best protection is a attack.
She's getting married this autumn.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Can we help you with something?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When will you be ready to go?
The investigations began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's it going?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
How did you think you couldn't?
We went back through Boston.
Who's going to believe that?
Thank you for fixing it.
Are you crazy?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get this scarf?
They wanted evidence.
Tom's rolling his pencil.
Tom doesn't know how to ride a bike.
I'm not talking about a teluga at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 for one day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They didn't succeed in time.
It's seven thirty.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who told Tom that.
Tom got up early to see the dawn.
Dinosaurs died a long time ago.
I'm usually climbing up the steps in one.
Tom had that year.
I'm around the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, aren't you?
Put it on my desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of it.
You were ready.
Do you know brother Tom?
All the gussers can put their eggs away.
You'll pay for what you did.
I'm out of my hands today.
I asked them to stay away from this.
Tom only learned how to drive at 30.
I'm glad he wasn't hurt.
Neither did Tom nor Mary learn French.
I haven't laughed like that for a long time.
The kitchen knife was not sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my peanut knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You will soon adapt to the rural life.
Keep the blanket close to the water.
You're not a kid anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all agreed.
There's a river deeper than that.
Thank you with all your heart.
I told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
You should probably tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing words separately in cases where they should be written a great problem in Norwegian.
What are you doing with the remains of the rice prepared?
It's been ten years since she died.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Anything else you need?
We left soon after that.
This book is worth reading.

I don't want your tea.

I'll get you at six.
I'm teaching the French language of Toma.
I love teaching other languages.
Mary has brown eyes.
I'd like to know how long Tom plans to stay in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
What did you feel?
Let's give him a chance.
I like fruit.
Tom lied.
He's dealing with cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate an icrus.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We need to check.
Tom gave Mary a gun.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They went to the bus first.
Let's wait until Monday.
Anybody here knows them?
There must be a mistake here.
He can't afford a vacation.
I'm used to the smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was the day?
It's your fault.
I told you what time to come.
Of course, I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to the case.
Tom was sitting on the stairs.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes the lightning beats twice in one place.
I'm not bragging.
Leave it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door unlocked.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
You make your own decision.
Did you be surprised?
We counted the annual rings on the tree we cut, and we figured that he was thirty years old.
I think I know you all my life.
I want Tom to never write to my daughter again.
The rabbits are rapidly multiplying.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
What's the cost of the coat cleaning?
We'll paint it.
The opening is narrow.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When happiness knocks on your door.
You need to listen to her.
I wish you knew how much you mean to me.
Mary answered the teacher's question.
Tell me frankly.
I'll come to whatever it is.
Do you mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I don't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left the last one.
Tom signed a petition.
You tried to talk to Tom about it?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know much about Tom.
How was the day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
Would you like them to help?
Tom's not seen anywhere.
I told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruits.
Could you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
In the near future, we can meet again.
The trees calmed me down.
He's a bad guy.
I slept on my stomach.
Let me know.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she'd buy it.
I made breakfast.
