Peter Czech: A passage for the last minute?
It's all possible.
Today is the last day when you can jump through the transmission window and make a big breakdown.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Peter Czech, currently the Chelsea Deputy Branch, but now he's not sitting over a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He's sitting in a smiling NH Hotel, speaking to Czech journalists and preparing with the Czech representation at the game generator with the Americans and then to a sharp start of qualification on Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea's season, Premier League receives the advantage of Thibaut Courtois, the Czech first time in ten years in the London Club has reached a substitute.
A time ago, it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in Czech.
The one in the introduction of the season lost the Spanish Super cup in the fights with the Athletic and didn't even get into the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
Paris SG was also speculated.
The French League season took two wins and two remises, shot St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively, the shoe club AS Monaco is the most pushing.
He's got a balance of 1-1-2 in the league yet, and he broke up with Lille a slightly 1:1 on the weekend.
On the bullvarn English website today, the news was that Chech could want in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers but the Czech departure from Chelsea is not too likely for the last minute.
Skybet wrote a course 4:1 on him.
Peter, is it possible that you'll change your coat for the last few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never anything 100% in football.
Maybe there's a offer that won't be rejected during the day.
What would such a offer look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I still don't know how a offer that can't be rejected looks.
It would have to happen to the coincidence of all parties, especially if Chelsea had been dealing with or not.
Is it technically possible to do such an offence when you're now in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary to sign a new contract somewhere in the new office?
I didn't think about it that way.
But in this situation, there are a lot of players today, everyone is somewhere at the representative meetings, and surely a lot of offences will be closed today.
So it would be somewhat realistic.
How many clubs can afford you on the planet?
Well, I don't really know.
So you're not pushing away?
The situation in the first three matches of the new season is new for me after 15 years of career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack and leave.
I want to continue this fight about the position of the Chelsea Branch and he's on the coach whom he chooses to make decisions over the next weeks.
What role does your family play in your decision?
I take into account all the factors.
It is essential for me, of course, a sports perspective, but I look at it from the personal pages that, of course, belong to the needs of the family.
Is it possible you'd catch for another club in England?
That's the question I thought it would never be about me.
But in football, everything's possible.
I don't want to exclude anything.
I don't know the answer.

Renewing the very American ideal that employment rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a law to protect the commissions as civil law.
"In view of how the sites work, jobs for the high-class work work," says Ellison, a democratic senator for Minnesota, a co-Chairman of the Congress Committee.
That's why I'm so proud that I can introduce John Lewis's law that strengthens the position of employees together with the pattern of occasional rights.
This breakthrough legislation gives workers the same legal possibility as to defend discrimination in committees as in other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-commercial forces
Edit the Labour Relations Act so that it allows all employees to face discrimination if they want to join the committees, to be judged in a civil court - and to judge compensation or repayment of damage - is a proper and necessary initiative.
But it's not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other drafters in the law is to reinstat an American ideal.
Despite the union fights that took place in the recent years -- in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states -- the Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect job rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember when the country was promoting democracy, freedom of speech, press freedom and the right to gathering.
When the United States took over Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to accept the constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their commissions played a role in forming a new Japan, included the language in them and openly recognized that “the right of employees to gather together, collective negotiations and acts are guaranteed”.
When the United States took over Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged the Germans to create a constitution that ensures that the fascism of Adolph Hitler will be replaced by strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, so they included a clause that openly states: “The right to create communities that will ensure and improve working and economic conditions to each individual and to each call or profession will be guaranteed.
The arrangements that will restrict or pursue its injury will be repealed. The measures leading to the fulfilment of this purpose are illegal.
When the former Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission for Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the proposals and the Roosevelt guarantee included that “each one has the right to create and enter committees within its interests”.
The Americans of the entire generation have accepted the basic premium that employment rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create work unions - and their participation in collective negotiations with companies and government agencies in an equal partner position - must be protected.
Now, when these rights are attacked in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the unions did not reduce the power of the nation but extended it.
Increased the life standards of millions, created a market for industry and production, raised to an uncertain level.
Those who attack the unions, these simple truths forget, but history remembers them.
It doesn't forget history, and we shouldn't have.
The formal recognition of employment rights as humans - and the enlargement of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of unions - has a great delay.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that raised America and made her a real promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked the law that could close all the abortion clinics in Louisiana.
The Federal Judge temporarily blocked the Louisian law on Sunday, which, according to lawyers, would probably close all five clinics of abortion in the state.
The regulation legally signed by Louisian Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is to enter into force on 1 September, requires that doctors carrying out abortions take the right to accept a patient in a hospital from 30 miles from the performance of their practice.
The Judge's resolution means that doctors may temporaryly continue to carry out legal abortions and, in the meantime, must provide for this authorisation.
"The Proposing Party will be able to legally operate its activities and, at the same time, receives permission," states the Federal Judge John deGravelles in the resolution.
The hearing will be planned within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Activists for the right to abortion of a resolution, which was the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and told the doctors that he would give more time to obtain permission.
"Today's decision guarantees women in Louisiana that they will be safe against the infamous law to lose their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, the President and the Executive Director of the Reproductive Rights Centre, which in the name of the three of the five clinics was in charge of the blocking of the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decisions relating to both doctors from two clinics not among the prosecutors, and they also request that this authorisation be granted.
Louisiana is among the eleven countries that approved similar laws, while the courts in Alabama and Mississippi declared such measures as constitutional provisions.
The key parts of the Texas law that would close most of the remaining clinic in the state blocked the federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to abortion, together with the Association of American birth and gynekologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this authorisation is to put the doctor's requirements which are not necessary in medical terms.
The opponents of abortions opposed the measures to protect the health of women and some also welcomed the fact that the clinic would be closed for measures.
The Centre for Reproductive Rights stated that only one abortion doctor has a permit in Louisiana.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop abortion, this doctor would also cease to perform abortions because of fear of his safety, said the group.
The Louisian authorities in response indicated that they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while waiting for a request for the grant of rights.
Late diagnosis and disadvantage of treatment kills in rural cancer of eggs more frequently
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video with the hold of their dead mother who died of the cancer of eggs in 2007.
In women in the Australian village, more risks are to die of cancer of eggs than in their retails in the city.
Researchers analysed the medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosticated in 2005 with egg cancer and found that only 35% of 5 years after diagnosis lived.
The leading research of Susan Jordan from the Institute for Medicine Medical Research of QIMR Berghofer stated that about twenty percent more likely for women in rural and distant areas of the state to die in the course of the study than in women in urban areas.
STUDIES: New medicines can slow down lung cancer and egg cancer
Women’s researchers were watching during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chance of survival affected the age of women during diagnosis, the type of cancer of eggs, other existing diseases and the social-economic status.
The lowest survival occurred in elderly women with cancer diagnosticated in advanced stages.
For women in rural and distant areas, about 20 percent more likely to die in the course of the study than in women in urban areas.
Although studies were not designed to determine why women outside the city were more likely to die of egg cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors could be late diagnosis and bad availability of treatment.
"The sickness is best treated by gynecoonkologists who usually live in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of medical services on the distance to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen the transport service that will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and the support programmes for people who are being treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that long-term survival of women with cancer of eggs is low regardless of the geographical position, emphasizing the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
The research financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today.
In March 2012, when Elisha Neave was 33 years old, she was diagnosed with aggressive form of egg cancer.
Garden centres regret the reduction in the number of household owners
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline in the abundance of household owners under 35 years could lead to the loss of 10 million pounds per year until today’s young consumer generation reaches “the main age group of gardeners”, the garden centres will lose up to 10 million pounds per year.
According to the report, people who rent accommodation for their gardens will spend an average of 55% of the amounts that people living in their own.
As other factors threatening the sector that produces estimates of five billion pounds a year, the increase in the number of people living in very urban areas where there are no gardens, the familiarity of proliferation places used as a parking area and the size of gardens.
In the area of Great London, where the share of households declined from 61% to 43% during six years, the household is one of the lowest expenditures on garden products in Britain.
The HTA and the Royal Garden Society stated that living in a loan or lack of space does not mean that humans could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief garden advisor for RHS, said: “The natives have a very favorite growing plants in flowers - when they move, plants can take with them. ”
The HTA report revealed that the “gear of gold” of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and resulted in a higher share of household owners and economic prosperity lasting from 80 to half of the 1990s.
He also foretold a higher reconstruction for this year by a better weather arriving under the adverse conditions in March and April.
When the eastern dictator preaches democracy.
After Putin, at the meeting of his youth organization, who reminds me of Hitlerjugend, baptized with nuclear weapons and in fact showed to all that his views were stolen, he gave us today a talk about democracy.
But I feel like the current regime in Russia shows many characteristics of the fascist state.
The great nations have one common thing, which is that they can be managed by both the opposed nationalism, even that the complex of minority can transform into imperiality.
The time goes east, apparently different than the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of wars for overcome over Europe has long gone, the east thinks they have been overlooked for a long time and need to regain their international position.
Such mood and frustration ruled in Germany in the 1930s, just before the power of the Nazi, and then the explosion of nationalism was unlike today in Russia.
And then the total similar cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that's probably quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and most Russians probably missed the time Russia ruled half the world and the second part was shaking before them.
Perhaps the Western politicians blame it themselves, maybe a little Vladimir cryed on their shoulder, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted and maybe they started underestimating him and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He's done a good thing at home, he looked like he didn't even want to go anywhere, and he slipped the knives at home.
Now he decided to retrieve his lost position.
He's starting slowly, he's got time.
He's probably a leader for life, so he'd be in a hurry.
He screwed the Kavkazans, now he's gonna screw up the Ukrainians, then there's a bunch of rabbits from the Balt.
You've been screwing a Russian bear in your skin for a long time.
It will be noticed by China, which is somehow scattering and definitely scattering on the far east.
And the Germans of Vladimir also are pretty angry as they're doing well, and I gave it to their ass at 45 and to their ass.
How about a new Novorosy in Karl Wars?
That would be the base, and there's a lot of ours, and how they'd be oppressed there, and they'd already want to break the leckter.
Our veterans will still remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Well, here's their Prime Minister Sobotka, that's so soft, can be slammed like a nail and eat all of their EU.
That'd play so much for the big Russia.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And as an explosion, we'll use our neighbours who live in their territory.
There's plenty of Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed there, they're just pushing them out there and we're not leaving them alone, we're gonna protect them.
And again, the Russian will rule, because he's born for something else.
Europe, however, is only good as a pretext that proud Ivan can dance a goat.
Turkey called for an American diplomat for a spy report
Turkish Foreign Minister called for the highest built US diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British spy activities in Turkey.
The Deputy President of the Government, Bulent, said that the US charges d'affaires and Turkish officials were dealing with the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to the documents provided by the former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was the priority objective of American and British reporting services.
According to Turkish communications, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was batalised by the importance of the report and declared that all important countries are watching each other.
The older report, according to which the German Rapporteur Service also focused on Ankara, caused a more distressed response to the Turkish government.

Chief of Police in Magaluf accused of corruption
The complainants presented evidence to the Office of the Mallorian State Prosecutor on Friday on the extortion of police officers and state officials of the board in Calvia's self-government area.
The Chief of the Police in Calvia on the vacation island of Mallorca was arrested after the charges of the entrepreneurs and the owners of bars in an inappropriately famous party quarter in Magaluf.
High Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into an investigation detention after he was accused of corruption by several businesses from Punta Ballena, a street in which most bars and night businesses are located in Magaluf.
According to Mallorca Diario's Internet journal, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and government officials in the Calvia self-government area on Friday to the prosecutor of the Mallorian Office.
Two other local police have been arrested by the Spanish State Police for connection with corruption charges and together with Navarr will hear them.
The Spanish National Journal of ABC quoted the unsatisfactory owners of night businesses which have serious impacts on the public factors on their business.
"It's not about making money, it's about survival," a businessman said in the court.
Don't play with our life.
We don't have anything to lose.
Magaluf came to the main pages of magazines around the world after a video of 18-year-old British tourists showed oral sex to 24 men during the tour of bars.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to supervise the drunks and cructures in a number of vacation parties in Magaful by reducing the number of unfamiliar alcohol tours after bars.
Furthermore, the Playhouse Club, where an oral sex was provided, was forced to close for a year and together with the organizers of tournament at Carnage bars to pay the penalty of 55,000 euros (73,000 dollars).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is mostly popular in the British, was also witnessed by many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including fashion waves known as “balconing ”, where people jump from one balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
First spring day marked by rain and storms that had an impact on the flight at the airport in Adelaide
The spring brought south of South Australia an ice surprise, with a strong rain and a strong wind that seriously affected the airport in Adelaide.
The next 5 mm collisions in the city will fall until 9:00 a.m. and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night of Sunday.
The last rain was presented together with several short strokes associated with the storm and wind strikes that started at eight o'clock at night and during about ten minutes, almost 4 mm collapse.
After the winter last week, several early spring doses dropped on Monday to just 15.8 °C.
It is considered that the storm weather contributed to the late arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was to land a moment after 19:30, at a short distance, but it was affected by a change in the speed or direction of the wind and was forced to defer landing.
The wind strikes at the Adelaide airport at that time reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground.
The flight data showed that the plane had to drop off since the second landing and finally reached about 20:40.
The delay of the plane resulted in the delay of other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to the predictions, at Tuesday the temperature of Adelaide at maximum 16 °C may occur one or two precautions.
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the region near the Gaza zone returned to school on Monday after they spent summer in bomb covers, while during the 50th day war between Israel and Hamas attacked their homes with missiles and minomets. However, the schools in Gaza remain closed while the territories are restored from fights.
The beginning of the school brought in communities in South Israel the attacks of joy and excitement, but the battle marks are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the employees of a rocket hit, removed the residues from the walls and slowly anticipated the return of children.
"We are a little scared, but we are looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, the inhabitant of Kibucu Saad and English teacher at local school.
Many children in this area really need to return to everyday routine.
Her 11 - year - old daughter Shani Bart said that “it is a little strange ” to go back to school at once.
"We've had a few difficult times and we haven't even left the house," she said.
Kibuc, near the border with Gaza, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer its support to the population.
Until the fire stopped last week, thousands of people of the border settlements such as Saad stayed inside their homes or their homes left and went to the safer areas away from Gaza to escape missiles and minometers.
Many inhabitants of Nachal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza, in which the shooting from the Palestinian minomet killed a four-year-old boy with hesitation return.
The Minister of Education stated that about twelve families still haven't returned.
Their children were temporaryly placed into replacement schools.
The President of the government, Benjamin Netanjahu, visited the school in Sderota, a city on the border with Gaza, which was severely hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged children to study thoroughly, and he added: “We will provide you with education and security. ”
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday for unlimited peace.
While the ceasefire led to an immediate end of the fight, it did not solve the key problems as the requirement of Hamas to terminate the Israeli-Egyptic Gaza blockade and reopen airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel requires the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers falling in war.
The new circle of indirect proceedings is expected to begin later in this month in Egypt.
According to the estimates of the Palestinians and the United Nations in the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians, of which three quarters were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel doubts and estimates that at least half of the killed were radicals, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
On the side of Israel, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died.
Hamas and other Gaza radicals fired during the battles on the city of Israel mainly in the south of the country 4,591 missiles and shots from minometers.
The Israeli army again took over 5,000 air attacks and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and estimated 250 000 people hid in a hundred United Nations schools that turned into a commission shelter.
Thousands of thousands of people still staying in hiding, and lasting fights have been delayed by school officials last week.
"I hope that they will soon open the school so that we can complete education as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, 13-year-old boy from school in the largest city of Gaza.
The verge at the meeting: I'm behind you.
And Lafatha suffers from the temperature.
The Czech football team met before the middle preparatory struggle with the United States today in Prague, and the subsequent qualification of Europe's qualifications against the Netherlands.
Of the thirty-fifth cocktail, the spartian attacker David Lafat, who is suffering from the temperature.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David probably has some problems.
But we want him to be here and be fine as soon as possible," Coach Paul Vrba said to the journalists.
"If it's two or three days, or it's fit tomorrow, it will be seen according to his health condition that our doctor decides," he added.
Other players are fine.
"Certainly someone has some pain, but it's not that they can't train or take part in a game in the middle of the United States," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday night, Verba called as the last player of the sports booker Lukas Vachu.
He admitted that it was not a easy decision, but also other mediumpolars.
I decided on the basis that Luke is a perspective player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very complicated, but I am behind it," Vrba said to You.
What about Schural?
Let's see what happens to Latata.
It is not excluded that the nomination could still be changed in the case of health problems.
For example, on the weekend, the liberian Joseph Schural, who gave the hattrick, was glowing with great performance.
Of course, there are players who show the form lately.
Let's see how David Lafata is going to do it.
If there is no way to be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot donominate any of the players who have engaged in the Czech liaison," said Vrba.
This afternoon awaits the training representation in Strahova, then a classic pre-paid training on Tuesday before duel with the U.S. to Summer, which will be open for fans and followed by the autograph.
The struggle with the Americans is played on Wednesday 20:15 and the national team will seek to win the Prime Victory under Verba.
In the previous three preparatory matches, he played two remedies and once lost.
The qualification fight with the Netherlands is then on 9 September from 20:45.
Walking on the Netherlands to Italy
The verba loves to have more time for training, unlike previous dates.
It's a advantage when you have players eight days and you can exercise with them certain things that we may have never had so much time before.
Now we will only be able to focus on preparing for the Netherlands as best as possible," Werba praised.
The Netherlands will present themselves before the fight in Prague on Thursday in Italy and the duel will personally monitor the former temporary representative trainer Joseph Pesica.
He'll give us the information that's from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have a game and we're gonna have to discuss it.
The new coach will come to the Netherlands, and we will see what changes there will be," said the Bronze Medalists from the recent World Championship.
According to very monitored statistics, the prices of apartments in the winter period have increased the most in the past seven years.
According to the apartment value index in the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic increased in August by 1.1%, the Agency reported on Monday.
The increase led to a total increase in June, July and August 4,2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices increased to 10,9 %, more than twice per year until August 2013, but the profit was not equally distributed in the country.
The RP Research Manager Data Tim Lawless stated that Sydney and Melbourne are running on the market.
The RP Data numbers show that the apartment prices in Sydney last year increased by 16,1 %, while Melbourne prices were 11,7 %.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price increases in the average between five and six percent.
On the other hand, the Canberra was located, which was damaged by the State of ordered cost reduction and where prices increased only by 1.4 % during the year.
Lawless said that, when spring started, the number of properties for sale will be increased in the next months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“In view of the continuing high sales rate, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, the value of living is likely to be increased in the next three months," he said.
My father never took me.
He never said to me "I love you."
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaiian immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
He and his father, who died when Henry was 19, who worked at the factory, had a colder relationship.
Henry is testing the comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and which is part of the Radio series 4.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rape and the melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with several unpleasant memories from his childhood.
After his mother's death, Henry went through a “depth ” therapy, and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew a lot about him.
You have never seen his face, but you have heard his voice: “Stop the rumor.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a kid, they were adults - walked with him to the bar and discussed things like a shape of a beer or a beauty of a cricket hit.
I've never spoken to him like this.
Most of my life was a serious guy in the corner reading the papers.
Henry recently visited Dudley’s shop, and even though the conditions were better than in his father’s day, he looked at what life had to be for him.
Today there's a little more light, but it's still dark, smoked, clouded labyrint, where the flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and sasie.
Dad always got into the van and he was just lying there, and then he was hearing how slowly he started singing for himself, because he was washing the store.
When I walked around, I realized that he was doing this for years to live his family, and I started to appreciate him more.
Still, Henry experienced childhood without parental love.
Daddy didn't take anyone, he said, "I love you."
When my mom was sick and dying, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, who was with Dawn French, allowed him to experience love that he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With France, who was married for 25 years, there are still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot of, a lot of weight and the symptoms of diabetes began to show, the doctor told me: “You have to make a radical change. ”
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I also had to hold a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And tired.
No one wants to eat the carrot alone.
Change in the direction of taking Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, shortly cut chin.
After he got his recognition from the criticism of his Othello, he flooded into the theater.
Followed the comedie full of mistakes and the Plates of August Wilson.
It's a different experience than sitcomys and comedies that filled his habitat work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him on the stage of paroding someone, and wrote about him in a talented New Faces competition.
His television career began in the mid - 70 ’ s: “I have been the only black imitator/comic in TV for a long time. ”
He was learning for a walk.
Besides the fact that the public had to notice me, I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how to make fun of jokes, to be a star and to play on TV, and that was really difficult.

Since his manager owned the right to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a fun program in which the actors were dressed as blacks, Henry eventually performed his comedy for five years.
That's why my family wasn't all right.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “years and years of appreciation for the main product of British TV, ” but was also“ the grotesque parody of black people. ”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedial circles and represented figures that at the same time confused and celebrated the British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry show began to be transmitted in 1984 and in the 1990s he was, among other things, known as Chief Gareth Blacklock in a comedial series Chef!.
Next decades, he took advertising, documents, TV series and roles in movies, but after sending his series LennyHenry.tv to BBC in 2008, he said, "What are you going to do now, Len, because it seems like you're stuck in one place or you're a little off the road."
Next was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
First was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't learn him well at school, and I thought it was something for a white high school.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed in the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't dare when you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented 20 lines from Othel's final speech for the document, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gives me the courage.
It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn text, find out something about it.
So the test was hard, and before I read this game for months and months.
And it was a success.
It seemed like they were waiting for trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in the Commedia full of mistakes.
Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical disturbance and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for taking the audience.
“The sound in my head told me, ‘Before the computer fixes, you must entertain them now ten minutes.’’
Instead, the theatre director announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene and something in me said, "Hm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plots in Duchess Theatre
Learn the text of the Plots was a challenge.
The panic is pretty good, it's making it strong.
The game was also accepted well, so it is like a sign of God saying: “This is what you should do. ”
Of course he says it in a sound voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really like it.
I'm enjoying the testing room.
Still, Henry remains the brain of the comedian - all the time our conversation interrupts with humorous performances when he enters and comes out of the role of the imitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups, because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I think.
If you're still looking for something, you can get into a blind street.
Sometimes, when I want, I do Live at the Apollo, but I'm not happy as before.
I asked if he'd ever organize a stand-up tour.
It's a joy to sit in a room with a director who's helping to give the lines of the beginning, the media and the end of the road - I don't think I ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm enjoying the actress.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public officials to highlight the absence of employees
Kenya began with the biometrical registration of all its state officials to try to remove from the payment of the government's missing employees.
According to the government's statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will receive payments.
The government believes that thousands of people receive payments even after they left the state service.
Once he took the office in 2013, President Uhur Kenyatt promised that he would avoid corruption in the public administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the State loses at least one million dollars (700 000 pounds) on payments from non-existing employees and on the next abuse of official power.
The government is suspected that payments are continued to be placed on bank accounts even after the death of the employee or after the employee leaves, the BBC reporter from the capital of Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri, stated.
All officials shall be transferred to the identification centres for the next two weeks where their data will be biometricly recorded, the government shall be stated in the statement.
Furthermore, he says that all those who do not apologize without sufficient apology will be expelled from the payment sheet.
“As a real public service employee, this measure will significantly contribute to its improvement and will also be used to clean up the payments of both governments and thus solve the problem of the non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish cops are arrested for "speaking" against the government
The local media states that in Turkey, the suspects of “government against the government” were detained for a total of 33 police officers.
The police office has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 highly built officials were detained.
Some of them were involved in December's corruption investigation, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for alleged organizing a criminal gang and telephone hearing.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (the President of the Government at that time) identified their negotiations as part of the impact of the Islamic Spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all the children in Ukraine returned to school
Most schools in Ukraine were reopened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, the President of the Government, Arsenium Jaceňuk, took his daughter to school.
At this occasion, he told the present journalists that not all schools were opened again, but that it was determined to defend the country for the next generations:
Not in all schools, a traditional ceremony has been made on September 1st.
No, there's peace all over Ukraine.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, has to fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slovenia, who visited Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful in their future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the children wearing their shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, maybe BBC found the boss for difficult times.
It brings with it a cloud of glory from the world of banking, media management and internal conclave of the conservative party.
She's got experience from the front lines.
The career started in the Bain and Co consultant company, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media world.
Seven years she was the Executive Director of Finance Times. She resigned her function when the highest function in Pearson's mother's company was employed by her younger colleague.
Its departure was said to be nearing a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also wide.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former Director of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became a government advisor.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the work of the director as a poison potassium.
Not only is BBC a large and complicated entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inside the top layer of its own leadership of BBC, but also out to the public's voice in the days of no calm when things do not work.
It is a nearly unsustainable monopoly that requires thorough reform.
Which director, however, would risk coming to a company complicated as a Chinese dynasty, putting it down and losing his own job.
It's a difficult challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, many people would like to see BBC reducing -- its power, its finances -- and how it's revised her status.
As the competitive and new technologies are enlarged, it brings with them immediate negotiations on concessionary fees to the BBC great danger.
For a small amount of 145,50 pounds a year, the British public buys a share in something that is definitely the largest media company in the world.
BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, and each is only 40 pens per day.
Furthermore, the BBC familiarity is obviously increasing: 53% of the favourites compared to 31% of the years ago.
Models of use of BBC services have changed: Today, the news titles are showing me on my mobile phone and on the series I missed, I can look at iPlayer.
But BBC still remains a very loved and amazing institution.
He needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims that the insulting tweet did not approve
Tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas governor Rick Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained an insulting picture of a democratic state representative who initiated Perry's criminal charges for abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was published on Perry's account that was distant from the previous.
The tweet left my account, which was not authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet, and I pulled it," he said in the next post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is in fact responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published an unpleasant, humorous picture of the state representative of Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, which was convicted in April 2013 for drunken management.
When she refused to resign, Perry rejected the payment of funds for her office, which Perry, a possible candidate for the president in 2016 elections, brought this month before the great jury in Austin.
The Tweet quote stated: “I don't always drive with three times higher levels of alcohol in the blood than the limit allowed... but if I do, I'll sue Governor Perry that he calls me on responsibility for this. ”
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not Lehmberg's office.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and he called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified Legal Team asked the judge to refuse the charge, because the use of laws for the most long-term prosecution of the governor in Texas history is constitutional.
Perry interrupted the payment of $7.5 million from the State Fund for the Protection of Public Interest, which has a seat in Travis County and pursues corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection caused a formal complaint by a left-oriented civilian activist group.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it's celebrated.
After he ended up in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012 at the fifth place in the committee of his party, Perry answered his speculation that he could already end up by tweeting his own photo running near the lake and saying: "I am here, South Caroline!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to normal.
One of the most prominent London developers' companies warned that the residence market in southeastern England was "return" to the normal level of activity.
Housing in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices and the widespread concerns of the credit bubble caused in June the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the Berkeley Company for difficult clients, said on Monday: “From the beginning of the current financial year, the market from the top point in 2013 returned to normal transactions.”
During the decline, the London Housing Market was well flooded into the capital of abroad.
According to the catastrophic authorities only last year, the prices in the city elevated by 18,5%, making the average of 6.7% in England and throughout Wales.
The average sales prices of the private, price-available and student apartment from Berkeley rose about a fifth last year and at the end of April rise to 423,000 pounds.
However, in the last months for foreign customers of London real estate are not so attractive - some of them also threatened the introduction of new taxes from real estate and the discussion of possible "community taxes" with which the politicians came before the parliamentary elections of May next.
The London Real Establishment Office of Foxtons last week warned that the April review of the mortgage market, which presented stricter loans rules, will also slow down the market growth rate in sales and prices during the second half of the year.
The new data of the Bank of England on Monday showed a decrease in the number of approved mortgages per month in July, which suggests that the residence market is calming.
Hamptons International, another real estate office, decreased on the basis of that the prices of homes have already fallen, its predictions for the growth of London real estate prices for 2015 to 3%.
The volume of transactions according to the WA Ellis reality office, meanwhile, in London's most expensive quarters such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington decreased by a quarter every year.
Nevertheless, the demand for residence in the capital of Berkeley was a blessing because it increased cash for forward sale to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-seeming living in a good place remained the same, and thus the forward sale was maintained. ”
In June, the company announced that, from the beginning of the year to the end of April, it sold 3 742 properties, almost a third more than before the summit of the crisis in 2007.
The annual tax profit increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday, before Pidgley's annual meeting, he said it was predicted that Berkeley's annual remuneration would be in line with current market expectations.
Analytics agree that the annual profit before taxation will be 450 million pounds.
The Berkeley shares stopped at the London Bureau on 23.96 pounds afternoon.
Hacker published photos naked by Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence is arriving at 85th Academy Price.
The photos of Oscara Jennifer Lawrenc fled on the Internet because of the hacker who claimed that he had a "list" of photos of hundreds of other starting actress.
The speaker of the films "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were true and he criticized the hacker for "the obvious disturbance of privacy".
The officials have already been contacted and will pursue anyone who's stolen photos Jennifer Lawrence's release.
Hacker photos that were originally published on the 4chan image sharing server, reportedly obtained by a space in the Internet storage system Applu iCloud. The alleged list of the photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is not clear how many photos are authentic, however the star of the film “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world” Winstead also criticised the act on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who are looking at the photos that my husband and I have made in private home years ago are satisfied with each other," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known as Nickolodeon 'iCarly' and 'Victorious', denied that the photos would be true. On Twitter she told: 'This is my alleged naked photos'.
It's better to cut it even in distress.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that the pop star speaker Ariana Grande denyed that alleged photographs would be true.
An extraordinary illustration from the praised new novel of Howard Jacobson about love and letter “J”
They broke up, that's the best way to describe it, they gradually distributed like a carton box that someone left on the rain.
Just from time to time, a woman told him that he was too serious, complicated, hard, isolated and maybe a little poor.
And then she shake his hand.
He admitted it.
He's been good at screwing like a jerk, yes.
The last victim of his ability was the starting loving bowl, which more than usually promised to relieve him from lonely life boring and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild hair heat and a flying heart from a village in the northern island, which was even more far and undeserved than Port Reuben.
On the southern, she came with an elder associate that Kevern thought she was her aunt who inherited the property in a wet but beautiful valley called, conveniently, the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for a few years.
The pipes procured, the dead spiders in the vans, the slippers signed their slippery on the windows, as if they thought they belonged to them, the garden was grown and the grass was like a huge head of grain.
The house seemed like a bachelor of children's stories, scary and also charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations on Man Booker Prize 2014.
The longer choice will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting in a long grass chair and holding hands, enjoying unexpected warm spring afternoon, unexpectedly set up a public station that supplied the country with comfortable music and comforting news, when in the view of her burned cross legs, he reminded him of the old song of a long-forgotten black comic, who was pleased to listen to his father with the rolled rolls.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggression, they have not played such songs in radios.
They weren't forbidden -- really banned was nothing -- they just didn't play.
They helped them get into desuetuda, just as the same word desuetudo itself.
The human taste has proved what the laws and positions of outside the law would never be able to do, and as people relating to books, they choose memoaries where the poor one becomes a rich cook, cook and love romans, both the music chooses ballades.
The cavern was letting him squeeze the day and started playing the imaginary piano and a rough, comic voice singing the serenade of Aillin's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was the favorite song from the jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to push the letter j before he got out of his mouth.
It started like a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he played the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't too funny that time, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew he was expected, that was all.
He must have explained what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard of any.
Not a jazz, even though he wasn't directly built outside the law, they didn't play.
Improvement came out of fashion.
There was only a place in life for one “if. ”
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where she ends.
Same in humor.
His unpredictableness went to people's nerves.
And the jazz was a humour expressed by the song.
Although he hadn't heard of Sammy Davis Junior in ten years, he knew Kevern jazz from his father's polotajal collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember the time the favorite singers were not black.
Also without laws or pressure.
The lofty company is the kind in which each part of it with gratitude - with the appreciation of those who were happy accidental savings - agrees with the principle of group appreciation.
The people of the Afro-Caribian origin used the temperament and the constitution for entertainment and athletic, so they sang and run.
People from the Indian subcontinent, like the nature of the gift for electronics, have taken responsibility for not having a family without a functional phone.
The Polaci who remained were the installers, the Greeks who remained washed the dishes.
Those from the countries of the Persian Gulf and Levant whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country, while it was what happened, WHAT HAD HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE BEEN BEEN THOUGHT TO WHEN THEY WHEN THEY WHEN THERE HAVE HAVE HAVE BEEN BEEN ABOUT TO ATTACHED TO THE FAIL, WHEN THEY WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE FAIL, WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WAS BE ABOUT OF THE FAME, WHAT THE FAILD THE FAILD OF THE FAILS, WHICH THE LAGGHDDDDDDERS BE BEDED THE THE WATER OF THE LAGHT OF THE LAWS, WATT, WATKED, WATKED THE THE TH THE THE TH THE HADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD THE THE THE , THE THE BE, THE BE, THE HADDLE, BE HADDDDDDDD THE BE BE BE BE BE BE BE BEDDDDDDDDGING, BE BE BE BE BE BE BE BEDGING, THE BEDGING BE BEDGING, THE BE BEDGING BE BE BE BE BE BE BE IN THE BEDDDDGING THE BE IN THE BE IN THE BE IN THE BE IN THE THE THE BE IN THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE
Everyone according to his talent.
Since she was listening only to ballades, Ailinn had hardly understood how the messful words that Kavern just sang to her could produce music.
Music was the expression of love.
"In fact, they are not disgusting," said Kevern.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he liked this song.
He talked too much, but the negligible garden provided the illusion of security.
Aside from the sound sheets, no word could escape.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was struggling to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"She seemed funny to him," he finally said.
She shook her head unbelievably and shadowed the view of Kevern.
There was nothing else to see all over the world but the snail of her crown hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"When you think," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Maybe a bit of ankles...
Are you saying you hate me because I have too thick ankles?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too soon for it.
"Your fat cords are just attracting me," he tried.
I'm kind of freaked.
That didn't happen.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often brought him into trouble, because, like his father, he missed the spell needed to conquer the cruelty that was cheating in the jokes.
Maybe his father was deliberately cruel.
Maybe Cavern was deliberately cruel.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons was red and lifted out of the bed, dropped the radio and spilled infection wine.
It's no wines, so it couldn't be drinking for it.
She seemed to be shaking in her distress like palm leaves in the storm.
"I'm insanely attracted to being a fool," she said...
Except that it doesn't attract me.
He regretted her, both because of his disgraceful words and the fear she had in her eyes at the time she stood against him.
Did she think she'd hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn't doubt that it was the same way it was here.
The same broad and ice ocean was squeezing about them.
The same confused men, after what has become, even more intimidating and cruel than their ancestors, the smugglers and the smugglers, wandered angry from the bedroom to the bedroom, ready to raise their hand on any woman who would dare to refuse or laugh at them.
Bullshit?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their hands!
First to pomaza her - to be anointed has become the most common expression for erotic irritation between man and woman: antibodies of faint ballads of love that radio swimmed - first they pombrished her, then one slaughter.
According to Kevern's view, too much cultivation, because the massage itself was a act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons never told him to leave.
He lifted out of his bed like an old man.
She felt angry herself, but the difficulty of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know each other.
She was watching him leave -- as if she was watching him from the window on the floor -- a man who was caught, what caused himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was opened for him and for all men generally, regardless of her being beaten by a few.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders hanged, embarrassed, defeated, all the battle left him - why did she seem to know this look well, even though she couldn't think of the only moment today, that she would ever see it again?
Ailinn Solomons, again alone, looked at her legs.
About 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, intelligent and excited 20-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, the non-statural public mood monitoring system, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and medium-term violent acts in the areas of the country where its mitigation or direct stopping, the most expected if enough money and energy had been emerged to be removed.
“It has been done a lot and a lot of things have to be done,” she wrote, “to calm down the inherent aggression of people who fought in many battles and most of them won, especially in the dried, hardly available places of the country, where, despite the top of the church towers arriving over the living fences of human kindness, it was rarely discovered.”
Some things, however, are unreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the pudes.
Inhabitants sigh over sentimental ballades, swallow unfortunate stories and declare that they strongly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that old brutality is maintained as hard as in urban aglomerations, but evidence also shows that at home, at workplaces, roads, and even at sports fields there is a new and attacking hatred.
"Unfortunately, you have a tendency to be too major," said her supervisor.
I'd suggest you read less romans.
Esme Nussbaum had her head down.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I feel I don't have to answer this," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Esme regained its right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
“I am not asking,” Rabinovitz finally said, “that I should have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudices on this workplace.
We serve unconditioned companies.
But some kind of hypersensitivity, which is completely acceptable and praiseful about itself, may sometimes distinguish the judgment as you did.
Apparently, you yourself are predominant to the church - things that you call “grub” and“ brutal ” might also interpret as the expressions of natural power and energy.
Still dealing with what happened, if it happened, as if it happened, yesterday, preparing the country with its basic lifepower.
While Rabinovitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum was looking around.
His head on the light table rosely blinked the recommendation that Ofnow sent to the world for the last quarter or more.
Smile to your neighbors, take care of your partner, listen to ballades, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the singing word is better than written, but there's nothing better than love.
"I fully understand your reservations," she said silently, when she was sure her superior was over, "and I do not claim that the wound has not been healed as we think she's getting healed.
In particular, my concern is that if we are not noticed in advance, we will repeat the same error that led to what happened, if it happened.
But this time, we won't ventilate ourselves with anger and untrustedness.
Luther Rabinovitz connected the fingers.
That should have meant infinite patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if the steps they may have done and perhaps did not your grandparents, you describe as mistakes.
You are too far in talking about the ventilation of their “anger ” and“ uncertainty ” to the“ others. ”
I should not remind someone in your place that in understanding the past and the protection of the presence, we are not talking about "we" and "them".
There was no "we" and there were no "they."
All we know is that it was chaotic times.
"When we are honest with each other," Esma took the courage, "no one is guilty.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not what happened, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add to -- we're in this together.
And just as there is no guilt that can be tricked against someone, there are no things that should be fixed, even if correction is suitable and perhaps.
But what else is past than learning from it?
There's a past to forget about it.
If I can add something to that--
Luther Rabinovitz disconnected his fingers.
"I will take your message into account," he said and released it.
On the day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcycler who hired the trail in a way that the circuits described as “violent and angry. ”
The accidents happen.
The army of the Lesoth Kingdom claims that there is no plan - the president of the government remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Lessoth Kingdom denyed that they would organize a porch in order to remove the government, and claim that they acted against the police suspects of attempting to arm political fanaticians.
The President of the government Thomas Thabane fled the country and said the army surrounded his official seat and hired government buildings in Maseru's capital.
After he declared that he was threatened by death, the prime minister went with his family to the neighbouring South African Republic.
Major Ntlele Ntoi, speaker of the army, said that it was not actually a push, but the response of the army to the threat of the “political fanatics” that the police tried to arm.
"This morning, the command of the defense of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after receiving several reports of the information service that there were several groups in a number of police groups that planned to arm some radical, political fans who were going to make a trigger in the country," said the Voice of America.
The speaker of the South African government Clayson Monyela said the military action seemed to be an attempt to remove the government.
"Although no one has declared that he has taken government power through force, allegedly the actions of the Forest Defence Facility of State Return," he said.
The military representatives of the Lesoth Kingdom said that soldiers returned to their casar on Sunday and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane declared that according to his view, he was the target of the attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended the parliamentary meeting for internal disputes, he has been in Lesoth's tension.
He declared that, despite the opposite claims, he did not undermine his government's actions.
Production in the euro area is on 13-month minimum
The growth of production, according to a carefully monitored study in August, slowed to the minimum of 13 months.
The final shopping manager index in the euro area (PMI) of June 51.8 fell to 50.7.
Number exceeding 50 means an expansion.
There have been new orders and factories that have damaged the growing tension between the EU and Russia for Ukraine.
The numbers originate from the fourth meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
The markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the distant recovery of the euro area and the threat of deflation with inflation to 0.3%.
The speculation appeared that the ECB director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he considers the quantitative release of the euro area, similar to how the United Kingdom and the United States joined during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the brake effect that has a growing economy and the geopolitical uncertainty on the manufacturer is increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, the main Markit economy.
The production PMI of Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell on the 11-month minimum 51.4.
In the second largest zone economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
Concerning about France, Italy again crossed the stagnation.
The signs that the rushing force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands disappeared also are not too comfortable," Dobson said.
Industrial slowing is likely to bring oil into the fire of analysts expecting the implementation of other currency or tax stimulations.
One positive report came from the Irish Republic, where the PMI grew to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economist in IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing that can be done about the production review of shopping managers in August is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: Producers in the euro area currently have a very complex life because increasing geopolitical tension - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds to still difficult conditions in many countries even more uncertainty.
This increased uncertainty of trade has provenly affected - especially consumer confidence, which will likely cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially the cost-effective ones.
He stated that as “more likely” it appears that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative release, “although we expect it to be limited”.
Ten years of hell of survivors from Belslan: Ten years from the horrors of a busy school children are still suffering
Ten years ago, the Czech radicals in the school in Beslan in Southern Russia were held as hostage by thousands of people
During the suffering that took three days and which shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, of which more than half were children.
We returned to Beslane to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the wild school.
Precisely ten years after the scary school in Beslan, where 334 people, including 186 children, died, warned the survivors of the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, they captured and killed the fanatical terrorist children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
The opposition to the tragedy linked the east and the West, which led to action and the future in this disaster.
After ten years, we returned to Belslan in Southern Russia to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the wild school.
We found amazing young people who resisted the unfortunate, even though the memorial of the hell caused by terrorists in them will continue to live.
What is their greatest wish?
To make the war that now destroys Ukraine - and in which children like them die - already ended.
A girl trying to get back into a ruined schoolroom.
She was captured by the front Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, as only in the underwear she was trying to get back into the bombed schoolroom after the bomb exploded.
The confused Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, which is now forty.
The concerns were that both were dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," said Aida that time.
I had my legs from blood.
I got up and came back to find my mom.
She was saved by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she was well healed, but yesterday she said: “The pain came back three months ago.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to do another surgery.
My knee's got pieces of stroke left.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people as doctors help her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it definitely has not destroyed it," she said determinedly.
"I just had this happening and that can't change.
Once a year, I go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to friends about it.
That pain is too big.
My best friend and the future classmate of Jer Gapoeva was killed there.
When we were little, we played together and imagined how we would go to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she didn't forget about captivity, but memories are a little pale every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture on the Internet as I climb through the school window, I think a lot of people will see her for the first time, they understand the disaster and prevent her from repeating it.
A boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead.
It was his first school day (in Russia children start school in seven years) and he survived the class surrounding of the school in the hug of his mother Tamary.
At that time, a seven - year - old man said: “Mommy told me that if there was an explosion, I should lay down on the ground and hold her for her hand. ”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Get away."
He was afraid she was dead, running, and on his way he saw the crying patches, grabbed the baby's hand and ran a shower bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother was dead. ”
He says, “I couldn't save her. ”
In fact, Tamara went to freedom and lived in a hospital with a wounded leg and thought her son died.
After they met again, she said: “I cried fortunately.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London, according to the missing News of the World, where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie declared the winner of Bernardo's Children.
"The horror returns every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can say the memories are faded.
I remember that right after that I threw all my guns to play.
But today I can play computer games in which they're shooting, and I don't have a problem with it.
“I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the courtyard with whom they didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or they died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember a good trip to London, mostly how I could pick anything I wanted in the toy shop, and how I went with a cabriolet.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where the war suffers just as he and his friends suffered.
That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am terribly sorry for anyone who has to go through such a horror," Damir, who participated in volunteer activities in the monastery last week.
I want to help a lot.
I want to work with the police once, and I hope they'll take me to the Academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, there were no children who would scream and run here, and it took a few months of silence.
He remembers a live trip with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price paid and for the possibility of going on autumn 2004 to London.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her personally that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember the taste of Damir for the borszch, so they called all Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting them out of the water gun, and they run and play with him.
And it was just a month since that horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share with us our pain and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world has not changed to better in ten years.
Now, there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think it's been and it's gonna be killed by a lot of children.
They're the same kids as you are ours.
I think for many people there's just a war in news that they listen to when they're bored or doing something else.
I know what these people experience, what a horror it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice and quiet boy, he's not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about it at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates, and sometimes he goes to the gym and burns candles there.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember he used to lie on a couch with a face that was distracted from us and sometimes lying for hours.
He didn't sleep, he had eyes open.
And I remember he threw all his guns or other guns to play.
I can't believe that I've been sure for a few hours that he's dead and I'll never see him again.
When after the explosion, I got up on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, the pieces of human bodies lived everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my boy didn't have this hell of a chance to survive.
"I remember yelling: 'Damire, run, run!' but I was convinced that he didn't hear me.
But he heard her and he ran away.
So our lives are going to be different from others.
Gregory Ilyin, 17
A boy whose photograph taken after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Comfort: survivors from Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Gregorius today
When he fled for his life after the Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, his bloody face was frightened.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of beslane beast.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, put him down at school first day and hurried to take his older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before terrorists hit the court, so my boy stayed alone for three days," she recalled.
Not completely alone because we had relatives there, but everyone died there.
Only my Gregory survived.
As the date is approaching, it's still harder to think about it and talk about it.
It won't take a single day to remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Photo Grigoria (left) was one of the most shocking paintings of the attack and was grown as a statue (right)
I remember the day Gregory was looking forward to school, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
That he's alive, I found out when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of crying Gregory in San Marino.
Gregory hates looking at that picture, and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I understand it, but I also think that this picture makes people around the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Gregory says: “It is important that this is not repeated again.
"I doubt we'll find out the truth sometimes.
Similar tragedies are still investigated, but no one will ever find out the truth.
Now they're investigating the boeing crash in Ukraine.
Are we ever gonna find out what was the cause?
This world is waiting for something too bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, no one wants war, so is it possible?
There's nothing for this pain for ten years.
To forget a little bit, it takes tens of years.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
Three or four years I had a nightmare attack, but then it improved.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who killed.
That's why, when I'm approaching September 1, I'm going to the gym.
I want to honor the memorial of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get in that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim. This story is past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiac surgeon.
First I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't be healthy.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't work.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived although he was held at the feet of a terrorist killer.
Miracle: Gregori Farniyev was held at the time of the attack at the foot of a terrorist killer, but he survived.
When the attack was in full stream, he was captured in the gym, sitting next to the bomb at the foot of a terrorist killer.
It's a miracle that he survived.
"That seems to us as if it was yesterday," said Gregory, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he couldn't.
It's still with me. It's not something I threw behind my head.
Now I'm older and they say that children can deal better with bad experiences - I have to say that it's not true.
“In 2006, I went to a psychologist, and then I was a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - then - it was the first time and the last time I entered the gym again.
I'm faint.
I'm never going there again and don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
survivors: Gregori Farniev today, on the laptop with his photograph taken in the hospital after the attack
That pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know that I hate to think or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As for physical health, I'm fine.
I have to be careful about my knee that I hurt myself, but I'm walking normally.
But I still couldn't join and study at the FBS Academy in Petrograd, as I wanted.
I sent them my papers, including medical reports, and they told me that it was impossible.
My next favor is animals, so I went into the veterinary.
I finished the second year.
They learn how to treat all animals from "cats to cows".
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about it.
It's not something the kids should know about and not any more that they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “The pain will be here all the time.
He's inside and he's getting worse with the coming anniversary.
I'll attend the commentary ceremony.
I know Gregory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I waited for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God to give him back to me.
It's staying with us.
Gregory's an adult today, but he's taking that horror on.
It's hard to accept when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's done a few surgeries, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say that 50% of you already overcome the scary, but to overcome it completely and forget it can't.
This terrible experience will be with us all the time.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors have been killed, and it only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but I'm hurting the loss of the dead.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who did not marry again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what happens in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is approaching our country now, which I can hardly believe.
In the past we were a friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure there were many children in Ukraine and they'll still be killed.
If we could take all those rebels and throw them away as far as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child that took a special command to safety
Saved: Alyon Tskaevu is carrying into a safe Russian special command (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't even remember tragedy
In 2004, the world caught a breath when a Russian policeman took Alyona in his arms from Belsanese captivity.
However, the terrorists released her, while she was captured in the school’s gym, they left her 30 - year - old mother, a ten - year - old sister, Christine and Brother Makhar.
Makhar, who was three years old, escaped, but Alyon’s mother and sister died at the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and with his new wife, Lighten, they have a girl named Christine after their dead daughter.
The neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten years old, doesn't even remember the attack and grow from her a brilliant and happy girl.
A close friend declared that “he is a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great children. ”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep his children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary reminds.
You can understand why.

4 tips how to get better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in photographing or filming underwater, you have a great choice of equipment.
The cheapest option is a compact like Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera of type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these photos at a family party a few cameras, all of them cost less than $350.
No matter what equipment you use, but a number of rules apply to achieveing the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a water-vasive camera, make sure that batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Next set the camera according to what type of photos or videos you will acquire.
Some cameras and videocams have a scenic or filming mode that optimizes exposure to the dark environment underwater.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, more than 50 to 60.
Read our guide by shopping and evaluation of digital cameras in normal and water-controlled implementation.
You always make a few pictures - a lot of them won't work.
Compact cameras have LCD that will help you with a composition of photos, but the outsiders don't have it.
Even if you have LCD, underwater is going to be badly seen and the composition of the recording will be unpredictable.
So always make more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing regime which makes a series of images with a slightly different distinction of exposure, use it.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper underground of light, it is significantly disturbed.
If possible, hold on photos in the pool, lake or sea near the level.
It also allows you to get more light on photos - the deeper you're going to flood, the less colors you'll see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That's an excellent advice if you take pictures of the land, but underwater it's even more important because of a more eclipse light.
It is especially important if you film with the outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a solid and wide angle of the boot, which means that if you want to fill the camera, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose power of personality has been able to change things even in such a huge organization as NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieve the pain caused by disease and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who searched for his help was an officer of MI6, who had to live with the consequences of the torture that bothered him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and diseases, treated patients in a nauseous majority are very interested in something else: pain.
However, one day in 2007, it was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May that year.
I felt out of energy.
He faced the symptoms of the flu and found out that he was impatient and that Juliet included his wife in regrets.
He noted: “I want everything to happen more sooner than later. ”
When Juliet left for a week, Lawson was unusual and unexplainably upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague made his chest rentgen.
Once two weeks ago, he skied in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray came.
He had a mezotelliom, an unhealthy tumor that affects the negligence or the lungs.
For most of the cancer species, it is difficult to determine what was their cause.
Although some smokers get the lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
Mezotelliom is different.
Almost in all cases, the cause of the exhibition of azbest - building fibre material, which was earlier referred to as “magical, ” but today it is known to be deadly dangerous.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore mezotheliom.
Azbest, eventually, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in Britain since the 1960s when the prohibition of the use of azbest in the industry has entered into force.
Even at the time the asbest was used, only certain groups of people, such as isolation, builders, carpenters, and shipping workers, came to close contact with him.
The toxin used in industry in another era is now difficult to seem to be a cause for fear.
But that's not what it's like.
As it appears, in Britain today, the Mezotheliom epidemic is at the top.
The number of deaths on mezotheliom is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2.500 deaths on this disease per year are twice as many as the number of car accidents.
Number of deaths on the consequences of mezotheliom yearly since 1980 and estimated death in the future in Great Britain
The reason why we only now feel its effects, although the use of azbest has been illegal for years (all species of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades before the mezothelium develops.
The disastrous in the form of mezotelliom does not only affect the veterans of the construction industry.
Azbest was, and in many cases he is still present in homes in which we live, in our offices, in schools where we learn, and in the stores in which we shopping.
Mezotheliom therefore disrespects the social layer, wealth, career, or age.
Privileged gardens from London trading homes after public schools do not represent a shelter.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even hospitals in which we should be treated are the storage of this mortal cancer.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put in isolation.
He was trying to find out where he could get in touch with the azbest.
Then he found out.
"It is possible that many asbestos were in the basement halls of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
Everyone -- students, sisters, doctors and doormen -- used halls.
The question is, how many of my currents get the same disease?
Unfortunately, this was the question he could partly answer.
“For four doctors who were in practice in Guy's Hospital and then showed themselves mezotheliom in the past five years,” he noted in the letter in 2010, “I am the only one still alive.”
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mezotelliom when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
Living with this diagnosis is not common for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosticated with mezotelliom will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The illness is always dead.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question, “How many of us will have the same disease? ”
According to the primary British expert on the mezotellio of Professor Julian Peta, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain occurs, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Azbest mine in Quebec, Canada
In the executive review of the archives of courts to which disabilities often turn and require compensation, it shows how much the mezotheliomic disaster has spread.
For example, this June Marks & Spencer admitted that she exposed Janice Allen asbestos from negligible care.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she was watching in two sales sections of clothing - one of the places was the flag ship of society, the Oxford Street shop.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today she has two children who are over 20.
"Before it happened," he says, "I never heard of mezotheliom before, I barely knew something about asbestos.
I never thought in my dream that he might have anything to do with me.
There are not many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, azbest is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
He was named by his fibrose structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in construction.
The most commonly available in buildings today is the foundation of chrysotile, commonly known as white asbest.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler ties and even in brake.
It is not as mortal as other forms of asbest, the EU and the WHO still consider it a “great health risk” that can cause death.
But more dangerous is brown azbest (amosit) and blue azbest (crokidolit).
Britain was once the biggest world importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that “there is a convincing but indirect proof that this was the main cause of an unusually high phenomenon of mezotheliom [in the United Kingdom]. ”
Marsk & Spencer employee was exhibited at the flag store in Oxford Street in London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical victim of mezotheliom, but Julian Pete's work indicates that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients claims that “a major part of the cases of mezotelliom without a known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was likely caused by an azbest in the environment. ”
A significant part of this exposure is caused by “use and entertainment” buildings.
Looks like no one can be sure he's safe.
The report Goddard Consulting, who studied the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government don't have the idea that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that provides the service lifts and tubes behind the parliamentary committee's rooms contaminated by azbest, whose death fibres could be broken by something as harmless as “power air flow”.
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case it may be the opposite of the truth.
Although the Parliament's Directorate of Services insisted that the Westminster Palace receives a “good medical certificate”, it is now counting that one million pounds and a few years of work will be needed to be reviewed, the Parliament has modernized electricity and removed asbest, and that after the elections in 2015, the Members will rather sit in the Westminster green clubs in the area of the Conferency Centre of the Queen of Elizabeth II.
The Goddard report states that “the presence of azbest is not in accordance with several regulations. ”
It's impossible to say that this disagreement will cost life.
Everyone can just wait now.
One of those who have never been able to determine when they were exposed to azbest is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Just like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) has suspected that he was exposed to asbestos at work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of azbest was demonstrated," he says, "but in my own case I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was overwhelmed by something like cold.
He was 45, he was in the middle of the surgery.
I got shaken suddenly.
It came at once.
I was awful.
I thought I wasn't going home with a car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming out of the cotton, the screwing around the lungs.
But just like Janice Allen, she had no reason to believe that it was mezothelia.
Finally, he spent a month at home.
The confused doctors made him a rentgen of his chest and took his chest catheter to remove the fluid that they sent from his lungs.
Still, they didn't define diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
But from time to time, symptoms returned to him, often after he exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms came to the surgery and then diagnosticated mezotelliom.
Even then Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older, and he got in direct contact with azbest at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011 Abbott's condition has gotten worse again, and his doctor consulted his photos from CT and rentgen with the expert panel.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started feeling sick, he had been introduced by a camera-equipped sonda between the turkey and the pulmonary steel.
I'm a optimist.
I have a tendency not to marry much," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't really worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: “They told me it was mezotheliom. ”
Graham Abbott: diagnosticated with mezotelliom
Abbott started meeting with sisters from the Macmillan charity organization, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that point, he realized the scope of the epidemic.
"The azbest has proved to be extensively used, especially in large public buildings that often have azbest heat isolation in the pipe," he says.
For those who were exposed in these asbestos, the disease is now exposed.
Mezotelliom, therefore, is now about younger people who do not have a risky job.
The most dangerous heat isolated azbest tubes were in the basement in the hospitals, so it was unlikely to threaten patients.
However, members of staff who walked through basement halls between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or eating in basement dining rooms (as often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it appears now, a few decades after the war of the hospital, they were places where patients could save their lives, but also a place that could threaten the life of doctors who treated them.
Azbest is being removed today.
Bunsen's cahan students were building on asbestos
And it's not just a hospital.
Asbest was often used in offices, stores, libraries, and councils because of his excellent isolation and unbearable qualities.
In schools, too.
In fact, many asbestos have been exhibited in school.
Somewhere in the hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's cahan on the asbestos.
There were websites dealing with asbestos in schools.
The harmless things such as floor tiles or roofs of the roofs on the tools in our homes usually contain azbest.
"One of the industrial poison is built into a large number of homes," Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact with the azbest that a woman suffering from mezotheliom was able to remember in the 70 ’ s while fighting a garden house.
So be careful how you wander the garden house.
Aware that the disease is unhealthy, the effect of diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while before you get through it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I found that I can't focus on what I'm doing.
I've been in the surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live next Christmas.
One of the hardest things was the transition from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As a bunch of patients before him, he also remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was difficult to understand all of this," he said.
“ I asked my doctor, ‘ How much time do I have left? ’
I was told that twelve months.
I remember saying, “Well, I won’t live next Christmas.
That's it."
Mezotelliom is particularly destructive, because the mechanism of what keeps us alive -- breathing itself -- is what causes cancer that kills us.
Most of the cases of mezotheliom are caused by exposure to azbest.
Azbest forms small fibres.
When azbest is broken and the threads are breathed, they can sit in the shore, the lung steel.
Azbest fibres are irritating and can cause mutation of cells.
"The problem is the inspired azbest fibres in the form of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, cardio surgeon, who entered Guy's Hospital in 2001.
In the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is paradoxically the headquarters in the treatment of mezotelliom.
The Treasure of Lawson knows and treats other patients who were probably exposed to asbestos during the hospital practice.
The azbest needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “self - breathing pushes them on the edge of the shelter.
He's been invasive from the beginning.
The ordinary treatment options used in other types of cancer do not take so much on the mezotelliom.
For example, it is warm to discuss the effectiveness of the operation.
Some think she'd be worth an attempt.
The treasure doesn't agree.
"You can't remove the hammer," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
The cancer “does not respond too much to chemotherapy ” which, though,“ has any effect ” but does not treat.
“ Sometimes there is someone who can survive the lung cancer, ” says Treasure.
But eventually they'll all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than they expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years since Graham Abbott's own diagnosis is still fighting.
After discovering the mezotelliom, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years since his diagnosis, became individual support and advisor for the same disabilities.
When they called, he joyfully presented himself: “Good day, you have called to the center of cancer. ”
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott had offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months, and likely would only extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson “has been able to show things in a more optimistic light. ”
After visiting a number of doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdusky from the Breast Surgery Division in Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage that I didn't have to wait to be sent to him, but I just called there and they looked at me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a request, and they would have to approve his refund.
In order to get to the best available treatment, the question of money is key to patients with mezotheliom.
But when different treatments eventually fail, many patients face another financial mayor -- the future of the family they leave here.
That's why he turns to courts and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"From 1898, asbest was known to be harmful," says Morgan.
However, in the 1960 ’ s, it was found that a very small quantity could also be a health risk.
And here we meet with the company's carelessness.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually balanced, but according to Morgan, it was not a “complete compensation” because Lawson could definitely not prove that the mezotheliom was the result of the exposure of azbest in Guy's hospital.
However, after the investigation of the case, speaker Guy's Hospital confirmed that “azbest in the incriminated basement was removed in the 1990s. ”
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove azbest
The exhibition of a death asbestos to one company or a place of work -- usually ten years after that -- has shown a huge problem for patients with mezotelliom trying to compensate.
Many former jobs have changed the owners or crashed.
The security record's lost.
And those who now defend themselves by accusation have time on their own side, which their prosecutors do not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation has been approved this year, which makes it easier for patients with mezotheliom to seek compensation, even if it is not possible to monitor their former employer.
The Act created a 350 million financial reserve which is built by insurance and which is intended for people diagnosticated since July 2012, who can prove that they were exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, they will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally refer to them as compensation - approximately 120 000 pounds.
Each year, 300 successful requests are expected.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mezotelliom, believes that 350 million pounds are “good work. ”
"It is an agreement written by insurance insurance companies," he said and pointed out that the sum is a quarter of what insurances would have to pay if the time had not ended and the people with mezotelliom would be able to search for former employers and to sue them in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, a former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “had had spaces. ”
But Penning and Morgan admit that, due to seven deaths, each year, a rapid negotiation was required.
"The people suffer too much and need help immediately," Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the mezotheliom law.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunskio 19 months.
After initial consultations, he recommended Lang-Lazdunski surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasura, he thought he had a positive effect.
After surgery, radiation and chemotherapy followed - a three-treatment with Lang-Lazdunski may be praised to survive for five years to 40% of patients.
Abbott made it stronger.
"Of course this is not the most important thing," Abbott says.
You see it all the time in patients.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get very quickly worse.
Graham Abbott performed an operation in March 2012.
In the end of August, he finished the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
The surveillance did not show any symptoms of disease.
I went to another check in March [2014].
In my chest, I had a few stains of cancer.
My fiftieth birthday was just coming.
It doesn't threaten life.
He's taking it.
Abbott reinstated six cycles of chemotherapy.
At present, there are no signs of tumor in his body.
But it is physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show my wife how the cottage is working.
When you know the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
Like for Ellie's father (16) and Tamsin (14) it's not always easy.
"For parents, it's hard," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition means I'll never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more delaying.
She didn't say much.
Such interviews must be faced by all patients with cancer.
However, such interviews are not embarrassed by hope or just a sign of the chance of survival.
The disease brings (and eventually brings Stephen Jay Gould) unhappy certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “the mezotheliom does not threaten life. ”
The bodies of the balsamated Pharaohs are packed into the asbestos platoon.
Azbest fibres are used to boost cooking pots and increase resistance to the light.
Plinius Senior describes asbest.
The fabric was invented, which was unbearable.
I've seen her make up some of the browses that shine in the carpets on the guests.
In Italy, azbest begins to appear in commercial use, is used to produce paper (also banknotes) and tissues.
Great asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa, soon afterwards in America, Italy and Russia.
During the industrial revolution, it is an excellent isolation substance in pair engines and turbines.
World production of asbestos is increasing to more than 30,000 tonnes a year.
Insurance statistics Prudential detect higher mortality in people working with azbest and then deny life insurance.
In Rochdale, Nellie Kershaw is dying.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that particles of azbest in her lungs “was no doubt the cause of her death. ”
It's the first case of this kind.
The employees of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, are deniing responsibility.
They won't pay any compensation.
During World War II, ships are intensely built, work in ships represents the highest risk of asbestos exposure.
Prohibition of imports of blue azbest
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful lawsuit for health injury due to the exposure of azbest in Britain.
World production of azbest is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tonnes a year.
The United Kingdom imports 139,000 tonnes.
The British Health and Security Institute requires all asbestos suppliers to have licences.
Import and use of blue and brown asbestos are prohibited in Britain by law.
The use of all kinds of azbest is prohibited in Britain.
The Law on Mesotheliom shall enter into force in the United Kingdom.
The 350 million compensation program is launched.
Azbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbest continues to be used as cheap construction material.
World production is held on two million tonnes a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
The Chinese Parliament, despite the multiplication of democratic reform on Sunday, decided not to allow the Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for elections in 2017.
It is likely that this step will provoke long promised protests in the Hong Kong business quarter, since activists have started organizing and planning only a few hours after this notification.
The Chinese People's Congress in fact allows communist leaders to dismiss any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't surprise us, but it made us angry," said the lawmaker Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it's clear that we're dealing with the authority regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of Li Fei said that public nomination in Hong Kong's elections would cause "haos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned the Hong Kong administration to China, Peking promises that in the beginning of 2017, people will be able to vote in the power.
The Chinese leaders presented Sunday decisions as a democratic breakthrough, because Hong Kong allows direct votes, but also clearly shows that Chinese leaders hold firmly in their hands the nomination process of the committee which is strictly controlled by Peking.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who love the country and Hong Kong will be allowed.
The decision came after summer months that recorded one of the biggest and most follow-up protests in Hong Kong in a few years.
For most of the pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong, the Occupation of the Centre with love and peace, whose organisations threatened the closure of the financial quarter, unless Peking gives them the universal voting law.
On Sunday night, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of favorites of the Occupation's movement gathered in the rain before the Hong Kong government's office.
At the demonstration, the organizers informed that their movement is entering a new stage of civil disobedience and that the waves of protests start in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, and obviously they wanted to avoid the problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organisations said that the movement “respected the occupation of the Centre only as the last step in case all options of dialogue are exhausted and there will be no other choice.
We must be regretted to notify that all options of dialogue have been exhausted today, and the posting of the Centre is inevitable.
The officials in Hong Kong have been preparing for Peking's notifications all days and strengthened the protection of the government's office on Sunday and placed police and barricades.
The incitement of anxiety is a sign that many inhabitants of Hong Kong are slowly losing control of the city.
The inclusion of people from the land increases competition in products and services.
The concerns are also growing that values as democracy and freedom of speech are declined by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupation of the Centre and say their demonstration is threatening the trade - a rescue boat of Hong Kong.
"The protest he talks could cause much more economic damage according to how many people will attend and how long," says the political Regina Ip, who has long-term criticised movement.
We don't want the concerns that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perception could harm the investment.
China's state media also came with reports in recent days, which democratic activists in Hong Kong render as counterfeit agents managed by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which came to 780 000 participants -- more than five voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people attended one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
Pre-election agitation?
The League in Jihlava is named by political movement
He plays with a small swimming game in the district city of Heights about 1,600 amateur sportsmen.
And their highest competition is newly called Common for Jihlava League.
The name was given according to one movement that goes to October's community elections.
The tenth of his candidate is also the boss of the little scattered in Jihlava Jan Dark.
"There was a bunch where there was no problem," said the Dark.
The situation around the first league of small scatters has already been dealt with by the lawyers of the J.O.'s board and recommended to change the subsidy division system.
A small screwed up last year on the city's website about a million crowns.
It's about hundreds of thousands this year, too.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not a small blow in contrast with the law or directives of the magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules of grants and grants," said the speaker of the Mastership of Radek Tulis.
Drawing a subsidy from the city and expressing at the same time as a small blown support in the elections of one political party, it probably won't work anymore.
A high-level football like this has not yet come from politics.
That the CHSSD may be a district overcome, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for it.
On the contrary, I'd like to have sponsors from a series of companies turned to us," Miroslav Vrzjaček, President of the District Football Union, noted.
The boss of the small football of the other party and the movement to the name of the league
According to the players, this sport in Jihlava would earn its own area with six fields, dresses and social equipment.
"For example, the field on the Stoups is not ours, we are in rental," told Ondrej Lapeš from Starlet Jihlav's Club.
The most suitable place would be the Czech mill.
But there will be for example, in my opinion, a nonsense area for scatters, which is about fifty in Jihlava," said the Darkness.
The Primator of Jihlava Jaroslav Emazal (ODS) responded that a small slipper uses a field with artificial grass in the streets of Roski and Stoups, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build a field that has the maximum use.
We are going to modernize or build sports at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think for a small slide, he has made a huge progress in the past years," he added.
Other political parties in the names of the Leagues will not appear according to John Darkness.
We have restrictions.
If one of our partnerships enters one of our businesses, we don't give another there anymore," he explained.
"Politic movement on behalf of the League, I consider that at least an unhappy step," said the Council Committee for Sports Karel Voldan.
"Let the voters assess whether Mr. Dark is using the compound Little Jihlava and the subsidies of the city for political purposes, or not," he added.
American tradition entails a university life - the first men can fly with a trigger plane
We are glad that we can answer the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression at the arrival of the university, the company also offers the possibilities of transport, including a private rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also declared that the service has its security site.
The service is an ideal option for students who otherwise would have to drag their things across the whole state in a dangerous car.
We are looking forward to ensuring that with our VIF (more important fresher - very important first-year) this year, students will be able to reach the university with a minimum of nerve and luxury.
The speaker company said that since the services were just launched, they had no booking yet, but he added: “The students will start booking during a few weeks. ”
The company also stated that, although students pay annual schools of 9000 pounds, they expect the service to find their place on the market.
In comparison with students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, students today are different about expectations and wishes - is more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the appropriate way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticised the service as unaccessible.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, this project is not available.
Many of the students that attend the university this month must be compared to the financial crisis before they throw thousands of pounds for something as simple as they reach the railway, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot hold a step with the increase in the cost of basic needs.
Feminists are against racism and conduct of police after events in Ferguson.
At the beginning of the month, he killed a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, an unarmed young man.
Those who are waiting for the funeral with their hands up, scandal: "Do not shoot your hands up, do not shoot."
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, for shooting an unarmed young man Michael Brown, a blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz was recorded in the Internet discussions of white feminists.
She found that, when the promotion of reproductive rights and equality of income, white feminist women prefer sex before race.
With the increased voltage in the Middle West, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the reaction of whites focused at 100% on the race.
In comparison with the reactions of the blacks shortly after the shooting of 9 August, personal articles with titles such as “the idea of a white woman over Ferguson” or“ Feminism is not just a woman's oppression” appeared relatively late.
But, according to Perez, this is an important change.
"I don't think in a feminist movement there are many people who would talk about race and privileges at this level," she said.
People felt that what happened had to be expressed.
For the crisis we face, it is characteristic because [Ferguson's situation] is so racially exhausted that they had to note it.
According to the English professor at Ohio Corithy Mitchell State University, Ferguson has brought Ferguson into light the problems that African Americans must face every day and which are not seen as “women's questions”.
"I can publish fun stories of life on Facebook with my partner and it gets 150 characters from people around the world," Mitchell said.
If I write something about the colors in their own land trapped, it's silent deaf.
"How can a woman speak publicly about relations, but not security in public space?" she asked.
For niggers like Mitchell, who were dealing with race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no between race and gender dichotomy.
The black girls were unable to share the luxury closely: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although the white women today are combined with the question of race and gender in the mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor lecturing a woman's question and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors were doing the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black people were lynched and the reason was almost in all cases of rape of the white woman," said Hattery.
To justify the lynching you needed the collaboration of white girls.
According to Hattery's division between white girls and black girls, when the warriors for election law such as Susan B. Anthony examined at the end of the 19th century and realized that election law could only have one group of people -- women or blacks.
"They decided to bet cards on the voting law for women and the right to focus on black people later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important view of why colored women don't believe white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black people protect their husbands and children.
Even after women received election law in 1920, it took ten years before they started organizing against linching in the Southern Women's Association for Prevention of Lynching.
The group came up for 40 years after the blacks first told each other about help.
According to Mitchell, the reaction of white feminists to the questions that the situation in Ferguson brought -- the question of the conduct of the police, racial discrimination -- reflects the time when white feminist women had to "go to" questions with which the blacks were dealing with generations.
"Isn't it great that activists in these areas [traditional feminism] take the right to raise the child as seriously as they take the right to anti-conception?" Mitchell said.
The second wave of feminists who made a career fighting for reproductive law and access to contraception now find out what that means.
The major feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot by Facebook, where they published the column of Rebeccy Carroll from Guardian, which required white Americans to protest more racism.
"I hope that women who have different but still similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and the views of the race that differ significantly in public opinion - will seek to change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem has become intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the question of race in America are mathematical.
The American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book “Who stole feminism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, in particular young colored men, are“ much vulnerable than their sisters, ” but the notes of the Steinem side of Ferguson face the criticism that she has already called before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost no boys.
But when the White House launched a small program My Brother's Keeper, who was to help vulnerable young black and Spanish, it caused many feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry response.
The relationship of the police with the black community is not the only problem that comes forward to the interest of mainstream feminism.
After the US Border Police held this year in the southwest of the country nearly 63,000 youths without accompanyment, the issue of reform of immigration laws -- this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercad, co-president We Belong Together, the organization mobilizing women for reform of immigration laws, said that to be able to talk about as necessary for women, the only thing she had to do was to share immigrants' stories.
"He speaks for himself," Mercad says.
Since most of the work permits are granted to men, women who come with them are in a position where they are vulnerable, as regards domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a voice in women's organisations," she said.
Accommodation of pigs in Ipswich for sale
The real office removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when she published it, rested on it in the pig's living room.
A single single house, which is for sale for 120 000 pounds, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The information photos included the picture of the living room where he rests with his head on the pig couch.
The real office of Connells stated that the pig on the photo is a pet of owners.
"The photograph was mistaken, and it was already removed," the spokesman of the office said.
In the real estate information, Connells’ real estate office described the former prayers as “a single single single room house”.
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it is still appearing in promoting materials.
The sale of the house caused interest in social networks where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After winning in the lottery, Harvey has the city in the southwest of a fresh millionaire
The lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
There is a search for a new millionaire in the southeast of Perth, and one lucky man will take $1.1 million from the Saturday lottery trip home.
Traffic in Harvey had twice during five years, the last time in November 2009 there was a million dollars winning.
But the lucky winner has only to log in.
The owner of the store Steve Forward said the whole city in the southwest of Pertha was talking about winning.
It's the main theme and they're all upset.
We thought a similar win was for touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia shared one victory last month, resulting in a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of the five August millionaries and only a few weeks earlier in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple has been betting for twenty years and said that the win will allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
A millionaire from Harvey is the 59th only winner of the lottery in Western Australia this year, totally won $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
Machines want higher wages
In the press statement, GDL marked the protest for a warning strike for which he deliberately chose time outside the transport peak.
Chosen time of strike GDL takes attention to many people who go back on the railway from the weekend until the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people coming at work during the day," the Union said on Monday morning in a press statement to announce the strike.
"Our first strike should be affected primarily by cargo transport, less passengers," GDL complemented.
The DB has not yet published the official response to the release of the strike.
It is not even clear how the protest action affects international railway links, including the Czech Republic.
The committees require an increase in the remuneration of the engineers by five per cent and the reduction of working hours by two hours a week.
Currently, the average salary of the engineering leaders is moving in depending on the years of work between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998,000 and 1,27 million crowns) per year.
Machines at DB work 39 hours a week.
The DB refuses to access the growth of salaries in reducing working hours.
They emphasize that the remuneration of the engineers must be developed as well as in the other railroad personnel in which the DB is not counted by reducing the working week.
It threatened the Cross car to start burning.
That's why Barum Rallye ended
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was completely new, so I didn't even think anything like that could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be fixed and continue slower to the service where the mechanics would exchange it?
If we could go straight there, yes.
But we were still waiting for two other ercets, and it couldn't.
There's high temperature in it, and the risk of the car to start burning was great.
I can't afford that.
You've done five speed tests in full pace.
What kind of impression did you have?
Very good.
I felt like a young man.
We were fast, and I didn't go through the vint.
Everything was caused by the car we've been caring over a half-year to be at some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You've driven him so you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car by actually winning.
The job didn't come out.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought about has not arrived.
But it's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technique said no.
You weren't the only one of the tops who left the fight for the championship early.
He's also got out of him by foreign favorites of Breen, Abbreing or Lappi.
Did you be surprised that so many favorites dropped away?
Yes.
Mostly for the audience, it was a shame because the race was over early.
And Jaromir Tarabus was on the highway for a long time.
But he paid for flying out of the trail and picking up a nearly two-minute manco.
How satisfied you with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the degrees of winners.
He was driving the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was well prepared.
He's been very fast.
Just a year ago you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the Barum Rally launch.
Can you make a good feeling of driving again a regular participant of the rally race?
Not at this point.
Last year I told you Barumka was my last race, and I didn't hold it anyway.
I decided to ride her again.
It was my nineteenth start here, and if there's a chance again in a year, I'm probably going to go.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the trail just because of you.
Have you been pleased?
Somehow, we've been starting for them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, constantly asked if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you after Barumca?
The team goes on.
Next week we'll go to Wyschkov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
Besides, he wants to borrow from us the fabia of Honz Sikor.
With Peace, we are waiting for a European binary in Switzerland and in Korsica.
We'll have to prepare things for the next year.
Can you say something?
No, nothing's decided.
When Corsic Rallye belonged to the world's championship, you reached your fifth maxim in the series.
Doesn't it attract you to try the trails again?
He's not attracting.
The oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not let your doctor confirm the worklessness that serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform jobs for health reasons.
Furthermore, you haven't announced the employer immediately.
The agreement was thus concluded that the days would be recorded as holidays, but the agreement only took place in oral terms.
Although the labour law does not require a letter of approval to the employer with a vacation, this procedure has been effective in practice.
If there's only an oral agreement, you don't have a confirmation agreement.
Later, the alleged acceptance of vacation as well as in your case, may be denied and absence in work as a long-term unexcused absence, thus the reason for immediate cancellation of the working relationship under § 53 of the Law of Labour.
In the case of a court dispute about the contract with the employer, you lack proof.
The working relationship with you was not cancelled under § 53, but you only have the days listed in the accounting sheet as an unexcused absence.
Unexcused absence in the budgetary paper does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the inability to collect material unemployment), however, the difficult possibility of searching for new employment is difficult.
We recommend you to visit the doctor again and to confirm in writing that there has been a serious injury that causes you to become unavailable (not just a "unspeak", it's just a doctor's document).
You can present the document and explain the situation when looking for a new job.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the exhibition of written medical confirmation of worklessness, such as rapid notification to the employer or the request of written consent with the withdrawal of the vacation.
You're avoiding any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident when returning to the trail
Return to the trail ended for Tony Stewart just a little bit at the half of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stewart secondly hit the plaque after his right front tyres broke in 172 round, and the race for him ended.
Stewart brought a ruined car to the garage, didn't show up to the reporters, and he left.
The chief of his team Chad Johnston said the car team number 14 was disappointed, but now he will focus on the Richmond race, in Virginia, which will be done next weekend.
"I wish we had better performance and better conclusion," Johnstone said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we'll be better there.
Stuart ran into the placement for the first time in the Sunday evening race after the colliction with Kyle Busch, which demanded repair of the right side of his car.
"We put hopes on a good end to the race today," said Johnston and added, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team was packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver in the New York race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend, and he needed to win either the Atlantic race or the next Richmond race to reach the place in the table.
He returned to the race during the investigation of a tragic accident, where the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Junior, who ran Stewart during the race to the trip.
The authorities said the investigation of the cause of an accident would take at least two weeks.
So far, it hasn't decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-fold champion came to warm encouraging before the race.
Stewart started at the 12th place, at the beginning of the race, he worked on 10 and then even 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122, Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, pulled out of the second turn, and hit Stewart, sending both cars into the building.
Stewart went on, but he retired to the 21st place.
Prague elected a new taxi position manager, earned 12.3 million
The threshold completed the selection procedure at the new taxi manager.
In 103 parking stations, he gets approximately 12.3 million crowns per year.
Recently, she picked 150,000 crowns for drivers of cars a year.
It was informed by Councilman Luke Manhart (TOP 09).
The former city used the screwing.
The winner then got a rental for a standard amount of 1000 crowns a year.
But the rules have changed.
It is currently deciding the above of the offer.
"The year since the initial rental contracts and the opening of elections has been shown that the new rental system is far more advantageous and fair for Prague," the Council states.
The most expensive flek is in Persian
The highest price was offered by stakeholders on the street in Perston.
They pay 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately 1,5 million crowns the new governors paid for places in front of the General House or at the Václava Square.
The new rental rules of the tax rental positions were adopted by the Council at the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year the original rental contracts were declared.
The selection procedure took place in four waves and the new manager found 29 positions.
For the second time, we had to clean the well this year.
We've let her go every time, and there's a practically second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured Savo there.
Unbelievable couch!
Our well in the basement always sneaked enough of a beautiful smell of water.
And it wasn't kind of professional, but Grandpa scratched her with his help.
It's been a long time ago.
She was just on three circles and totally incredible, like everything else in the cabin, but as I say.
Water was great.
Until the summer.
When we started the season, of course we exhausted the water.
When she stood there for a few months, she deserved it.
But even after that, we didn't seem to smell like the water.
We've been wondering if there's something falling.
In the place where the pump was passed, it was possible at a bit of misfortunate, the board was not quite laying down there, so the hole was squeezed by a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we enlightened her to the bottom.
So we let her go and clean her up again.
Of course, we've improved improvised stiffing around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
There was a sticky pack of bones on the ground.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a piece more.
Now it looked like a blinded mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where it is, the grandfather's invention, there were the rest of the fish!
And it's hard!
Our cemetery is too awkward.
Someone would say Grandpa just grabbed the cabin.
And he wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just choked sand, only the ceiling is understood.
There are mainly ships.
And the car.
And a beach bed.
The door with broad spaces was mostly opened, as someone walked there in one piece.
On the ceiling of a few already mentioned products.
No network, so birds usually fly there and build nests on the trams.
Mouses are useless to mention.
Grandpa wanted it to blow, and that's what he did.
No, of course, it didn't even help.
The whole basement smelled.
So we cleaned up the whole basement.
Especially that fish on the barn was food!
We also threw out things around: boards, heroclic boards, and so on.
Our house on the distance welcomed the surrounding disinfective tube.
We've been wondering who could have dragged the disgusting remains there?
The nearest cat lives two miles from here in all.
She'd hardly come to the house.
The grandfather was attacked by a neighbor who wasn't quite well.
If he didn't get that franta out there with our ghosts?
He's been here almost a year, stupid ideas, that's what he has.
We decided to watch the basement and the well and check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using water again, while only washing and washing before the tests were finished, but it was good.
Drawing water from the forest studio is nothing I'd like to do for a while.
Once we heard a horrible nervous assassination of our phenomenon.
My mom looked out of the balcony and saw her grass next to the veranda with a long, strong black snake.
The cut jumped over her and screamed like a fool.
My mom gave her money because she thought Réza was digging a waste sandwich from the washing room.
But suddenly, the scrambled partially into the club and partially straightened.
The balcony's been screwed.
Rheza got a hysterical attack.
We ran downstairs.
The battery, long over a meter and fat as a bull, was going to swallow a huge squirrel and Réza stopped it.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the belly or whether she wanted to eat it alone, but that was insignificant.
When she saw the excess in the form of our whole family, she probably said to eat it when we were hungry and elegantly stretched through the dungeon.
We flew after her.
She jumped into the cold as a lightning.
By the way, we just recorded another smelling package on her desk.
It smells like a fish.
She wasn't there yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a little shadow.
And that's the cellar that we locked up all the day.
That he'd...
We went out, and there we all layed up for one air.
We haven't waited long.
It screwed up in the club.
First there was a flat headlamp with yellow moons on the neck.
And then the whole blade came up to the colonel.
She turned around the pump and started getting in.
A dismissed employee revenged, bought a company of laptops and sold them.
Heavy employee after his release bought a computer company and then sold it.
He got the money gained before the police were arrested.
During a short period, a man bought in 12 cases a total of 16 computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"He took the laptops to Olomouce, where he sold them by basers," said the High Commissioner of the Shooter Police Rostislav Brückner.
The motive of fraud was the revenge of the employer for release and the profit of money.
"In the interrogation, he claimed that he used money to pay credits," Bruckner told us.
The police also found that a fraud was a pathological player who was treated repeatedly on psychiatric treatment.
Money could also end in winning devices or videoloteria terminals.
"The fact is, we haven't found any money at him," said the Commissioner.
A fraud who was once punished for stealing is now threatened to stay in prison for a year to five years.
Policemen have not yet told whether they are also threatening the basers who bought the laptops under price and continued to sell them.
"It is true that they were taking completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the Commissioner stated.
However, none of the owners of the base have been accused yet.
Come on, a little bit more, you can handle it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the orderers have made a few changes to us.
It was the greatest change in the route that brought the aim to the flood, instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it somehow on the other side.
With the entire team, we decided to personally healthy our readers on the stand where we took photos together and filmed videos.
In order to reach perfection, I accepted the role of a personal guide.
My friend and I, Katja, just before the startup, were obedient to the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes.
We said goodbye to friends who walked around us to the faster runner sector.
It wasn't much time left.
A few hops to warm up, turn the sports, counting and start!
The screaming of the jassote, but instead of a quick start, there was a cup to the starting line.
After five minutes, we're coming to the gate, switching the measurement and running at a rate of ten.
We screw up a yellow snake of runners who run their first race like Katja.
So far, all of the fresh, slowly falling sun on the sky is providing a view to the Heaven nearly to a hiking breath.
The pumping flesh flowing along the coast looks like the whole Prague is running here.
On the coast between the Eastern and the National Theatre, it is traditional to show who has as much power.
A light climb at the Palack Square makes many runners slow or walk.
Just before I run to the Theatre I see a police escort and right after it, the Vik Pavliste is flying incredibly at the target.
I hear a marvelous confused sigh of other runners.
I move to the edge of the trail, I encourage him, he's about to crush with me, but just before that, my leg is understood, and our hands will pass closely.
The theatre street sequence gives a chance of a short rest and breathing.
There are places in front of us where the views will give me a breath.
The turn on Manes' bridge shows Prague in the entire beauty of the sunset.
I don't breathe and my feet are almost alone.
The time of truth is coming at the first refreshing room.
When the road runs, Katja will scort about the branch and show the jump swimming.
I'm looking at if he needs help, and I'm starting a series of encouraging words so that she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It lifts up and continues with the Kozi street, it's one of the highest places in the race stage, though there's no such inflammation, but it's necessary to watch the area well.
I still don't know that the concept of the nearest place will get its real meaning later.
We are frequently encouraged by tourists and friends of other fugitives behind the Powder Gate.
I'm trying to shake myself with anyone who offers my hand, and I advise Kata, because ten flashing with fans is like half an energy stick.
It really works, we're going to speed up again, and we're going to fall pretty dramatically, and now it's starting a rushing ride.
We're running over dozens of runners, when I'm through someone especially tired, I'm trying to encourage him to say, "Come on, you can do it!"
No one's running after the last refrigerator, we're going to accelerate.
We've been running for an hour and a quarter, add, there's nothing to wait for.
Three miles to the target will be painful, but it really needs to be removed.
The sun has fallen slowly, and the ending day symbolically slowly ends the race.
The last run on the bridge, the turn, and it's just a flat to the target.
The tempo we're running, I'm wondering where the girl's taking it?
"Come on, we're going under 13, we're doing!" I'm calling.
We're trying, printing, and there's a target.
Twelve and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
The coach has given the limit of an hour twenty.
So, seven minutes under the plan.
Which is a great result.
I'm helping her get her back to the branch where she's resting for a while.
It is visible for exhaustion, but also fortunate from well-related performance.
After a while, I'm taking her out of the target space.
Euforie doesn't let us think about the button in the passages to the closet.
Here you can see that the Kozi street wasn't the nearest place.
That's what it's about to do for a swimming swim, which is under the effort of almost ten thousand runners to smash.
If someone doesn't like a crowd, it's not a place for him.
And I was wasting my head after a while, and I was wondering if those beautiful views and, in addition to the past years, the more interesting route was worth what's going on in the target.
I know from my own experience that making a race isn't funny.
If 10,000 people add to it, the rich accompanying program and the closing of the entire Prague Centre for all transport, it is a huge challenge.
This year's change in the route showed to the runners many interesting places, but it also brought several really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped in the Yellow Bath has been transferred between the runner and the race itself.
The organizers around the trail and the random audience graduated it on every metre of the trail.
Unfortunately, at the urban race, the historic center must be counted on obstacles that cannot be removed but the goal of the mass race in a place that is limited to the wall and on the other river, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say that the race ends with a goal, I evaluate it as a very leading man.
I had a little concern about the health of the participants, but in the end, everything went well.
Let us know if you liked the route, and what about the target situation.
Prisoner Overseers in Bulgaria organize protests
Thousands of prisoners throughout Bulgaria attended a national protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia's capital.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterate their demand for reinstating the original working conditions that have recently changed.
There are also higher payments on the list of requirements to be discussed with the temporary Minister of Justice Christo Ivanov.
The overseers of the month symbolically protested the new working hours and demanded return to the original twenty - hour shifts.
Although the prison supervisors and the representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they disagreed, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) informed.
"One are still ongoing," said BNR, head of the Prison Service Directorate, Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Foreign Employees at the Ministry of Interior will also be joined to the protests of prison staff.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we don't see them?
Physical bestsellers usually don't write, but Brian Green from the Columbia University in 1999 hit black.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laikas to get into the hustle of problems dealing with today with a number of theoretical physicians - trying to unify two greatly functioning but mutually uncompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is, of course, that in the case of a unified physical theory, it is not a boring story.
Physical basic problem between two key theories (even at this time our universe de facto is divided into two worlds with different laws) solved and solved so conceptively that it is worth reiterating the laikes.
In addition, Greene advised himself with the complicated material so much of the fresh and bonded that he could not find out how much interesting he had not included in his book.
Furthermore, he fixed his " mistake" from most part in the other two books: the structure of the universe and the hidden reality.
Apparently, the author would not object to the fact that his book was getting older, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe provides almost everything important, which an informed layox with ambition should understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is relatively likely that in the next years it will only be more alive in this area (because the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas"), so it is a good time to enter Green in unviolently open doors of the world of modern physics.
How many sizes can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three space dimensions, surely can sound foolish, fantastic, strange or mystic.
However, it is concrete and fully acceptable.
To understand this, let's turn our eyes away from the universe for a moment as a whole to something more groundful, specifically to a long and thin garden powder.
Imagine that you drag a hundred-four-meter garden wave on the other side of the canyon and the whole scenario from a half-mile distance (as on the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance you are easily recorded in a long horizontal direction of a twist, but if you are not suffering from brightness, you can hardly recognize the thickness of the squirrel.
Given its great distance from the sneak, you would think that the ant who is forced to live on the swimming is only one dimension in which you can walk: the left-hand dimension along the squirrel.
When someone asks you where the ant was at the moment, you will answer it only with one information: the distance of the ant from the left (or the right) end of the squirrel.
All we're saying is that from a half-mile distance, a long piece of whiskey looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, he's got fat.
If we increase everything, we see suddenly the second dimension -- in the shape of the circle that swings.
In this increased view, it is obvious that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well known left-right dimension at the length of the squirrel, but also in the "dimension in/protiv to the direction of the clock handles", i.e. around the circuit circuit cross-section.
You begin to realize that to determine the location of a small ants, you must enter two numbers: how far from the end of the sneak and where it is on the circle of the whiskey.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the squirrel is two-dimensional (colour Experts will notice that this chapter is focused purely on the disturbance theory of strings.
The non-compliance aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.)
The surface of the swimming surface is two-dimensional: one long long length dimension is illustrated by a direct arrow, dimension in the direction of the circuit, marked with a circuit arrow, is short and swing.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the sneak is long and easily visible.
The dimension of the circuit of the squirrel is short, "glumsy" and worse famous.
In order to realize the existence of the circuit dimension, we had to explore the squirrel with a considerably better resolution.
The example illustrates the important feature of space dimensions.
That they're dividing into two groups.
They can either be large, wide, and therefore directly visible, or, on the contrary, small, screwed and much worse observable.
Of course, in that case, we haven't just planned to expose the "shit" dimensions of the thickness of the squirrel.
We were just gonna take a remote view.
But if the whiskey was thin -- like hair or capilar -- we'd only expose a screwed dimension with a great effort.
Caluza sent his article to Einstein in 1919, in which he made an amazing idea that space geometry of the universe could have more than three of us known sizes.
He reasoned his radical claim that the additional dimension provides an elegant and persuasive framework in which Einstein's general relativeity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory to connect to the single, united concept structure.
Now the question is how this Kaluz's perception goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer that Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which he clearly expressed and specificed by the Swedish mathematician Oscar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the space geometry of our universe can have both large and freaked dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension of the length of the squirrel, our universe has a large, wide and lightly visible three dimensions that we realize every moment of existence.
But analogically with the circuit circle of the garden sneak can also have additional dimensions, firmly screwed into the space so small that they have remained hidden from our most perfect experimental apparatus.
In order to get a clearer idea of the substantiveness of Kaluz's remarkable proposal, let's stay at the sandwich for a while.
Imagine that we draw a black color in a relatively dense range of circles on the circle.
The distances still look like a thin one-dimensional line.
Now, with a long view of the painting, we're going to discover the screwed dimension even more difficult, because we'll see the motive from picture 2.
We clearly see that the surface of the sneak is two-dimensional, with one large and almost unlimited dimension and with the second short and circuit.
Caluza and Klein came with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but besides one small circuit dimension, there are three large space dimensions, which are four-prostor dimensions together.
It's difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imaginations, let's see the illustrations of the giant 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circuit dimension.
We increase the view of the geometry of the space on the picture, just like we've zoomed the surface of the sneak.
Each following level represents a huge increase in geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them on the fourth level of zoom), if they are swingled into sufficiently small space; so we explain that we have not directly observed them.
The fourth network represents commonly known "great" dimensions, while the circle is a new, small and swine dimension.
Just like the threads in the density of the carpet, these circles exist in every place of usual dimensions - just because of our perspective, we only covered them into cross-sections in the square network.
The background of picture 4 represents the commonly known structure of space - the common world around us - in these common measures such as metres, illustrated by a small square in the square network.
In each of the following pictures, we focus on the small area of the preliminary image; we increase it to become visible.
At first, nothing special happens as we see at several first levels of zoom.
However, if we move on our way by the microscopic properties of space further - to the fourth level of zoom in image 3 - we see suddenly the new, the shape of the circle, a swine dimension, similar to the slippers or in the density of the tissue of the carpet.
Caluza and Klein came with the idea that an additional circuit dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions as well as the spikes have a circle circle at each point of their length.
For the interest of perspective, the circuit dimensions were covered only in some, regularly placed points.
Figure 4 Caluzov and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of the space geometry summarizes.
The similarity with the swimming is obvious, even if we record important differences.
First of all, the universe has three large, far-dimensional space dimensions (of which we only draw two), whereas a large dimension is only one.
The more important difference is that we're talking about the space geometry of the universe itself, not just about any object inside the universe, such as our waist.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circuit screwed dimension is extremely miniature, recognise it is - just like the circle circle circle - much harder than to observe obvious, large and wide dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is sufficiently small, it will actually be revealed even above the powers of our most modern instruments to increase.
But the most important is that the additional dimension is not just a huge throat within the normal dimensions, as the two dimensions of illustration implies mistakenly.
The circuit dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three common dimensions.
It is the dimension of the remaining three dimensions independent as the dimensions of the top-downs, the left-to-right and the front-back independent (and colmous) each other.
A sufficiently small ants could move in all four dimensions and we would need four data, except three usual positions in the circuit dimension; if we count even time, then data five, in any case one more than we normally expect.
Did you care about it?
The book The Elegant Universe of Brian Greeen can be purchased here for books.idnes.cz.
The e-book price is 149,- Kč.
So to our surprise, we find that if we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, it shows that Kaluz and Klein are not excluded from the existence of additional dimensions if they are sufficiently small.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with just an eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can recognize the structures of a large billion billion meters.
We can hardly observe the smaller dimensions.
In 1926, Klein combined the original Kaluz's idea with several ideas from just born quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that an additional circuit dimension could have the size of approximately one Planck’s length, that is, the size far beyond today’s distinguishing capacity.
Since then, physics call the possibility of additional small space dimensions Caluz-Klein theory.
Voight Honza Homola advises how to exercise on electric guitar: 5 part
The whole essence of the "twelve" is in a 12-tact harmonic form that you can repeat freely.
Whoever sneaks in music theory finds her principle detailed here.
Jan Homola, or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
By the education of a doll and a doll driver whose facebook profile can be monitored here, from maturity 20 years ago, they live as a graph.
He's a guitarist of the Woign band, which is unfortunately not possible to leave.
The guitar is after the father, as is the brother of Matthew, the leader of the Wohen.
Start with training on one string.
"The rhythm model is on you only, you can make up anything, then just apply it to a harmonic model of twelve," Honza advises.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you need to do is listen to and watch Honza, what can be invented with the twelve harmonisation on two strings and how nice it starts to sound.
If you pick up a third string, you can already cocktail with a song.
When you finally add the fourth, watch the debugging change, Honz tells you in the video.
Next time Honza will return to the pentatonic and you'll try to put it together with the twelve.
Then exercise her honestly.
As best, you can read this in a conversation with Jane Homola at his first lesson of the game on the electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for great celebration, it recognises the castle Castle
We're taking the point and we're happy for it.
The first half time, we had more chances, the second home," said the attacker, who this time scored from the penalty.
You weren't nervous when he played, weren't you just accompanied by a huge swing?
Somehow, I didn't think of it, even though the second gate where the home fans are, it would probably be worse.
You've balanced the penalta after half an hour, but you've also got a goal from the penalty for less than four minutes.
What happened?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, the corner came up, and then the penalty came after it.
After it, you got up, and you were the best team in the first half of the time, who had more chances.
Why did this change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the incased goal until the rest.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep the pace of the game, but we couldn't.
To tell the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is also true that they said something about their break, probably they weren't very satisfied with her.
You've only been on the rival field for the first time, until you may have even got a naked home.
Why is that a difference?
I don't think it's such a difference, but it's more important to us than how we do it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plyn, that's another category.
Four matches you've been waiting for the goal, weren't you afraid that after the last fight could be similar?
Perhaps not, but obviously we are glad that since the last match, we don't have to talk about waiting for the goal.
Now, without waiting, we added another, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet for a big party.
Iceland - Love comes from a mile away crocker.
Flying on the surface of Holuhraun near the ice cream Vatnajökull, it flows through a subway tunnel from a mile away crocker.
It's under the ice cream, as well as a part of the mentioned underground lave tunnel.
This fact now is most disturbing by the scientist...
The situation remains unchanged for now.
From yesterday morning (31.8.)
2014) continues to fly out of the crack of approximately the same quantity of the lion.
In addition to the original estimates, however, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Against the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
However, scientists fear that the lave tunnel can be opened in places under the ice.
If so, in addition, with similar intensity as presented by the current eruption, it would mean enormous floods, both in the Yökulsa a Fjöllum River and on other rivers.
In the area of the eruption, it feels a strong smell of cheese, and the clouds rise from the crack.
It is definitely not an explosion suitable for tourist movement, as was in the case of an explosion at Fimmvörđuhals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are also much more gases," says volcanolog Armann Hösculdsson.
However, weather has improved significantly since yesterday, and in the morning, it was almost no air.
The tracks of the sandstorm were washed by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For the aircraft, the orange degree (second highest) for Bardjarbung and yellow (third) for Aska.
The sky over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked through her wings
A flight day in Cheb.
On the machine Boeing Stearman PT-17, an air acrobate of Peggy Valentin, which came out of the cockpit to the castle on the upper wing of the binary and also between the wings during the flight.
It's only linked to the force of muscles there.
A flight day in Chebu this year took place on the fifth, and the directors were able to prepare several interesting aircraft.
The Prime Minister took place at the oldest Czech airport not only in the use of a German acrobatka Peggy Valentin, but also a legendary chase of P-51 D Mustang or a flight Beechcraft 18.
He pulled his attention with his glowing cream.
The acrobacy called Wingwalking has origin in the United States.
After World War One, many former military pilots were so trying to be put forward.
But because of the number of death injuries, it was forbidden.
But today he is slowly returning to air days.
Peggy gets out of the cockpit to the upper wing.
He's showing different practices there.
At the end of the show, it will move to the space between the wings of the plane, where its show continues," described Ludjek Maciejček from Chebski Ultralight Club and air day organizer.
The pilot of Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main cemetery of the program, then the next show of Mustang was the reputation of the cake.
Legendary chaseman joined the surface with the Grippeny of the Czech Republic's Army in the curtain (so called on numbers).
That's the first time that air fans in Czech could see.
The Pilot Miroslav Sasawski then showed the breath of the acrobacy with the 1945 aircraft.
He was made in war, but he probably never attended her.
He was included in military reserves.
Since 1963 he has been in civil sphere.
Even as a race aircraft.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport at Monache's Contest.
In the same place there is also another Cheb Air Day Pearl, two-motor Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
The airport didn't go over a powerful machine.
His aluminished aluminium crop shined in the distance.
Amazing also obtained Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of French aircraft.
A small carriage aircraft jumped at a null Turbolet and a part of the German Hofu brought from the German delegation to the air day.
The German neighbours presented in Chebu with reconstructed planes As 18T or three-party formation of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic Return in front of the camera!
Parental concerns have been exchanged by Lucie Borhy for at least tonight for those workers.
Stress or nerve - the blond moderator doesn't know anything of it.
The modernization of television news was good for her as if she hadn’t stopped with him for two months!
It's only two weeks since the blonde ends in six weeks with women having the biggest stress after birth.
However, Lucia will not be regularly showed in the main reporting session of TV Nova.
The regular return is waiting for her according to the information of Light.cz until in a month.
Just her daughter Linda needs her more than a television watcher now.
Lucia Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a black hit.
Hand exhibitions in Prague?
Hala would sell herself, she's planning Jager's party.
It would be worthy if something like this happened during the world's championship.
But it depends on how the union will be made," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition called the Golden Facility, in which a fascinating nagan team again gathered.
Even players who were participating in a golden cap.
Players should taste, don't they?
Absolutely.
It would be just good to say goodbye to the gold generation during the championship.
I think they can find one day during the tournament when it's full free and where such a struggle can be mixed.
We'll tell Gum (Jiri Slégrova) or Bedji Scherban (the Ihlav fighter), who would take care of this...
Arena would sell herself out.
But what if you play with New Jersey play-off?
So if I get here...
But you don't want to play in representation.
Or did the Jihlav meeting change your decision somehow?
Representation and exhibition are two different things and the representation is decisive performance.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially for the world's championship.
There should be a ride of players who have to do it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you actually enjoy the Nagan meeting?
Only meeting with the players was great.
A man regained his stories and experienced a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockeyists.
Of course, the most important thing was the honour of Ivan Glink.
And it's good to remind the history of our hockey and that one generation is leaving, which really worth it.
Slavomir Lener, Vladimir Różica and Peter Čechmanek on the middle.
Do you still remember your first representation match?
It's not forgotten about.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young men: me, Robert Holic and Robert Reichel, we entered in one three.
For all, it was the first start of representation.
Well, if we dominate somehow, we can't say that.
In Jihlava, Dominik Hašek was captured for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan never surprises me on the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with that criticism, but I can't (Hashek criticised Jagra for reasons he decided to end up in the representative). He just caught great.
It's a great show, too.
You used to train with me once at night and there was a hole.
And now he's catching famous.
First the United States and then the Netherlands, the footballists start qualifications
At the NH shift Hotel, there were acquainted guests on Monday morning.
People could have seen, like, Peter Chelsea's branchman from Chelsea, the Coach-representant Paul Verba...
And there, the figure in the black squirrel, that's Tom Ross!
Arsenalu's booker and the captain of the representation arrived at a meeting about half the twelveth between the last.
There's a beautiful fight against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be pleased?" he said, when he came to the press at the team.
Czech Representation Programme
Monday 1 September: beginning of the meeting, first training
Tuesday 2 September: Training open for fans (18:30, Summer) Autograph (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September - Czech Republic (20:15, Year)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of the event
Russian and gender fans can be supported before the middle fight against the United States (20:15).
The presentation opened a Tuesday training that begins at Summer at 18:30.
And then there will be a autograph on which the Russian and Czech will not be missing.
Otherwise, this national team meeting will be more calm.
Which commends Coach Vrb, who was just complaining about the number of social actions on spring.
Finally, we will devote ourselves to what we want to do.
Now we'll focus on the Netherlands.
It's a privilege when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to exercise things that have not been for so long," the Werba commended that the national team has officially led since January.
The Czech football team will be carried out by a musketary image when entering a new qualification cycle.
Representation is behind three matches, all ready.
She remised 2:2 with Norway and Finland and lost 1:2.
However, these results were not important yet.
That's right now.
The qualifications for the European Championship 2016 will be launched by the Netherlands.
Of course, the Czech men would be helpful if they could handle the general against the United States.
The first half year was to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about being successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player of the 30-party nomination with health problems is David Lafat.
He's suffering from the temperature.
If he didn't get healed in the middle fight against the United States, Coach Vrba would have called another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman in Britain describes how after a bad diagnosis she thought she'd die for years.
After diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent the majority of adulthood in her opinion that she had only a few years of life.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of inheritance disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and the spine.
The CMT UK charity organization stated that bad diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because the disease is not known very much.
It is considered that in the United Kingdom CMT approximately 23,000 people are suffering, which can show symptoms in the field of motorcycles such as muscle weakness, immoral walk, and scrolled fingers on their feet.
Infected can also occur insensitiveness or pain, this condition is insecurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms are deteriorating through time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's attack (FA) - a disease with a very bad forecast.
She believed that before she celebrated the 18th birthday, she would be stuck to the wheel chair, and dead before she was thirty.
A mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew that I could not do the same things as others.
I fell down every day, and everything took me longer.
I've never been able to ride with other kids on a wheelboard or a skateboard, and I've been kidding at school for walking and running."
When Rodgers was thirteen and after several surgeries that had to release her Achilles' hooks and compare her feet, she used her doctor to leave the room, and looked into her documentation where she found out that she suffered from the FA.
"I felt guilty because I was screwed up, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I looked for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she said.
When they answered me, I was in shock, I totally panicked.
I thought before I was 18, I'd end up on my wheelchair, and before my fifty-five, I'll be dead, and then I'll gradually lose all my powers.
I was totally alone and planned my funeral."
When she was 17 years old, she realized that her ability to walk was not as bad as she thought, and she asked her surgeon.
He just stood up, hugged her and said: “Sweetie, I don’t think you're sick, otherwise you'd be on the wheelchair.
I think it'll be a much less dangerous life."
After a few genetic tests graduated, CMT was found.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a happy child," she said.
The UK charitable organization launched a month of information on CMT to notify this disease.
Businessmen in the area of Washington: taxes are raised with the conversion of the economy
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes, too.
According to a new research published last week, state and local taxation by companies in the country with accelerating economic recovery last year had slightly increased, and companies in Washington were not exceptional.
Investors in Maryland and Virginia, together for the fiscal year 2013, took $27.6 billion to the state and local treasures, which is 3.8% higher than $26.6 billion chosen in 2012.
Tax burdens - state and local - increased by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and was a third growth year after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were reduced.
According to the study carried out by the Ernst & Young professional company and the Political Coordination Centre on State Taxation, government taxes increased faster by 4.3% than local derivatives, by 3.9%.
More than half of the tax revenues of the district, 56%, is from food tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28 %, is proportionately showing the minimum tax revenue from business.
Researchers argue that the majority of the growth in tax revenues comes from an increase in the value of property belonging to companies, which taxes from real estate this year after three years following growth -1 % have increased by 3.7 %.
Although most of the profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same situation is also in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginia paid over $10 billion last year on state and local property taxes, compared with 9.6 billion in 2012, by 4.2% annual increase.
However, the apparent increase in real estate does not so much exercise national and local tax revenues in Maryland, where the property tax represents less than a fifth of company taxes.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the property tax represents almost half of the state and local tax.
“In Maryland, there is a lot of real estate in companies, especially the tax base in the area of D.C., government or non-profit organisation that does not pay taxes”, explained Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on, for example, taxes from income to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
The recent increase in tax revenue from business cannot be assigned only to the recovering market of real estate.
According to the data, business revenues also seem to increase.
Companies in this region have published a tax from $2.3 billion revenue, which increased from 2.1 billion of 2012.
Maryland has chosen a billion dollars, most in the region in taxes from business companies' revenues.
Although they are taken in the same direction, local tax burdens of entrepreneurs do not grow at the same rate in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average level, at 4.3%, while the growth of Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia there was an increase in taxation under the average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest tax of commercial revenues from all three circuits (of which all have the same taxes) 6 %.
Trade companies tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975 %.
Similar studies conducted by the US Trade Chamber this year showed that Virginia has lower national and local taxes and generally more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. did not evaluate.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of southern competition.
North Carolina has recently signed a law to reduce trade tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and the tax will be reduced to 5% next year.
If the revenue objectives continue to be fulfilled in the coming year, the fixed amount of revenue taxation could be reduced to 3 % in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better, so higher government and local taxes are paid.
Animal tax transferred to small businesses as a tax from personal revenues - the structure of compensation for price increases, which organised most companies - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia has increased by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argue that the trend and the national increase in animal tax will likely continue next year, the total tax revenues from the sale for national and local governments will increase to 6.2% in comparison with the same period in the past year of the first three quarters of 2014.
However, Washington can remain behind others because the reduction of state expenditure is choosing its tax on the labour market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putinovo Novorusko and Lafat's scissors
Is there a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for a negotiation on Novorusco
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the south-east of Ukraine, where government units have been encountered with the Prorusian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.

Joan Rivers' family: "We're holding our fingers"
Joan Rivers is unconscious three days since she was brought to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter today said she was not losing hope that the 11-year-old comicle will be healed.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to a rescue service, according to which her heart stop at the yorkwill endoscope in Upper East Side, as the source stated.
The physicians intentionally keep it under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of its state that remains “valuable”.
Reactions did not allow to wait long, including unreal support on the Internet from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rip.
Reality is a screwed title
That the media are screwing the reality with their titles, it is unfortunately no news.
I know the titles "selling" papers, but unfortunately, I also know that many are so-called "readers" who do not read anything else.
And that's the fact that I'm very worried lately, more precise is the word of anger.
This concerns, in particular, the articles on the conflict of Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
It's very common that's the titles "Israel attacked Gaza."
Just in the text you read that Israel's "attack" was the response to burned missiles from the Gaza zone, many times at the time of the circumvention.
Then it will appear the title "Both parties broke the reconciliation."
Does the journalist community realize that this procedure directly participates in antisemits, which are growing in Europe (and not only there)?
It has not been sixty years since the end of World War II.
People who survived Shaw are still alive.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany where the crowd cried out the passwords of the Jewish pigs and similar freaks, I was disgusted.
Is that what the world wants to finish what Hitler didn't do?
Do our journalists realize the fact that after the Jews, they were designed to eliminate the Slovaci?
Ladies and gentlemen, please take a little more care of your work.
You're often labeled "the watch dogs of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of a truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbours decided that the Czech nation would eliminate and remove the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also realize another fact.
Almost 20% of the Arabs with Israeli citizens live in the territory of Israel.
And they're good there.
If you ask them, why don't they go between "they" like Gaza, they'll answer why they would do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security and high health care (I have seen in my own eyes the top private hospital of Hadassa, financed from the Jews' s sponsorships from around the world, normally also the Arabs and are clearly treated there).
Hamas also attacks his Arab brothers with his shots.
The only real help of Gaza, and this disturbing area, is to get rid of Hamas and disarma him.
And not to condemn Israel, be indirectly in the titles.
Inform the practices of Hamas, his abuse of people as human shields.
Notify that Hamas aims to eliminate the state of Israel at any cost.
Even for the death of innocent Arab children.
Notify that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Inform that in nine years of self-government in Gaza this area could be a prosperous area through humanitarian assistance from around the world.
Even from Israel, which delivers water and electricity, for which Gaza managers are not paying and even furious that the supply of electricity is sometimes interrupted.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that suicide attackers could prosecute them in the territory of Israel, but, for example, into the construction of apartment homes, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would live much better.
Amazon buys for $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON has just confirmed the claim from Monday morning: Internet retarder - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys for $1.04 billion (970 million US$) video streaming services Twitch.
The notice has not caused a surprise because no one would expect Twitch to buy, but because it was expected to be a buyer of YouTube.
Three months ago, it seemed to sell Twitche Googlu in a billion sure, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which just three years ago was founded by Justin.tv, was incorporated to become a generally used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it became a fast platform for players who sent online transfers from games - words Business Insider "YouTube for live-translated games".
Interface Twitche.
On YouTube are already popular videos “Let's play”, a type where wise people (a majority elders) give a game of processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube's describing a lot, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch, not much excited, was an example of how the introduced company would pay for possible competition.
The mystery is why the YouTube agreement has not ended, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we now have is the CEO statement of Twitche Emmet Shear: “We have chosen Amazon because he believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us fulfill it faster. ”
Another mystery is - honestly - the incredible success of Twiche.
For snobs like me, who claim that sports are rather doing than watching, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about, games instead of real games just watch.
One thing is to watch at three in the morning a friend over his shoulder playing the Resident Evil, and the whole other thing is to watch someone stranger as he gets twenty hits in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could just look at.
Another problem is that a lot of today's, most popular games are from the perspective of the players, so to look at their records, without you to control the perspective yourself, is a pretty good prescription of how to acquire your heads.
I admit that games of type speed run, in which Rogers Bannisters end the game in the record time, are fun.
But if someone's not a game master or humor, his channel on Twitch is probably not too interesting.
But what does a skeptic like me know about that?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is fourth on the top of the Internet operation.
How exactly will Amazon use that?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch interferes with Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as if it might have swallowed YouTube.
But Twitch has something that would like to attract every company: the hordes of young men they want.
As director Twitche Shear said, Amazon and Twitch “believe in the future of the games” and the media don't seem to be screwed up, nor as - swallowing - audience.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of the American atheist vlogger Aaron Ra.
This time on the subject "Sacred Fonts are God's word."
Attached original video.
The second basic lies to creationism are the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by the real human authors.
When believers debate about one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often ask us: Who will you trust?
To God’s alleged word, or to the word of man?
As if human research was totally vain in comparison with the authority they imagine that he has their doctrine.
Only when they say "man," they're talking about science.
And when they refer to "the word of God", they refer to the myths of the gods of men written.
If there is really an intelligent creator with a purpose, then it is the one who created a fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be the one who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be the one who added a number of other evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of these things.
But people can tell stories, fabulate.
And these were the people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as humans, not gods.
People who were "moving" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or maybe listening to the dictate of angels, but those texts were not written by anyone other than just mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and no more gods.
If there was really one true god, it would be an integral part of all gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the whole space.
If a being of such size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only letter of holy text.
She would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors would not be able to measure such a work.
And people would not have to believe her blindly, because she would be consistent, understood by valid and true evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
She would persistently inspire every reader to the unity of shared faith.
If God wrote it, we wouldn't expect anything smaller.
But what we see instead is exactly the opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without common origin and all are constantly falling apart on increasingly separate denominations, looking for dispute truths, and every way enforcing God’s guidance, regardless of continuing diversity and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Tora, Christian Gospels, Islamic Coran, Baha'u'llah's Kitab-i-Akdas, Zarathustrove Avesty, Sikhski Adi-Granth, Mahabharati Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book Urantia are all considered "Absolute Truth" and "the exposed word of the only true god" and the relevant believers of each of them say that these others are on the ground.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is at a certain level.
None of the above-mentioned books have any advantages against others.
None of them have proof of opposition and no history can be confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at the West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and apologies (defense), because they contain disagreements, absurdities, and primitive ideas considered once true that have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them prosecute awful beasts instead of morality, and many of them argue that they were confirmed by fulfilling prophecy - with each can also contain prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
Foreign theologians admit that all the holy texts of any religion have been written by human hands and thus are subject to interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudice to politically motivated authors, explaining many of the opposition and disagreements in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it opposition, rather comments to each other.
We need to reiterate that we have two different authors, whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author, and it is certainly not by telling an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, i.e. five books of “Mosaic ” and Moses do not authorize any of them, because he almost certainly did not exist as it is described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several mutually unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
Other documents were refilted at the same time and all are assigned to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Scrolls from the Dead Sea are the oldest archaeological findings of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are much younger than the roots of zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Helenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christendom began as a gnostic faith, followed docettes and ebionites and their entirely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in some compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups, such as luciferians, were discredited and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these regulations applies to the king of Ugarit, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Since his followers were a major threat to the young Moses' religion, the authors of the New Law decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebul, "God on the Mount" changed to Belzebub "Pana Much".
So the Bible was deliberately and deceived for both religious and political reasons.
The remaining part of what happened by the New Law was canonized in the fourth century C.E. in a series of committee decisions in Nikai.
Four Gospels were adopted and sixteen others were rejected by a simple raise of hand, as if the fact could be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way the canon developed depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of the day.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in Jerusalem’s Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same accounts of the Gospel.
So the core of the Canon developed from the edge of the original church.
So the Congregation simply accepted any relevant stories between uneducated meats at that time.
However, they consciously took over ten books from the Bible, even though they were referring to books that were approved.
Among the rejected entries, we will find the records of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s word refer to books that are only words of some people and/or are not available anymore?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be approved so if God was the true author of this random mixture of reputation, illustration and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not by too much lighting, rather the opposite!
That's why it's so much of its history content and scientifically completely wrong, whatever it is from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believed that serpents and assholes could talk, believe in spells, bloody sacrifices, ritual spell, charmed objects, fire pills, astrology, and five livestocks of magic.
They thought that if they used a magical stick to squeeze someone with blood, it would cure him from the butterfly.
We're talking about people who thought the rabbits were chewing and the nipples are birds and the whale are fish and drinks that it's a whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cows the slippery patterns, they would be borne by stripped bodies.
How could someone who knows something about genetics say that?
The authors of this book, of course, didn't know.
If the Bible was written by a higher being, it would not contain any mistakes that it contains.
If it came from a pen of really superior creatures and was designed as literal history, then it would not contain anything of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by unscientific and bigotic savages who overlooked or supported cruelty against animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, abuse of children, violence against children, abortions, harassment, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice against race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they do God’s will.
But creatives still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, it must be ignored!
Why?
Because if creatives had no loved books, they wouldn't have a god.
There's the same thing in their world.
It's ironic that they reject God's "work" as "a worship of creation instead of the Creator."
But they themselves consider the word of man as the word of God and the god of themselves, and even insist that their "holy" books have somehow distorted God as such.
Not their version of God, but all the versions of God.
Creational Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, God lies.
They cannot accept that God could exist, and the Bible may be wrong at the same time because they cannot separate the doctrine from the divine.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship human compilations as if these books were a god, because they think they're the word of Jehovah.
But God never wrote or directed any of the records of any religion.
Anything that people approved or rejected in their allegedly "neproper word" of any god, was invented, composed, compiled, translated, interpreted, corrected and often deliberately modified and converted by just missing people.

Apple iCloud reportedly succeeded in hackers, naked images of celebrity
Screenshot with unique files
While an anonymous user on the 4chan server also announces naked pornography of American celebrites, US server Mashable.com noted that.
They are allegedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers where user disabilities have been recorded by automatic backup of iPhone and iPad images.
Apple hasn't spoken to the problem yet.
The part of the celebrite rejects the images as fake, but several of the images have already been admitted.
It belongs to Jennifer Lawrence, known as Katniss in the Hunger Games film series or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in the Death Trap 4.0.
The purpose of the hacker is to use the images and videos obtained to enrich.
The recordings reportedly showed an interest in American magazines, according to the 4chan server reports, but he wants hacker more money than the community.
According to the The Next Web server, it is probably a weakness in iCloud security.
Because a tool on the GitHub server appeared two days ago that allowed the user's accounts to get passwords via a rough force, thus automatic repeat of attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool was proofly working, but Apple closed the safe hole after two days.
However, it is clear that potential attackers had a lot of time to obtain access to different accounts before the publication of this instrument.
The iCloud users should therefore change their password with Apple ID for preventive reasons.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is suitable.
The escape of naked images of celebrites shall be considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers are companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft, secured multiple times better than computers in households or smaller companies, upload sensitive photos in unsafe form of unprotected risk.
If you want to record explicit photos or any other sensitive content, encrypt the files before upload first.
It is also reasonable to set the automatic backup of the photos from the phone so that it runs only on wi-fi and after connection to the charger.
So you will be able to move sensitive images in time "to safety", and mostly you will have space to delete undenied images, so they will not take space in the online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer to HN and IHNED.cz readers in the form of an electronic book from Michal Altaira Valaška in PDF format.
Smart way to save for high school script
Since the price for a high school script for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, an arbitrary student of the second year came with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a book loan system from classmates from high-level students offering nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
"The book for calculations that usually cost $180, I got for a semester for ten and for chicken nugets," said Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He lost 120.
According to the university council, the average student will spend more than $1,200 per year, but students have different options to manage these expenditure.
The preferred choice of students become Internet trades and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
Increasing is renting books, which allows students to use a semester of book, often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc running more than 250 books in campus areas says the lending of books has doubled since 2011.
The review shows that around a quarter of the books in university books were loaned in the last spring semester, says Vice-President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the texts are purchased according to the National Association of University Trade in university books.
Here's 101 of the best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books may be on the Internet by a third of the university books.
The recommended price of the ninth edition of the book “Calculus” of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost 290 dollars, but it is possible on the Internet on Chegg.com, in a retail specialized book, to buy a new $239,99.
Buy Used
If you don't mind the notes of other people or consumption and destruction, the appropriate options are used.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, student of a high school at the Brigham Young University, says that on Amazon.com paid for the used print “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business” 42 cents.
The new one sold himself for $48.
The university teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students in their teachers verify whether older publications are acceptable.
Sometimes changes to work in seminars are not important.
If so, the senior issues can be sold for a fraction of the price of the last version.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, they are also the favorite alternative to buy the books used eBay Inc's Half.com.
Loans
It is also worth considering the lending books, if you treat them well, you do not forget to return them, and you do not need to have them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the new book.
For example, a student could borrow Calculus for about $20 for a semester.
Meet the conditions of trade in which you borrow a book, including a note, emphasis, or use and damage.
Remember: If you do not return the book in time, the penalty may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another possibility is to take care of a normal e-book instead of.
Sometimes these books are basically borrowed in the form of electronic licence valid for a certain period from distributors like Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows "Calculus" for six months in approximately $61.
According to Bracey, the most favourable offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
Anyway, go to the stores.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon enter Pepperdine Law School, recommends to follow the ISBN because it guarantees you buy the right book.
Before you order a book on the Internet, make sure that it is a warehouse, Gault advises.
He made sure of it on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay a full price for a book from the university book.
Blue, blad.
And then they found a torque of guns at the end of the war.
That well stands a little bit away from St. George's church.
We discovered a growing rise around and we started pulling up a summer carriage - approximately a meter and a half mud and a rotten leave.
When we were approaching the day of awkwardness, we hit the head," said Radomil Novak.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up and found that it was a torque of attacking German guns used by SS units.
The finding is allegedly unusual.
According to my information, these guns were made until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novok added.
All wooden structures have been dissolved in time, so it is unusually unused.
Her body is, of course, preserved - keeps her shape.
How did it get in the well?
There's one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units, probably because of fear that they were not displaced.
The fugitive fascists wouldn't do that.
They threw the weapons in the forest," thinks the finder.
The gun was the only thing the enthusiasts from the Spirit of the Jesenists found in the well.
"There might have been hand grenades, those once around a lot, so we slowed down the digging work, we carefully screwed the mud so that there would not be any misfortune, but there was nothing else down there," approached Novok.
The finding ends in the museum depository at the castle in the nearby Slez Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I have not released the Czech captive yet
Exclusive interview Currently.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from captivity of Prorusian separatists.
Kyev/Praha - "Excuse me, I have to take this... calls me from Doneca," he apologized maybe eight times during an exclusive conversation with Currently.cz Ukrainian Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise the Director of the Centre for Liberation of War prisoners.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in television debate.
At each of these interruptions, no names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - which Ruban describes with his restraint at the other end of the phone.
"It's going to be-- go there," he finished one of the lightning discussions with Doneck, and again devoted to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in the backup, a former pilot of the prosecutors and an active participant in anti-governmental protests in Maydan.
Yesterday, when we had a conversation, he was in Doneck.
Liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from capture of Prorusian separatists is devoted to forty-four hours a day.
Currently.cz: You may know that on the side of the Prorusian Separatists, Czechs are also fighting.
Our contraintelligence estimates their number up to thirty.
But there can be even more.
Have you met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have released the captive Serbs, Dagestans, Chechen, one Sweden, a Georgian... but not yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we hit your captive landlord and we can release him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who join Prorusian Separatists and Ukrainian soldiers take them?
They should understand that if they fight in the Ukrainian volunteers and separatists, they will be shot after an interrogation without mercy, as well as any other stranger.
Separatists view these men as mercenaries, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers are captured by a group of dozen separatists - and, therefore, including the Czech Republic - they will settle him behind the nets and treat him as a war prisoner.
This guy's just gonna survive.
The Ukrainian party also acts in war as a state.
And how long have you been able to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand it well, in exchange.
Some sources suggest that it has overstood a hundred men a long time ago.
We've stopped counting how many people we have helped.
But we just released them... we didn't save them from war if they decided to continue fighting.
Savers are doctors in war, surgeons, but we're definitely not.
That's it.
And there's more and more coming every day.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, another four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be a exchange.
Sometimes it's enough for the prisoners to be released and only a human request.
A.cz: It is heard that in a few months, you have gained great authority and even confidence from the Prorusian separatists... as well as the Ukrainian company.
How did you build respect for both warfare parties?
It's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "the crazy general with the steel balls."
It doesn't bother me.
And maybe that's the point of our work.
As the chief of the Ukrainian Officer, I have received some authority before.
I'm never smart, I don't cheat and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and speak the truth.
Even when it's Ukrainian government, or the homeland or luhanian, it's very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I just tell them they're torturing and killing.
And they're crimes.
I'm often risking my life, even in the exchange of prisoners, and I've been captured... this job can be the end for me any time... I don't have to come back.
A.ch: How many executions and torture of prisoners do you know?
... (long silence)... to torture captives during the interrogations, Ukrainians and separatists are dismissed.
Unfortunately.
What about the execution?
They're only on the household side.
That the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners, I have no information.
Not even suggests that the Ukrainian army is allowed to do something like that.
We have an idea about the quantity of executions, but I can't specify numbers and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe me the characters and motives of Prorusian separatists.
There are officers among them, but even veterans from Afghanistan.
They're trying to make an independent and maybe even democracy in Doneck or Luhansk - at least that's what they say.
They don't want to play any more games with Ukrainian oligarches.
Separatists already have oligarches full of teeth and are their imminent opponents - to life and to death.
As we say, they ate them to the throat.
The same dreams and desires people showed, by the way, the Maidan.
And now I speculate: Russia supports separatists, and the West is the Ukrainian state.
I think one speculation is big and the other is small.
It's my sentence, but it's hiding an unconditional dispute in it.
A.cz: How, for example, do you see one of the strongest leaders of the Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of war front, I am without weapons and I show soldiers or armsmen shaved naked hands.
And I'm always in both sides of these two hundred or three hundred meters on the mushroom or the optical focuser.
Those faces of people who point at me every time I see well... and they can press their weapons.
Experiencing colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
It is considered to be a Russian officer, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small governor in the big Russian empire.
In any case, they keep talking about it and Ukraine considers some misunderstanding.
That state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an immigrant enemy of all Ukrainian oligarches.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in the debate show of Ukrainian TV, you've named your Prime Minister Arsenia Jaceňuk a weak, helpless and tired "lider", which would do the best if he quickly left.
For these three hundred feet of walk, I'm always scared at least five times.
So why should I hide with the opinion that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and harms our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainian Jaceňuka called the rabbit.
And the rabbit is not a animal in the eyes of the Ukrainians who would be afraid of or should have respect and authority in others.
His behavior directly copys the rabbit's behaviour.
He may be a good economist, but as a prime minister, he has no right to cry in the parliament, beg him, play with him his intrigues, threaten to put his functions... he has to drive the country, manage it, and during war and protect it.
In the threat of the country, the prime minister has no right to family, friends, rest for crying emotions.
He is the first of Ukrainian ministers.
What about Jaceňuk?
She's acting like a puberty girl.
Yes, he's tired, but also weak, because he's never been strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why Galaxy Guards couldn't save markets
Postport 3 Sylvester Stallone returned from the 90 million budget in the United States less than $30 million and Sin City: a woman for which I would kill from the 70 million budget only 12 million.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz earned only $14.6 million during the first weekend and films for children like How to train dragon 2 were disappointed for the movies.
According to the article of the film criticism Robbie Collin in Telegraph, children's movies are responsible for their own quality.
Collin marked 2014 as the "worst" year of child movies and How to train a dragon 2 called just "functional" continuation.
When films are put on a little older target group, it seems that the problem must not be in the quality of the movies itself.
In July, he compared Entertainment Weekly servers of CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average summer film premiers sent in at least 2,000 movies between the Day of War and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of the audiences and the film critics suggest that this year's film fertility is similar to the quality of last year's hits.
According to some comments, change in the access of the viewers and higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix may be guilty.
The director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's processing of the Jungle Book, told Hollywood Reporter's website: “I think the time is changing.”
We have to admit it and not try to pursue what's already been.
Unlike the current crisis of the Hollywood Casovers, Netflix gained profits through the Internet services of $1.2 billion, which is almost twice the $837 million last year.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised the study for being too relying on the rights to comic books, and foretold the "break" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current failure, some commentators declare that there may be something at its catastrophe.
In the summer 2015, the possible large carriers, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoni and the Yurian world, are more optimistic in the film industry.
Producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently marked the decline in sales simply as a "cyclic". For Hollywood Reporter said: "The next summer will be the biggest scaffolds in history and no one will worry about sale."
KLDR threatens Saul again, launched another missile of short-range
North Korea exploded another missile in the sea, said Soul.
The alleged missile test has been performed shortly after the completion of the joint military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pchjongjang considers as invasion preparation.
The Province Chagang is located in the northwest of KDLR at the borders with China.
The speaker of the South Korean Ministry of Defence according to the DPA Agency stated that the bullets were fired from the northwest of KLDR and flew to a distance of about 200 miles.
The North Korea has apparently first launched a missile from the Chagang province, the South Korean media introduced with an appeal to military circles.
The province says there is an underground flamming ramp for Scud-type missiles.
It is another of the series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has performed in the past weeks.
North Korea has performed uncommonly large numbers of missiles and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, the protests of the opponents of the NATO summit in Newport took place.
Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in Newport Centre to attend the NATO march.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the Council in Cardiff for a meeting that was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough was watching the situation during the weekend and spoke to the protesters who traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers must have been air transported from Blue Mountains
Two young tourists were picked up by a plane and transported to safety after they spent the night in Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
Sixteen - year - old girl and 18 - year - old man went to Govets Leap in Blackheath after Sunday afternoon.
When they didn't come home, the alarmed relatives called the police around 8:00.
The search units, including the local police and the rescue team, were sent, and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11:00 at night.
The girl wounded her knee and the man fell and hit her head.
The cops stayed with them overnight and were picked up Monday morning.
In a stabilized state, the ambulance was transported to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought from Opava only a point, he had a victory on your foot
Just a 23-year-old Forward could have decided, but in two largest chances, he failed.
After the naked, three minutes before the end, it ended up at the Opava brana Josef Flower.
I had it on my leg. I have to give that chance.
I'm mad at myself," your chicken's ashes on his head.
"I guess I should've put it above the violin, it's a little bit messed up," he said.
Sigma defensive did not allow Opava much, except Mikula's 11-minute invasion, but covered by the golman Reichl.
Then the Hanacas started pushing them, but they weren't in the block defenceing their home, and the bullets from the distance caught the flower.
Fifteen minutes we compared, then we took the initiative.
In the second half time, we were better, we had more of the game, and Opava only threatened us with standard situations.
But the exposed chance of your baby didn't change, so it ended 0:0," the coach of Hanak Leosz Kalvodu hated.
The Opava point was also due to absence in the composition, where Peter Vavrik, with a three-gole shooter, Peter Shevczyk, who hosted from Sigma in Slezland.
It did not allow them to enter, in contrast with its previous policies.
The substitutes deserve the absolution.
Sigma worked more soccer, but we didn't let her do anything but one standard," said Coach of Slezs Peter Baranek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression, and fighting.
Remisa is probably deserved, the point is a good profit for us," he added.
Sigma has reached four points, which means the thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the boss of the Joseph Lebra club, who, after defeat, contracted his million contribution to the treasure diameterally different performances in the other matches.
"We realized the warning of Mr. Lébra, so there cannot be a word that the boys would not want to fight," Calvoda noticed, and at the address of the sleeping shooter, Yourie said, "I believe it will come and when he gives it a goal, it will start falling there.
But after the first strike, I'm gonna get him right away to save the goals for another fight," Calvoda laughed.
Al Pacino enthusiasmed the Beneficiaries twice.
The Film Festival has a crisis differently
After a huge enthusiasm on the Birdman starting film, whose director Alejandro Gonzalez Injaritu was incorporated in a slightly serious candidate for the Golden Lions, the other days suggested that the interest in the 71st year of the festival in Benátki was somewhat falling.
Whether either because the number of places in the largest hall increased to 14 hundred or because Birdman followed criticisms recognised, but less attractive images for the viewers as a document on genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s in view of silence and other social topics from the American 99 homes to the Iranian Stories, simply remained empty seats in the movies.
Heroes of comic books
Even a red carpet in front of the Festival Palace has not been placed in the past, and it has reportedly stopped to be a problem to gather a place in the hotel at the last moment.
The crisis is discussed in Italy more than anywhere else, and it is no wonder that it has been affected by both important institutions like Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personality, but only in relation to movies.
While the younger fans wanted autographs of comic superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who have successfully played dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations, no difference was the main event to visit a legendary actor Ala Pacina.
He lighted up here in two movies.
In the story of the Provision indicated outside the contest, filmed by Oscar Barry Levison according to the romans of Philip Roth, the fourty-seventh-year-old Pacino role that is close to him: the actress on the top of the glory that suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as a freaking iron owner from the rural town in Manglehorn, filmed by David Gordon Green, it was a really unforgettable experience.
Volpi's cup for the best acting performance should not be missed - but does Pacin's artist still need prices?
It may be the greatest satisfaction of the audience to him, and the Italian especially, for even though he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the land from which his grandparents come from.
Bodys for Italy
Otherwise, Italian movie is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became the first picture of Birdman rewarded by a long applause.
Calabrian mass of the mafia is observed in it by the view of family relations between clans that fight each other for power and money, and the director was able to harmonize all the predictions for a good movie: quality scenario, camera, music and actors.
He also took the chamber psychothriller Hungary Heart that filmed Saverio Costanzo with Ilia Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost lost his own child.
On the contrary, the French competitive films did not await warm acceptance, nor the Redemption for glory, nor 3 hearts, both workes failing on the traditional model of consumming films based on the popularity of actors' representatives.
But after all, two really excellent movies, Birdman and Black souls, are not so small for the first half of the festival.
And even if the festival images have a universe of depressive subjects, a new picture of Peter Bogdanoviche called She's Funny That Way, a fun comedy listed in the Venice outside the competition and filmed in the style of American cheerleaders in the 40s, it was able to raise the mood for more than one day.
Policemen caught four pervitine producers in Prague, medication from Poland.
"The detectives detained three men in the past days, aged 42, 42 and 37 and a fifty-year-old woman, who made and sold pervitations from last November to August this year," said police spokesman Jan Rössler.
First, on Tuesday, August 12th, the intervention unit in the Cihlary Street caught a 24 - year - old organizer and a dealer in one person and a young woman who in the group used as a buyer of drugs in Poland and a dosage seller.
The next day, the detectives detained on the basis of the previous consent of the State Representative of the next member of the group, a seventy-year-old man.
The last of the four police were caught in the middle of the morning 20th August in the area of small fuel," the speaker described.
A woman received a third of drugs for the transport of drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a wide field of action.
In the summer area, in a garden house in Horemirik, in the apartment in Konjevo Street and in other places in Prague 9, he produced pervitations, provided various supplies and chemicals needed for its production and provided for the transport of medicinal products with pseudoefedrin from the Poland.
Furthermore, he weighed, divided into plastic bags, and then selling pervites.
With the transport of drugs from Poland or sale to drugs, he was helped by a fifty - twenty - year - old woman who had not yet been punished.
For that, she received a remuneration from the organizer in the form of a third of the drugs produced," Rössler added.
Criminalists also conducted several home surveys, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, pay bags, syringes, syringes and other devices, which, according to experts, can be considered complete equipment for the production of metamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995.
"Of the available records then the police found that the chief organizer has been seven times sentenced for property criminal activity since 1995, the woman has not been judged," complemented the police speaker.
Last detained in 2006 was conditionally convicted for a sexual abuse crime and a seventy-year-old automechanist who was persecuted on liberty has been sentenced nine times judicially since 2009.
And it was mostly for his property criminal activity.
The investigator accused three men and women of criminal offence of unauthorized production and other charges with deceptive and psychotropical substances and poisons, for which they are threatened by ten years of imprisonment.
In three persons, the investigator eventually filed an invitation to a proposal for detention where the judge eventually placed them," the speaker said.
The fourth accused, the seventy-year-old reiterator, ended up on freedom.
His position and role in this case were not as important as others accused.
The cops are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess from wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products for very "interesting" prices.
As a good example, for example, in Italy manually made chess with a playboard size of 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, prepare for more than 40,000 CZKs.
The exact price is 43,405 Kč.
The customer gets a set of wooden black and red lactated figures stored in a wooden box covered by carbon fibres.
No one may be surprised that the players are available to a lifting horse instead of a classic rider.
If the chess does not seem to be a sufficiently valuable gift, you also need Ferrari 500 F2 model produced (approximately manually) in measure 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 Kč.
Disturbing high schools and high schools doesn't make sense.
Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics also show that high schools have good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
In schools in the last 14 days, great preparations have been conducted.
Mostly, it's about routine matters, such as bringing flowers from the summer storage back to classes and facing creeds.
They're going to have a little bigger from at the mountain high school.
A few days before the season, they are searching for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature to the library.
There was no robbery or fraud, the four-year high school in Goriki after three years, opening and renewing its activities.
Not in public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not caused by the founders being so unable.
They must have waited for the existence of the school to be confirmed by bringing the school register of the managed MSMT.
"French socialists should shut up and put France in order," said the key ally to Francoise Holland
Valls calls on a strongly broken left to show its support to a warly-styled socialist president whose new division of functions did not meet with the consent of the majority of French.
The president deserves universal respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by him," he said, and he crushed the applause.
As a consolidating gesture, the President of the Government insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-fifth-hour working week, despite enthusiasms by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who proposed that the rules be released at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Holland asked socialists to remain "consistency" with the government.
Christiane Taubir, the Minister of Justice, but made him a line over the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel socialist Members, where the Socialist Party criticised for “Francouz lost faith in the future” because of it.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of extremely conservative right, has been laughing at the constant internal disputes between socialists when she declared that she does not assume that the new government of Valles will last for more than a few months.
The empire Francois Hollande is naked, and Prince Manuel Vals also. They were forced to build a new government when the previous did not hold it by the end of the summer.
"And the new one will not end the autumn or winter," Le Pena said to her favorites.
She reiterated its party's call for dissolving Parliament and said she was convinced that the party could win early elections and is ready to drive the country.
The French Ruling Party suffered a defeat in March's municipal elections and in May, the extremely conservative right has successfully made elections to the European Parliament.
According to the study of the public opinion of Journal du Dimanche, 76% of the French believes that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of dividing into several competitive fractions before the end of the Dutch Functional Period in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, politist of the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French will soon be patient if the new socialist government cannot improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It is a limited area for opportunity, but public opinion must think there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art are not limited to the elections
The amendments to the relevant declarations should prepare and approve the new leadership of the capital.
The streets of Prague will not disappear from the municipal elections and the city will not limit street art.
There won't be a dog's wedding.
The threshold will not be made to the October elections to prepare and approve the amendment of the relevant declarations.
"The decision on changes should also not be done by the current leadership of the city ending within a few weeks of mandate," Councilman Luke Manhart (TOP 09) said.
In the past weeks, several councils, such as Pragues 5 and 7.
Herny's not gonna disappear. The gambling's not going to change yet.
It's a task of new city leadership after elections.
We wouldn't even get this technically now, for example, with regard to the time limits for comments and likewise," Manhart explained.
He added that the last negotiations of the current representativeship, which must be approved, shall be implemented on 11 September.
The general gambling ban referendum is scheduled on the day of the municipal elections of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
For example, the prohibition of gambling is currently paid in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The statement will not be changed for the same reasons even in the case of street art, so-called Busking.
In particular, Prague 1 complains on this, which has already sent the magistrate a proposal for places to expand the current list of prohibited sites.
The musicians also don't want Prague 5 in the surroundings of Angel.
The statement regulating the dog's settlement is about to be made for a few months, yet not completed.
The location of herens and the problem of the busking deals with the city's statements.
It can only issue or edit the representation of the capital city.
The council's only got an advisory voice, and they can't make their own statements.
Last week, he placed the victory to the Scottie's independence at the reach of his hand
The Scotland Campaign for Independence was in danger to make this mistake the first time when she almost placed on the billboards all over Scotland's question whether Scotts want to be rich.
But you can't get to the hearts of the Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, or even obtaining their respect when you start threatening them.
The moral of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, even though few Scots are still going to church today.
Scots have a far greater tendency to expel alternators from the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
The chief of Scots nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and he repeatedly asked his rival, unionist Darling, if he was willing to respect the "suvereign will of the Scotland people" if the Scottish voters voted for independence and started supporting the single currency for Scotland and England.
This made Darling vote between the Scotland civil society and the London funds, and he fell into this trap with the grimas.
Of course, Darling won't support the mandate of the Scottish voters.
However, the debate on what Scotland will have currency has been largely neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and protection of state health, which citizens have free.
Darling supported the London bankers in the currency matter and also made the impression that he would not protest against privatization of health.
As Salmond said, "he got into bed with conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that the Scottish businesses are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to the voters in Scotland, but to the Association of the Boss, to the British Industry Confederation.
It is clear that Cameron's refusal to discuss independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a coward absent home.
Scotts would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scott Prime Minister.
Cameron could at least say that Scotland could be "successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain for him.
What he tells is clear: Scots should not jump out and have to accept what it is.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pesimistic start of school according to Miloše Urbana
Illustration to the story The longest year
Miloš Urban Longest Year
The end was the best of the holidays, the last week that was gone to nowhere, and we were just screwing up and running with Grandma's summer, silence before the storm, calm before stress.
New clothes, when they were able to get from Tuzex, boots from East Germany.
Reading Quick Arrows, already the fifth, whistling on a bike around the Empire to the back of Vary, somewhere to the tennis coats, no more hot, the sun was smoothing back and shoulders, screaming the rays on the farewell.
Evening mild nerve, still holiday regime, sleeping until half eleventh, in a week it will be worse, a moment before falling asleep will go from a few minutes to two hours, then wake up at half seven in the morning.
It'll be Monday.
Mostly, it's not raining, on the contrary, the summer is crushing in front of school.
To join in a ghost light on the plates and feel like a plastic set in a glass weight, there's the school, the D.S.A.
He's a witch with a creepy pink bark, and the old famous faces and a couple of new boys, more squeezed, girls more breasty.
That's where the bastards are, they're avoiding, they're as interesting as they keep together and how soon they're here.
And these adult girls who came up screaming, now they're hysterically laughing, probably something changed in their life over the holidays, while everything's old with me.
And the new firsts, some nervous and other pleasures, why are they even climbing here?
Because it has to, the educational war is obliged.
So inside, the cold moisture of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned student with the mope, unfortunately the same thing that he says lends to the student the keys from the belly box where they can leave the books and which are still so few.
For a bottle.
The smell of dress remains in memory, now it doesn't get out, it's pretty exhausted, but it's gonna be worse in a week.
It's just the idea that the stomach is screwing and the head starts to hurt.
The head that takes the lesson from mathematics, the devil's games for the elected, between which I don't belong and never will.
Again those threes and fours, don't take care of fives, hide from testing, fall into the bench, and best exploit, be there and not to be there, exist only as a name in the classroom, and dream stories about sweeter girls and nice buildings, about the antennas to the universe, where no one is competitive, humiliated and humiliated by no one.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now like years ago.
She let her daughters die.
She's threatened with a special punishment - News.cz
The first birth occurred in March 2012 in the public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without foreign help, a girl was born, which, after cutting the puppy, put her in a prepared blanket, she hid under her bowl and took her to the road trail, where she was put to the heats of tens of meters away from the road.
She was born on her way to school
It came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
I needed to go to the toilet in the bus, where I was born.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the puppy rope with the scissors I was wearing at school," she described the defendant and said she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to the place, she put the body of her child in her bag and took her body out of her bag, packed her in the black bag and hid her and left her grandmother in the house at Hawlicov Brod," she claimed that it was not completely obvious when the newborn died.
It could have been in ten minutes, but even a few hours after birth, choking at covering the blanket or putting under the jacket, cooling or bleeding from an unlinked puppet.
A similar scenario was repeated next year in spring.
A woman nearly undetected from February to April 12, when the child's dead body was found by random witnesses in the pond at Haljičkobrodsk, she was still secretly born.
This time in the bathroom of the undercover apartment in the family house.
Without verifying whether it was born alive, without cutting and bonding the puppy around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic packs, including the igelite bag, and left it in the bathroom.
In the afternoon, he and his partner then took him to the pond.
Finally, a friend gave her up.
The father of both children was just a friend of the accused, but he reportedly didn't know the partner's pregnancy.
Even for that reason he is not in court now, he was only punished for a sin against the funeral law.
It was also the one who turned to the police later.
I don't like him being punished as a colleague.
He manipulated the child against my wish.
I know that my solution was not right, but it came to me at that time as human," she did not hide the oppression of the accused who reportedly subjected and feared him.
During her testimony, a young woman spoke relatively balancedly.
She had tears in her eyes until the moment she talked about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after her age.
She didn't want to kill
"He's driving to visit me every 14 days, doing everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she cried.
I didn't get an equipment because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I wanted to put him in the babybox, but I don't know what happened, I didn't do it.
I can't explain that to you," she answered the question of the judge.
However, she refused to act with reason and intention of killing a newborn.
Another child, according to her claim, was born dead.
Even in pregnancy, she didn't stop drinking alcohol.
But I've limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I also limited smoking," she said.
Although pregnancy was seen in both cases, she claimed to all on repeated questions that she had health problems, that she was induced.
And that's my friend.
The main trial will continue on Tuesday in the court of Castle with the statements of judicial experts.
Wednesday could be sentenced.
The woman is threatened by a criminal rate of up to 18 years of imprisonment, if possible by a special punishment.

Pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong are provoked by Chinese authorities
Nearby, a group of people loyal to Beijing, who had a Chinese flag.
The Standing Commission of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates attend the elections in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive support from the appointment committee, which is likely to be composed of members of the faithful Peking.
Because of this decision, opposition democrats are almost impossible to get on election tickets and force for democratic activists to renew their promises and reinforce Hong Kong's financial centre protests "Central Occupation".
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tension, Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democracy will extend to other cities.
After Beijing published in June a detailed report on Chinese official authority in Hong Kong, democratic activists arranged an unofficial referendum on elections in the special official area and hundreds of thousands of people entered the city's business quarters and took it.
The press conference held by Prime Minister Li is organized by the Government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Contact Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission of Zhang Ronghsun and the Deputy Director of the National Council for Affairs of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei were also discussed at several press conferences.
Student activists declared that the afternoon would be gathered before the Hong Kong government's office.
Until the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain has never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin requests Kyev to start negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on “State Sovereignty”
According to the Russian newspaper's description on Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop the fight against separatists in the east of the country and immediately launch the negotiations on the "State sovereignty" of the disbanded areas.
His speaker Dmitri Peskov later explained that Putin had no intention of implying his note that the areas of Eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reconsidered to allow the Russian speaking area to receive the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putina's call to the Kyev government to deal with the prorusian rebels as equal to itself corresponds to the obvious strategy that is followed by the explosion of anxiety five months ago: Help separatists to take the territory and make the Ukrainian government give a real independence to Novorusko, which is now announced, so that the place with the West can be connected to Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of state television, Putin condemned Ukrainian military action to regain the eastern areas of Donecka and Luhansk, which were controlled by separatists in March and April after Moscow analyzed the Crim Polyostroves belonging to Ukraine on 18 March.
Kreml and separatists have recently known the newly occupied territories as “Novorusko” or “New Russia” as a term that refers to the famous prerevolutionary days of the Russian empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass published Putin's words, according to which the “illus prisoner” is all those who believe that there are peaceful negotiations on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians began before the parliamentary elections on October 26, while government units attack civilians in the areas of controlled separatists.
"In the interest of people living in these areas, we must immediately launch meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and the statute of state sovereignty in the southeast of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putinov's implication on state sovereignty was thought in the context of a wider autonomy, which has been dealt with with the leadership of Kyeva for months and which is to mitigate the fears of Russian speaking areas of the threats of cultural and language rights.
Peskov stated that the necessary autonomy can only the Ukrainian government grant the eastern area.
It is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The progress of the speaker Kreml, which was to correct the “wrong interpretation” of Putin’ notes, emphasized the approach of Russia to address the rebellion of separatists in the east, which is different from the open-up of the Crime, where most of the two-million populations of origin are allocated to the ethnic Russians.
Moscow should also analyze Doneck and Luhansk in the east of Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not the Russians and the public opinion surveys that took place before the conflict have shown wide support for the continuation of Ukraine.
Autonomy that the Russian diplomats have acted in international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and in fact to give Kremlu actual control over the territory that would link the Russian land with Crime.
The Black Sea Polo islands analysed five months ago is the seat of the main Russian maritime fleet, the marine trading land and the historic coastal resorts.
Areas between Russian Rostov and Crime are also a centre down, factories and slippers that produce important components for the Russian army.
The Ukrainian President Petro Porošenko, during his inauguration speech of June 7th, proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give more control to the various regions of their finances and language statutes.
But this vision of autonomy is much different from the vision of Kremlu and Separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putinov's last challenge to treat Kyev separatists as the same as follows after the next rebel procedure last week after Russian units and tanks crossed Eastern Ukraine from a quiet area along the Asian Sea.
Separatists strengthened by the Russians have taken control of Novoazov so much that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that it is aimed at pursuing strategic coastal territories until Crim.
This has succeeded in a huge civil and military effort to reinforce Mariupol, a port with metalurgical compartments of 500,000 inhabitants, which lie between Novoazovska and the narrow gate on the Crim Polo island.
On Saturday, the complainant spoke to the European Union's leading representatives in Brussels and encouraged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," warned Poušenko.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - the leaders call for further sanctions against Russia in the event of a closer unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday, told the reporters in Kijev that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovia after the last week two columns of Russian defence vehicles and 1,000 military units entered the Donetsk area to support surrounded separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in Ilovia during the Russian invasion were replaced on Sunday with 10 Russian landers captured in Ukraine a week ago, stated on Sunday Lysenko.
The scandal with discovered photos also includes Australian celebrites and Gabi Greece
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgusting over hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Greece and other influenced Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after the biggest scandal with hacked photos of the celebrity got on the Internet series of explicit photos naked by Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker claims that he has sixty photos with the naked star Hunger Games Lawrenc and other stars, including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michelle and her actress Kirsten Dunst.
The iCloud's escape was also reportedly accompanied by personal photos of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Greece.
There's 101 celebrites on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greece for hand last month, said to the Confidential magazine: “It's disgusting.”
All private correspondence and all private pictures should remain private.
It's a shame that personal information can be stolen and extended to the public.
Greece, who is now in New York, according to online journal rapporteurs, has reported that hacking is "unshy" and those who have become its targets are "consuming humiliation".
It's considered that hacker got 30 photos of Palmer with a former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures on which he's blown up at the pool.
Palmer, for example, worked in the Love and Honour film, where she was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the Chuck Strahovski TV series and the actress from the Sucker Punch Browning thriller yesterday did not comment on the stolen images.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said: “It is a clear violation of privacy. ”
Herec Seth Rogen hackera on his Twitter criticised: “Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods. ”
In legal terms, the release of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Footballists Sigmy welcomed Lébra, even without winning
Olomouc - Groms and lightnings that the Oloma's owner Joseph Lébr sent to his subject last week, are, seem, past.
They've finally brought from Opava only a point for the wreckless remise.
By putting and fighting the club boss, they just made a little good.
Money for payments could come to the club soon.
"I keep another match as I spoke about last week, but I'm far more optimistic," Lebr confirmed that despite the fact that Sigma didn't win, the players convinced him with improved performance.
The fighting and laying with which we played mainly in the second half of time was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive that he won't win.
If we played this from the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we haven't lost yet," Lebr thinks.
Sigma in Opava stopped initiating domestic pressure, then balanced the game, and in the second half it was better.
After the victory of Calvod, the trustees touched, but they couldn't get their options to the naked, so they couldn't win.
The result is not according to our ideas.
We missed the full satisfaction but only one changed chance," said Lebr, who does not think that the change in football player's access caused only his threat.
There must have been more aspects.
Anyway, from my side, from the coach, or the fans," said Lebr.
Sigma must count with pressure
The players didn't want to comment on the last week after the game in Opava.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
I tried not to accept it," the young Branchman Michal Reichl shook his head.
In full without comment, he left a question about Lebrova's statement last week from the attacker Václav Vášček, who did not change Sigma's greatest opportunity in the Saturday match.
But it was just a little bit about the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to get on us.
Today we showed that if we were to fight and ride the ass, it would be possible," he said.
They took warnings to their hearts
Even the coach Leosz Kalvoda did not pretend that the preparation for the game was not the easiest atmosphere in Olomouca last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that the warning of Mr. Lebra was taken to heart.
Even before, it wasn't about not fighting and disturbing it," said the Olomouch coach.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It took us to compare with the hardship and to realize what the other league was about.
That it's not just about football, it's mainly about the fight," Kalvoda said.
There's nothing left to hope that Sigma's next matches will work from the beginning.
"I'd love to believe it," he added.
