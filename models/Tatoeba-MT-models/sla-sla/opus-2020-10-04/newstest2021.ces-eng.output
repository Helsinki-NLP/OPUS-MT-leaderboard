A well-closed cave in the forest in New Bor was actually not a resident.
In the northern Czech undergrounds of the Lužical Mountains, near the New Bor in Czech Republic, in the forests led by the County Road, several sand rocks are hiding.
Natural and artificially created.
And we're going to go behind that human hand created.
The place is called the cave in the desert.
But in fact, there was never a desert who lived here and a cave served as a shelter, more precise hiding chamber, apparently on grain.
The cave is drawn from the side to the rock caution and accessible on the stairs above.
But it's almost not seen until the last minute.
It will be released to the narrow stairs leading to a rock gallery from where it is just entering the rock.
Even though the chamber seemed to be far away from human residences, it could have been on the upper plane where the forest is today.
"The fact that this object does not have a window and even in the traditional location of the tower, clearly proves that no vaulter here could ever survive the winter," explains historian Camil Podrožek from the Philosopical Faculty of John Evangelists Purkina in Usto nad Labe.
The one-space object only has a stone bench that is clearly served for disposal of containers.
"I see it as a storage chamber of some food or products from the field," Camille's supplies.
There are signs of tools on the cave walls.
The breaking of the sand with a peak was quite simple and fast for the dedicated one.
All we needed to do was use the swimming and the sand plumming gradually.
According to the length of the track of the peak and any way of cutting, the period of cave can be fixed in a framework.
According to historian, it's probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the mess that appears in it, there are sometimes sleeping in today’s day.
If you approach the cave from one of the forest roads and take you under the cave of the flowing streams and the nearest railway, you will surely find the path down.
And on the way out of the woods, you may still be caught by the nearby hawran rocks.
Joki Minarik is after a severe fall in Germany in artificial sleep
"Philip is now in the best hands.
The Institute is arranged for similar cases, and, fortunately, we have a part of the family in Hannover.
This makes me considerably easier and also care for Finn's daughter," the server Jezdici quoted.cz the statement of Minarik's wife, Katji.

Philip is a great warrior.
We all need to be patient now and give him time," said a woman of 45-year-old jokey.

Video Judge took Sassuola Footballers four goals, lost 0:2
The footballists Sassuola, at the Saturday match in Neapol, got four times into the competitive branch, but eventually they had to reconcile with defeat 0:2.
None of their goals judged after consulting the video because of the side.
According to the Italian media, it's a record of technological adverseness, so many interferences have never been scattered to one team.
"VAR was more strict to Sassuolo than a road radar and punished him as no team yet.
New technology breaks records," Gazzetta list dello Sport wrote in comment.
"The festival of unrecognised goals of Sassuola.
VAR has never been so strict to one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Neapol took the lead on Saturday in eight minutes, after half an hour of the game, but it seemed Sassuolo balanced.
Phillip Djuričić's goal was not recognised after the video judge was invaded because of the site.
For the same reason, no other Djurich's intrusion and hits of Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi were gradually paid.
On the contrary, they added one more goal.
Electromobiles report a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they were most in history
"The growth took both 30 per cent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent loading in public stations, and the accelerate development of new e-auth registration," said the chief of the Clean Technology Office CHEZ Tomasz Chmelik.
Other large players, such as PRE and E.ON, producer of Tesla's electrical vehicles, are also reported on the market, but also the supermarkets of Bill and Lidl.
Classical pumping station operators are represented by MOL.
But it doesn't have any numbers yet.
"Our electromobility network we have only started building the year," Jan Juskov spokesman explained.
However, the revision of Dennik exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stands operated by the CEZ.
It turns out that the drivers from the stations were taken in an average of 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the arrival of approximately 100 miles of smaller electromobile.
If we skip a tiny drawing to 1 kWh, the average loading lasts two and a half hours.
The vulnerable majority of tanking then took place in a free tariff.
If the engineers were already paying for receipt, their typical loss was about 330 crowns.
Electromobility is mainly in the capital.
In the territory of Prague, all five of the most exhausted CEZ winners are located, which also shade their popular cities in the region.
Then Olomouc leads between the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is the distant station in the border, such as in Godmin or in Praghatic, which often remains all day without use.
More than four thousand electromobiles are currently registered in Czech Republic.
Only in this year's first semi-year, 1274 new e-auths arrived.
In an extensive "Cheche in Movement" survey, eight percent of the readers indicated that the purchase of electric vehicles into the family was considered.
But only one third of the respondents know where to find the nearest charge station in their neighborhood.

It stated that the main requirements of the protesters are the creation of a plan for the detention of water in the country, agricultural change and a subsidy system towards supporting sustainable agricultural development and as soon as possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is to protect the interests of people, not the improper and destructive business," she said.
On the Mallateral Square, a petition of the Czech State called for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the renewal of Czech soil and land.
The present people were equipped with passphrases such as "The end of the depth of the rape" or "Mini carbon, more boats".
From South Morava to Prague, John Škoda came from the Communities for water for people who protested against the plan of harvesting the verkopies in Hodoninia.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the gardens represent the fifth most expensive source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned harvest of the crushcopy is only approximately 500 meters from the gardens, and it is estimated that the quality of water will be threatened.

The owner is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is the key player on the bank market in Central and Eastern Europe.

Most of the disease is mild, only three percent of the infected must be in the hospital.
Either the slighter form of coronavir is spread by Czech Republic, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved our immunity.
The infectious hospital department is half empty, even if the numbers infected are increasing.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is given primarily by the number of hospitalized," confirms Minister for Health, Adam Vojtech.
It is worth reminding us that when the first wave of the epidemic came to us on 11 April, all the guns were wearing, the army was collected, the Republic was closed and the Czech Republic consumed disinfection for a year ahead.
Still, ten people died a day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with covid-19 dies at least two people.
The highest number of infected populations has still Karvin, similar numbers Jihlava has already had because of the fire in the local Alzheimer Centre, where 57 are already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for seniors has been closed with hygienics in Montenegro at the King's Garden.
The disease confirmed the tests with one of the nurses.
"We're traumatic, we've limited movement, we have all hygienic measures," said Martin Schanel, director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the home clients have any symptoms of disease yet.
The worst testing will begin to perform hygiene tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
The increased number of infected patients also respond to hospitals.
The Oncological Institute in Brna launched today an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people have a rifle at the entrance.
The record is reported by the Southern Hygienics who have recorded the fifty-fifty cases of coronavir -- most of them are foreign employees of the money company.
The total arrived on Saturday 131 infected - so half of the Friday number - but less tested for the weekend.
The debutty champion!
Van Day Bergh wrote a story, Andersona was a garbage.
The great surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh showed an excellent performance even in the fight with the player, which the second most prestigious company in the PDC won in 2018.
The introduction of the match was mutually balanced, the fracture came at state 8:7 for the Belgian arrow.
Van Day Bergh took his ear with a 13-school leg, and he had the top since then.
He literally smashed his competitor's game and significantly more experienced "Flying Scot" just hard to get to the doubles.
The way he had the "Sleep Creator" in his throat, also testifies that the distracted Anderson played his first maximum until 24th leg.
Furthermore, a young Belgian man managed great high checkouts.
Last time he was losing in the eleventh leg, in an inadverse state, but "he caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, there was a huge frustration in Anderson.
He was rather throwing the arrows and his triumph walking rival began completely sovereign.
Van day Bergh changed the first of three matches of darts and got his name - he wrote his great dream.
The profit of a trophy named by Phil Taylor is more valuable for the Belgian arrow to be his first winner major.
It still pays so much that the last player who was able to defeat the van day of Bergh was Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes, the fire of the cathedral, the man confessed
Saint Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes started burning last Saturday, and the fire seriously damaged the original vitrage windows of the 16th century and destroyed the wargans.
The suspects of the burning were checked because the fire went through the temple from three different places.
At the same time, the police didn't find any signs of getting into the cathedral by violence.
The accused is a volunteer at local diese, a ninety-year-old Rwanda refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without starting a criminal prosecution.
The prosecutor now informed that on the basis of new evidence, a man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faced the charge of burning.
In case he's found guilty, he's in danger of ten years in prison and a high penalty.
According to his lawyer, a man regrets the act and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, wrote Le Monde.
Wars: We will present "semafor" on Monday for epidemiological measures
The new system is to fulfil the role of the pandemic plan, which is due to the absence of the government and the Ministry of Health of Critics.
"They will gradually be according to the power of the community's spread," the Minister explained.
He added that, for example, the Moravslesian region or Prague would now reach a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as regional, because the situation in individual regions is significantly different, has been complemented.
The Ministry has cooperated with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (URIS).
To a degree, specific measures will be taken by the Minister, whether it is a duty to wear pipes or to organize special departments in hospitals.
To create an epidemiological plan in the television series Prima Party, the Minister of Interior Jan Hamachek (CHSSD) called for clear information about what measures can be expected if the epidemiological situation gets worse.
Daily increase in confirmed cases in Czech Republic in the last days, even though the number of hospitalized remains low.
This was commented by the fact that there is nothing important about the announcement of an extraordinary state or a reconvention of the crisis headquarters.
In view of the growing number of infected since Saturday, the government re-established the obligation of carrying guns on internal action over 100 people.
Since Monday, the capacity of these actions will be limited to 500 persons, now accounting for 1,000 people.
The government's procedure, when it was not clear in the last minute, which measures and when they would start to pay or when they were announced, was critical.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main factors should create the sense of certainty and the confusion to compare," Senator Marek Hilsher said in the Questions.
The measures may now differ according to the region, for example in Prague since Sunday, the obligation to wear roasts is also in non-resident health facilities, such as in pharmacists or waiting rooms for a doctor.
The obligation to wear crops at the visit of health and social facilities or pharmacists has also been introduced since Friday in the Liberian and Ustecki region.
There is a need to wear guns in the internal public spaces, in the MHD and in health facilities since 14 July.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures were released in the Moravsland Region, as well as in the Mediterranean region in Kutnogor.
The Czech Government has already approved a so-called semafor for Europe at the beginning of June, which colourably distinguishs the risk of disease in individual European countries, and thus regulates rules applicable to entry into Czech Republic from these countries.
In low and medium-risk countries, officials do not require a negative test on coronavir from 15 June for Czech citizens or do not order a quarantine instead.
They are obliged to return the Czechs from countries with high risk.
At this point, all EU Member States are now in a category with low-risk diseases.
Technoparts on Benesovska continue.
Plays third capacity, she's finished at noon
Technoparts at Headačkov Lhota in Benesovska continues on Sunday evening.

Music production is still partially ongoing.
We expect it to be gradually disconnected and discussed musical systems," Novoková said.
"The police continue to monitor the visitors who are leaving in order to prevent drivers under the influence of alcohol or habitats.
The drivers have the opportunity to be subjected to preventive respiratory tests before leaving," she added.

The police have also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the participants, the police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests on the presence of lump and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants hadn't decreased, the police would have hit it.
In the television show Prima Party, the Minister of Interior Jan Hamachek (ČSSD) said that.
However, the number of participants decreased under 1,000, so the police evaluated that the intervention was not necessary, and neither the hygiene station or the Ministry of Health requested it.
The Czech Television (CT) stated on Sunday that the technoparts also extended to surrounding lands whose owners did not agree with the use of technoparts.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will require the refund of damage.
The Technologies on the arch at the Headscape Lhota arrived on Friday night.
The police originally watched the port in Blažimi in Benesovska on Friday, where the Technoparts were held last year.
Blagost is about 30 miles from the Headscape Lhota, where the techniques actually moved.
According to Novok, no one's arrived in Blagi.
Pushing snake: The girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year has been recorded in the Railway.
The serpents stabbed a girl, a year old 2010, whom the parents brought themselves to the rescue service base,” told Dennis by the district healthcare speaker, Maria Svobodová, with the child being transferred to the hospital in Klatov.
The serpent is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic, and these animals are in a higher number in the woods, so it is good to be careful in the walks.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance of a snake to smash you isn't too high, they're afraid of themselves in common contact.
And if he has space to do that, he likes to go away for a loud syringe.
He only attacks if he feels very threatened - for example, if you mistakenly stick on it.
Even her stiffing is not a tragedy, but her poison is very effective against small insects, but it will not kill people.
It can only happen if a person has a particularly weak organism, or suffers from allergy.
Therefore, the risk is particularly in children, seniors and allergy.
"A man has often a feeling of vomiting, sweats, has increased temperature, thirst, stomach pain and spray, in the weak individuals and especially allergy can occur to anaphylactic shock," described Miriam Greda from the Clatov Hospital.
The man threatened to throw the baby out of the window.
After the policeman, he lied wine and thrown the dishes.
After 11:00 a.m., an intervention unit came into the apartment and detained a man.
In the press report, the circuit police spokesman Marketa Janovska said that the baby was immediately taken to the care of the healthcare.
The man didn't want to cooperate with the cops, throwing a dishes, knife or pouring it out of the wine window after the police negotiator.
His threats have been strengthened several times during the negotiation by putting himself in his arms with the child.
Once, he even climbed on the parapet of the window where he wrapped.
The man's police are still investigating.
He doesn't want more information to be public yet.

These eggs will also be eliminated in the assanation company," state veterinary administration said.
In the control of the live fish bar, it was found that the salesman has no evidence of the origin of the goods and is not registered for sale of live fish.

Putin telephoned to Greenski before the opening of the premises in Donbas, Kreml criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken telephonely to his Ukrainian Volodymir Zelenski on the situation in Donbas, where he should start paying a new reconciliation since midnight.
Putin also criticised the decision of the Ukrainian parliament on local elections; Kyev informed that Greensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.

The summer is to begin after midnight on Monday, to be "complete and general" and to open the way to meet other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin said in a talk to Greenland that the decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to organize local elections opposes the peace agreement from Minsk and threatens the prospects of comparing the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Parliament last week decided that the elections to local representatives will not be carried out in the territory controlled by the Russian rebels.
The Minish Agreement assumes that Kyev will be reconsidered by the Ukrainian border of occupied separatists with Russia after providing wide autonomy to these regions and organizing local elections here.
The Green Office, according to the Unian Agency, stated that both citizens agreed on the benefits of the coming reconciliation in Donbas and on the need for further measures to support peace in this region, such as the demining of battle areas or the withdrawal of part of the front units.
Putina also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, on the Occupied Crim Polo island and in Russia itself.
The Minn Agreement has helped to stop fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front.

Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support of separatists, which Moscow denies.
Greensky has made his priorities from the end of the war in Donbas, but it has not yet been a major breakdown in the negotiation.

To Czech Republic arrived bio LPG, promises environmental operation
The LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a very well-known alternative fuel in Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its substantially lower price against gasoline or oil, given significantly lower consumption tax, but it is also benefited from lower CO2 emissions per mile.
Like gasoline and oil also have its ecological variance - "bio LPG".
However, this is a whole news - the European market first appeared, and the Czech press report of the Czech Association of LPG arrived a few days ago.
"In these days we received the first 15 tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed in a mixture with a classic fossil LPG to our pumping station," quotes the association of Jiri Karlik from Primagas.
Bio LPG, however, cannot be taken as bioethanol or bio oil.
According to the association, the chemical site is consistent with the classic oil LPG, which is now tanked by a number of motorists in their cars.
Therefore, both versions can also be mixed freely.
"The only difference compared to the classic LPG is a way of production," says LPG Ivan Indrak, chairman of the Association.
This is also one of the great advantages LPG was compared to other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, as well as distributing infrastructure is quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
This gas is currently obtained as an adverse product in the production of bioethanol from the rest of the food and sugar plant.
In the future, it should also be made targeted, such as cellulose biomass, i.e. wood waste.
Furthermore, the classical oil LPG forms partially as an adverse product in the refining of oil, partially the separation of land gas.
Therefore, depending on the production technology and sources of the car operation on bio LPG is 40-70% ecologically clearer than the oil LPG operation and up to 90% compared to oil.
It is not, however, an emission of CO2 from car exhaust, but the ecology of fuel production, that is, part "well-to-tank" (the Czechs "from the source to the tank").
Between one of the largest bio LPG producers currently belongs to the Eni, Total and Neste petrochemical company.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan of Clean Mobility (NAP CM), Unipetrol is investigating the possibility of production and Unipetrol in its Lithuanian raphinery.
According to the estimates of the Czech Association, about 170 000 vehicles are driven to the LPG; the Ministry of Environment indicates a little higher number in NAP CM, approximately 200 000.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Transport only last year, almost 6000 car restructurings were carried out on the LPG drive.
The LPG tanking is possible in Czech Republic to approximately 950 different operating stations.

Mobile electoral units or correspondent choice.
Politologist and sociologist were looking for options for the pandemic period
In order to vote in the quarantine in October and Senate elections for coronavir, the vice-premier and the Minister of Interior, Jan Hamachek (CSSD), is required to change the law.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He said it on Sunday at Prima's TV Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss a solution with the representatives of the parliamentary parties in the Ministry.
"Let's do anything, it's going to have to mean a change in the election law," Hamaček said.
The Senate called on the government in the middle to find solutions under the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister stated that the provisions of the law should be adjusted, according to which people in the quarantine cannot vote for health.
For example, the prohibition of vote should remain preserved for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop in the OVM series stated that the option of correspondent election has been deferred since 2004.
Even the current draft of the law, which is in the Parliament, then counts on its introduction for abroad vote, but not in Czech Republic.
At the same time, the proscope considers the concerns of ANO or the CHSSD (because, according to a foreign experience, it would rather record other types of parties) from the corresponding choices as overestimated.
Personally, it is against the option of electronic vote, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klima said that now ad hoc needs to come up with mechanisms (volebs), which could be implemented this year and with the least health risk.
It considers to be prepared for 2021 when parliamentary elections are to be made in Czech Republic.
The correspondence choice (before in a foreign or in Czech Republic) considers one of the functional methods.
As another, they see the already mentioned election units or, for example, the possibility of representative voting within the family.
He added that it was possible to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of coronavir - were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavir infections, various types of elections have been deferred in 67 countries of the world.

Today's protest, which has already been done 18 days after it, has had a weaker participation in the Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom than previously.
By 8:00 there were about 300 people, some streets had to be closed for transport.
The demonstrators played a theatre scene before the government building, where they symbolically locked up Prime Minister Borisov and General Prosecutor Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisors of President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the President of the government.
The resignation of both belongs to the basic requirements of the protesters.
They also requested abolition of the reported health reform and the end of corruption in the construction of the Black Sea Coast.
The organizer of the protests Nikolaj Hadjigenov stated today in the public-law that the "top of escalation" is about to be a "national manifestation in Sofia and blockade throughout the country" in the middle.
He repeated the requirement to withdraw Borisov and his government, as well as to expose early elections.
The proper ones should be performed in March 2021.
Borisov told me before he didn't retire.
It justified, inter alia, the need to conduct Bulgaria with covidu-19 pandemia and the economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he exchanged five members of his government team so that he could not calm the demonstration.
At the beginning of this week, the Government of Borisov stopped voting in parliament on confidence in the Parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic doesn't want any more games without the watches
Coach of footballers Boloni Sinisha Mihajlovic has enough games of Italian leagues without audience.
Serbian coach hopes that since the new season fans will return to the stadium.
"What we're doing here right now is not football.
I'm already full of games without the watchers.
It's a sex football, it doesn't bring me any emotions, no joy.
These fights are worse than training.
Playing this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks it," Mihajlovic said before today's fight against Lecca.
After the coronavirus break, the games of Seria A are followed in a fast track, and even though they play until the evening, their actors are exposed to the hot.
"We play every three days in a horrible air.
In such conditions, they don't even know how the teams are.
To end this season.
These measures had to be approached in order to compete, but I hope that the fans will be back since September," said the coach who led Fiorentin or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovic, this season is unusual even because he missed four months on the bench because of the treatment of leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the interruption of the league, and all the other, our team was able to move a higher level.
We want to continue to grow, and we need the players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We became the target of the cyber attack of foreign countries, Iran claims
Since the end of June, a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, but also oil raphineries, power plants, factories and businesses have been reported to fires and explosions.
Some Iranian factors pointed out that the fire that broke in the underground nuclear operation in Natanz could cause cyber sabotage.

However, he has not shared more details about possible offenders according to Reuters.
Musavi also supplemented that fires in forests, raphineries and other places are common in the summer.
The Iranian State Agency IRNA discussed this month that the enemies of Iran, like Israel and the United States, could be behind recent incidents.
None of these countries have been charged directly with specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States interrupted diplomatic contacts shortly after the 1979 revolution, when the Iranian military students attacked the American embassy in Teheran and held 52 American hostages for 444 days.
The long-term tensioned relations between the two countries were sharp in 2018 after Washington departed from the 2015 Nuclear Agreement between Iran and World Powers and introduced sanctions against Iran, which have a strong impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation arrived this year after the US Army killed Iranian General Casema Soleum and Iraqi Militia Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3th.
Then Iran fired the bases in Iraq on January 8, where the Americans operated, the number of missiles.
The United States confessed with departure that dozens of American soldiers were injured.
Israel considers Iran its main enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu is the main opponent of the international nuclear agreement with Iran of 2015.
According to Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb, which Iran denies.

Smart quarantine might be taken by soldiers.
We're ready, they're reporting
"Smart quarantine works, it's what to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss this with the army tonight.

The Ostrav Primator Macura won't run again because he doesn't want to "fuck up in politics"
The current island primator Tomasz Macura (ANO) will not be running in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the attempt to "non-shit in politics," said the server Respect.cz.
Macura, a member of the ANO Movement Chairman, is the primator of the Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO Movement in Ostrava received a almost a third of the votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in function for only four years.
"I thought I could endure one functional period and with this experience of business here in that time, I can turn it all over and put it on my feet," he said to Respect.
He added that at the second election period he had been able to negotiate to a certain extent.
"But it's the maximum for me.
I don't want to be foolish in this policy," added Macura, who, in his conversation, described himself as a difficult introvert, which does not match common contact with people.
According to Respect, it has been speculated for a long time about Macour's possible end in the ANO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticised the ANO movement, for example for association with the SPD movement or for supporting Milos Zeman in presidential elections.
As one of the few individuals, ANO supported the elections of Zeman's anti-candidate of George Drahosh.
From the movement ANO that entered in 2017, Makura does not plan to leave.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in movement, that it's not a completely vain fight, and that no one's going to do it, I don't have the immediate motive to end," he said to Respect.
Sixty-fifteen-year-old Macura studied a high-economic school in Prague.
Before he became an island primator in 2014, Macura was, inter alia, director of the manufacturer of the Walmark pharmaceutical company.
He was also sitting in the bodies of other companies.

Against Uberu in Brna, taxiers protested, pointed out that Uber did not meet the conditions such as the name of taxi or taxameter.
However, the change in the law has changed the conditions for normal taxes and alternatives since July.
The shortwall has graduated several negotiations with the representatives of Uber in recent weeks.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year with its services.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows the company to operate legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services in the limits given to it," Kratofville said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
The taxiers protested against him for not marking vehicles as taxi or missing taxameter.
The Court has issued preliminary measures that prohibit Ubera from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxiers, but the Primator Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to Uber in Brna.
According to the court decisions later, Uber could ride in Brna, but the company did not use it.

Request for a revocation of Rafaje will discuss Babish with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babish (ANO) plans Monday with coalition social democrats to discuss the request for an appeal to the chief of the Anti-Monopoly Authority (UOHS) Peter Rafaj.
Rafaya has called upon non-profit organisations to negotiate the government's anti-corruption Council, as well as the County of the Ustos.
Social Democrats claim that the exchange of office is on the spot.
According to CTU, Rafaj was not invited to the Government's Office on Monday.

It also requests reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Authority.
The decision of the UOHS on public procurement according to the Deputy Heitman for Transport Jaroslava Komenka is not transparent and has signs of will.
Last March, the police interfered with the antimonopoly office because of the tend to choose myth.
This year in June, the server Currently.cz noted that Rafaj uses apartments written to the company of an influenced behind player ČSSD Alexandra Kuba.
Reservation of 3.5 million for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
The Chairman of the Competition Protection Office is Rafaj since 9 July 2009, for the second functioning period the President of the former Member of Social Democracy appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafajov's second six-year-old mandate will expire.
The Antimonopoly Authority Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Office on the proposal of the government.
It can only be revoked if it does not function for more than six months or disrupts the dignity of its function or independence and impartiality of the Authority in a serious manner.

Pietro Philippi breaks discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech bracelet Pietro Philippi wants to focus on sustainableness and is making a major change in the strategy.
He's cutting off discounts, and he doesn't want to crush one collection at a time.
The fact that fashion industry belongs to the largest environmental pollutant is not a news.
In the fuel rooms and on the stores, there are billions of clothing ending each year.
The view of slow fashion, often disregarded access to clothing, but over the past years it has changed relatively quickly.
Approximately half of the goods Pietro Philippi sold at full price.
The other half that sold with discounts, she's not just gonna buy.
The company does not want to crush one collection at the end of each season of products under their production price.
Furthermore, Michal Micah’s owner is gone from new and old collections and blind follow-up to changing fashion trends.
"The majority of traders are counting on discounts already when they buy goods, and the full price is much higher than the margin.
So it's actually a little fraud," says Pietro owner Philippi Michal Micka.
Furthermore, the company wants to support local business.
"Each of our products is made of carefully chosen quality substances and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made of so-called basic pieces - i.e. a clothing that is overtime and overseasonal.
In the world, a segment of the premium marks of absence of any discount is a typical discount, the product price simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," Micka adds.

He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an international camp where he was held for weeks.
He and his brother, however, were able to avoid a concentration camp by the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939 Taussig arrived in Great Britain, where he voluntarily entered the Royal Air Force (RAF), and followed a pilot training in African South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He joined the battle operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the same revolution, he visited Czech Republic and the Teplicas, who gave him honorable citizenship.
Sixty-five-year-old Camil Vacek, whom people in the industry of the street graphic art know under the name Camo, worked with sprays in warm streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffitis on the surfaces that the Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) was separated for these purposes.
Hannah Storm arrived at the coast of Texas
Hurikan Hanna arrived on Saturday afternoon at the local time (midnight SELC tonight) on the southwest coast of the American state of Texas.
The Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 miles north of the city of Port Mansfield, and he weakened on a tropical storm.
However, according to meteorologists, it is a great danger for coastal residents.
Because he brought with him a strong wind and intensity collapse; along with local floods, the AP reports that electricity and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott already announced the state of natural disaster for 32 districts in the southwest of Texas and recommended voluntary evacuation for people.
The most powerful warnings have been received from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and the Bay of Mesquite Bay, but he has been living for nearly 500 miles before moving over northeast Mexico.
"Although Hannah is now a tropical storm, a strong rain and wind can rise in levels, a dangerous inflammation and a single tornade represent a threat," warned the American National Centre for hurricanes (NHC).
This morning, the local time (SELC afternoon) storm was moving in the area of the American and Mexican border and accompanied by the wind speed of 85 miles per hour.
Hannah became the first hurricane in the Atlantic season this year.
Over the Mexican Gulf, the wind of speed to 145 miles per hour, but it gradually weakened up to 112 miles per hour, which Hannah was removed from the categories of hurricanes.
Local authorities called on the storms to wait at home and not forget the hygienic measures related to preventing the spread of coronavir.
Texas belongs to the American states which covid-19 pandemia suffices the most.
Given the existing security measures and the need to comply with the derogations are a major challenge and possible evacuation.
The premises were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Texas district of Hidalgo, one of the buildings was also adjusted as a shelter after evacuated who had a positive test on coronavir or were otherwise exposed to diseases.
Local authorities called on all evacuated to take guns and disinfective geels with them, if possible.
"We're not even behind it yet.
We expect catastrophic floods," quoted the AP Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Provisions say that in some places a few hours raining of up to 300 millimeters of coast, in some cases nearly 500 mm, which together with the sea level could flood a number of seats on the coast.
Zeman will borrow Colonel Lipko's general dignity.
President Miloš Zeman will rent a general duty to Colonel Paul Lipko in the middle.
This comes from an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for borrowing the dignity of the Brigade General is the August's incorporation of Lipka to the Chairman of the Alliance of the Multinational Division of Northeast in Poland.
Lipka is still acting as a Deputy Commander of the Earth Forces of the Czech Army.
The government proposed a promotion to Zeman at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigade General Karl Rijeka with the position of the representative of the commander of the multinational division of the northeast in the Polish Elblag, which commands the units of the alliance of present presence in the territory of Poland and Pobaltia.
In March, he became director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NUKIB).
The government suggested that Lipku borrow the dignity of the Brigade General.
In accordance with the law on troops from the office, the higher value may be lended to the soldier for the time of the selected function or for the period of performance of the service task that requires a higher value.
The representative of the Commander of the Alliance Division is in line with the general dignity.
The soldier to whom the dignity was borrowed has the same rights and obligations as if he was appointed to this quantity.
However, he does not have the right to adjust the payment that would meet the duties.
The rental loan takes place in the absence of the reason for which it was granted.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional preparedness and is a model for subjects.
It is significantly participating in the fulfilment of the tasks of the Czech Republic's armed forces, including cooperation with foreign partners and the security of military participation in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June to a proposal for promotion.
The secondary improvement will be made at 12:30 at the Prague Castle, the Minister of Defence Lubomir Metnar or head of the General Staff, Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavir standards for aviation
The European Union has agreed on common hygienical standards for aircraft travel to reduce the spread of the new coronavir.
The German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer announced it.
However, among the agreed standards is the maintenance of the departure or carrying of roofs in the aircraft and at the airport, the middle seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unconditioned.
Reuters informed the agency.
"I am pleased that my colleagues adopted a German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement was concluded by officials and that the ministers still have to approve it formally.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover their mouths and noses for passengers since six years, to respect the recommended derogation in security controls and disposal at the airport.
The aircraft must also guarantee sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to capture the middle seats.
The common provisions under which the officials agreed shall meet at least some of the requirements of airlines.
Because different standards caused confusion.
The arctic Spitbergs fell the temperature record, measured almost 22 degrees there.
"In Longyearbyen, 41-year-old record fell," said the Norwegian Meteorological Institute on Twitter.
At night, the temperature rose to the 21.7 degrees of Celsia, with 0.4 degrees over the record of 1979, he added.
Approximately 20,000 Longyearbyen is the largest city in Spicberki, located about 1300 miles from the northern pole.
The spickberries are warming faster than nearly any other place on Earth.
This fact emphasizes the risk of heating other ends of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, the report of the Norwegian Centre for Climate Study last year is stated.
The average temperature in the Spickberks, according to him, increased by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it may even increase by 10 degrees unless greenhouse gas releases are reduced into the atmosphere.
Temperature growth may result from the drowning of eternally frozen soils on Spicberks, which would threaten the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and may also cause greater amounts of graves and land sewages.
Climate warming also threatens an arctic fauna such as ice bears or tules that are dependent on the ice covering of the ocean.
British who return from Spain are waiting for a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British office also called on citizens to avoid all roads to the landland of Spain because of the risk of spreading covid-19.
Thus, the Canary and Balear Islands are not mentioned, but even after their return, people have to be insulated for two weeks.
The new rules shall enter into force at midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British diplomacy said in its statement.
"We have always made it clear that if this is necessary, we shall immediately remove a country from the list of those safe," she added.
As the British Metro newspaper noted, the latest notifications will affect thousands of British travel plans.
Because Spain belongs to a very popular vacation destination.
The British are, inter alia, concerned whether the hospital will be paid if they have to end 14 days in isolation after return from holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne ordered a ten - day vacation to Lanzarote, leaving on Tuesday.
The race has been ordered since December.
"We were supposed to go all the family, my wife Amanda and Bethany's daughter, but to be honest, after this notice, I don't know what's going to happen.
I'm working as a machine leader and I don't think my employer will join that I'll be back from the vacation two weeks in the quarantine," quoted the Metro Huntera journal.
With regard to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
In the last two days, there has always been more than 900 newly infected in 24 hours.
In some areas, officials have already strengthened coronavir measures, such as Catalan, trying to limit all nightlife and prevent people from gathering together in a large number.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has newly noted the increased risk of infection in Catalan, Aragonia, Baskick and Madrid.
The government will discuss the purchase of electricity from Dukovan
The government will discuss on Monday a model of buying electricity from the planned new Nuclear Electricity Block of Dukovana.
The proposal of the law is based on the fact that, if the price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through the tariffs.
In the second case, when the price is lower than the price on the market, the impact on the consumer will be opposed.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final electricity price for the beneficiaries.
Vice-premier and Minister of Industries Karel Havlicek (for ANO) and the energy company CEZ have earlier stated that the more likely option is that people will save their energy by building.
On the contrary, analysts note that the long-term view of electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
The intention has already been criticised by environmental organizations.
"The buying price can be both under the market price of power power and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rules can be both negative and positive.
The impact is allocated to customers according to the security size - at lower consumption or by electricity consumption - in higher consumption of electricity," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPOs) stated in the basis of materials.
In May, he said that he assumes that the high-trade price of electricity will grow and people will earn on the construction of Dukovan.
Otherwise, the impact of tens of crowns per year will be within the family, which is far less than he believes that people are paying annual invoices for electricity to support so-called supported resources.
He had earlier estimated that the price of the ransom could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 Kč) for megawatthodin (MWh).
The presented material does not contain any draft amount, shall be contained in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Bureau for 2021, which is now the most supplies, is currently approximately 45 euros (about 1190 Kč) for MWh.
"After the difference in the price of the purchase and market price of power electricity at 10 euros, the average household supplement with 3.3 MWh annually - may correspond to four-member households, standardly equipped with electrical consumption, including electric alarms and pipes, which, however, does not use electricity for heating and heating of warm water - less than 100 Kč/year," said the basis for the MPO government.
"We live in a great turbulent time.
The pandemia of coronavir has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices as an explicit speculative matter," said the CTC executive director of the Energy Investment Group, Tomasz Voltr.
The proposed law considers that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO, the respect of its authorised legal person owned by a State at a pre-determined price.
The contract between the investor and the State, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension for ten years, as long as possible, until low-carbon production is completed.
The low-carbon production proposal defines as a production of electricity with a nuclear reactor connected to the electrical system with the installed capacity of minimal electricity of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Rather, the new Dukovan bloc has to have 1200 MW performance and produce nine teravathodin electricity annually, which would correspond to the tenth expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put in operation in 2036.
The new Dukovan bloc finance model approved by the government on Monday.
The construction equipment should be financed in no time, with two per cent of the interest in operation.
The financing model does not agree with opposition, also disturbing her the possibility of the Dukovanis to build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction of 70 per cent.
The rest should be paid by the CEZ, which will also pay all possible additional costs.
The Director-General of Chez Daniel Beneš said in May that the expected amount for building a block at current price is approximately six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
The treaties between the State and the CEO on the construction of a new Dukovan bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development downloaded two billion tourism material in the media
The material planned by the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) to spend in the media, online and billboards for advertising for holidays in Czech Republic, has withdrawn two billion crowns from the commentary procedure.
Minister Clara Dostalová (for ANO) server of the List of Messages.cz said that the material is still working on.
The document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) reported on Friday the Transport Server.cz.
The Ministry's plan justified a ruin of travel for coronavir.
During the coronary crisis, income and media declined.
The proposal has raised the criticism of opposition and travel representatives.
According to a proposal that is now to look at the web of the patrolacstat.cz, the MMR planned to give through a state travel agency CzechTourism money on TV advertising, radio, press, online, billboards or stations.
The biggest piece of money, 700 million crowns, would get TVs.
Most of them would have received private TVs from Nova and Prima.
The printed journals and weeks would receive 400 million and the same part would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banneries and videos on the website.
The radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which again private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used in the outer advertisement on billboards, LED screens and surfaces on railways or in the subway.
The campaign to support travel in Czech Republic was to start in the middle of August and take a year.
"The material is still working on, it is definitely not in the form that should be presented yet," Dostal said without further details of the List Report server.
The material criticised the opposition, according to the head of the TOP 09 Markets of Pekar's Adam's advertising, would profit from the media from Prime Minister Andreja Babiša (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this disrespect will be taken on the autumn at the elections of a wound between the eyes," she wrote on Twitter.
A sufficient denies that it is in fact to help the media affected by the crisis.
"It may be a coincidence, I don't know anything about the support of the media," she said on Friday, "Denyc N.
It says that the budget is two billion orientation.
"Of course we're still counting, it may be less.
It's a work material," she added.
Initiative Save Tourism does not give a media campaign to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for travel firms, not an inadequate advertising campaign," Tom Barczyk said on Sunday.
If those two billion crowns are located in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not to the media, the initiative is written in the open letter to the government.
Living, beer beer and death as a grass
After death is also the third album named A death is the grass of a poet of bronze, the tired organiser of cultural activities and the publisher Jaroslav Eric Frice, who left also a year ago, on May 24th.
In Frich's disclosure, it is the fifth item and just like the previous titles, and there is the main emphasis on Fritch's poetry, which is the excellent interpreter.
Frič, 1949, was apparently affected by an American beat generation, however, this inspiration passed through his own, particularly administered experiences and very inner expressions of faith.
However, he was awakening some agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, inagresive, completely tolerant.
I think of Godslav Reynek in this regard (e.g. contrast to John Gardener,) the masters will excuse.
Fritch's album offers copy reading from 2006, but also a show with musicians who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was a violoncelist Joseph Key, or Honza Barton and Victorious Holata.
I would like to help - with the words of the island poet Peter Hrushka on Frich's long poetry.
"Sall of them proud and unending bitterness," says Hrushka, "to the state of our world threatened by the disappearance.
The world, which is increasingly falling into the melted consumption of vulnerability and grossness, is increasingly departing from what his soul was created - from the secret of faith, humility and human neighbourhood.
The oppression of the one who knows that the values for which he was created were little of interest, but who also knows that only because of the universal interest of them cannot be renounced.
These poems reminded that a person might have to lose everything expensive, but it is not important how he loses it.
If he sells to universal decline, he sceptically resigns, scary shuts up, or remains till the last moment in a quiet and proud insistence on what he believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamaček.
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of the Czech Republic, Jiří Paroubek, is not a paid social democracy advisor.
The President of the Party and the Minister of Interior, Jan Hamakek, only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
The hammer said that today on the television show of Prima Party.
On Friday, Paroubek should be the Hamaček Adviser, informed the list of messages.cz.
"We write a text from time to time, he sends me some material, and I read it," said Hamaček today.
He added that it is not, however, official and payable cooperation.
He believes that the CHSD does not have any means to waste them for similar purposes.
"That I sometimes read his opinion, such people are a lot," he said.
In the subsequent discussion with OSS Member Jana Montenegro, the Minister said that many members of ODS still "are inoccupiedly listening to the opinions of Václava Klause".
He believes it is okay because it is an experienced politician and former President of the Party, which is also the case of Parubka.
The fact that the media are making an affair, he marked this year's corn season.
The server List Reports.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek fulfils the role of Hamachek's non-official consultant.
He also wrote that at the fourth place of the party's candidate in the retirement region, a former president of Peter Benda's cell, who is connected with the Paroubk and acted as Vice-President of his LEV 21.
The hammer said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it's ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile increment, it's a shock in the ass, grieving the Swedish envoy.
Just a 22-year-old American ticker has ambitions and potential to belong to the most important competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis for two years of younger, last year, he beat him at the NCAA Association.
"We had a battle a year ago, then he won, and I was the second, then we went through it.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," says Nilsen, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
But since then Duplantis has fired the roofs up and is currently lonely in the highest tick spheres.
In only twenty years, he became a world recordman, this year on 8 February in Toruni, he overcome a 6,17 metres high, and a week later, in Glasgow he added a centimetr.
"He jumped six meters when he was 18 years old when he graduated from high school," his classmate Nilsen recalls for the Web World Athletics.
"It was clear that as soon as he grows up from a boy to a man, all his potential and talent is ten times.
Twenty years is quite a good age to jump the world record," he believes.
While Nilsen's number of successes is thicker than the one proud of Duplantis, the American is putting similar goals.
He has yet identified his options at the NCAA races that he regularly wins, this year in February, he improved his internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August, he got a gold medal on the Panama games in Lima, in 2017, he struggled into an American trip to the world championship, where he ended 13.
Then the nearest milestone is to taste the Diamond League for him for the first time.
"Certainly my priority is to get to the professional circle and race as much as possible in the Diamond Liga, because there you can make a name," he realizes.
"When you can succeed at this level, you can certainly do the same thing as the Olympic Games, the world's championship, or the panimeric games."
But because of the pandemic, these high holidays are delayed, which gives Nilsen and other stickers time to improve.
But will it be enough to reach Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into just a struggle for silver?
"Everyone is trying to reach him, but I don't think that it will be possible at the nearest time," Nilsen considers.
"The boy has been jumping 16 years, and he's got a mile jump over all the other."
And before Tokyo starts 2021, he'll want to increase it.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands of disability pensions of the impossible son.
She's waiting for a court.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from a state as a disabilities pension is primarily intended for improving the quality of his life.
A woman's defeat is threatened for eight years of jail.
Because of a bad health condition, the court dismissed the sick man’s rightness and appointed his mother a guardian who was to manage his son’s money.
"Women from half November 2013 to January this year used a part of the financial retirement of the son's disabled retirement for his own needs and made it up by 440,000 crowns," said the police spokesman Dana Ladman, saying that the accused woman had a specially established obligation to protect the interests of the injured.
Although a woman, in accordance with the instructions of the court, made an account for her son, but she had his retirement sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with the stay of a son in the health facilities and the repayment of the necessary medicinal products, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of vehicles, electro-consumers and for households," the plaintiff states.
That she can't use her son's money for her own needs, the woman admitted.
However, she fought by helping her to pay family expenses with them.
"We have had problems with our income to pull homestep.
We've never bought anything more than standard.
It was always about things that the son's buy would approve.
I thought it was family money.
I didn't know I was doing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised she'd return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, according to scientists after finding tools
The findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican State Zacatecas include 1930 instruments of calcium, including soft blades that could be used to cut meat, and top objects that could serve as spears or spears.
Scientists found that the oldest of the tools came from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," the archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the main author of one of the two studies published in the magazine Nature.
The youngest instruments reach 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite caves, located in a large supersea height, were living for 20,000 years.
Until now, the universally recognized theory has spoken that the first representatives of the type Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from today's Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spears used to kill mammutes and other prehistoric animals, showed that this fabric culture had then spread in the largest part of North America.
This model, however, has been erected in the last decades, when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
In the second study published in the magazine Nature, 42 different locations throughout North America, which prove human presence on the continent from 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small quantity of people could have arrived in the North American land before it was expected.
Some of them could get ships to America.
"It is obvious that people have been in America long before the development of so-called Klavian culture," stated anthropology from the university of Ruth Gruhn in Alberta's Canadian Province.
The interest in tickets is currently filled with a optimistic scenario, claims sellers.
The prices are also gradually reduced.
Sales tickets in Czech Republic grow every week.
In contrast to the last summer, the interest is still about halfway, but demand grows every week to 20 percent.
The development after the crisis, according to sellers, fills the most optimistic scenarios.
Increasingly, airline prices are also reduced.
Among the most searched destinations are sellers, in particular the Southern European states.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are led.
The lotuška portal.ch is the most selling flights to Croatian Split.
From other countries, then, is the most searchable British, which, of course, belonged to the most difficult destinations ever.
The average price of tickets is also reduced.
At the portal of Letuska.cz, approximately half a month, it moved about 6250 crowns, between 3,000 crowns less.
This is mainly caused by an increase in the demand for European destination, which now constitutes about 85 percent of sales.
However, the prices themselves to some European places, such as Spain or Italy, have fallen about five in the past weeks.
The crisis also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets with much less advance than before, because they are afraid of further development of the coronavir situation.
According to previous information, Kiwi.com, the time of buying a ticket before the flight decreased about ten days between the year.
"It confirms us the future trend when people will order tickets with much less advance, will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice-President for Kiwi.com Michal Shindelar.
Currently, the average booking time is before leaving 21 days.
In addition to the growth in sales, the number of renewed airlines from Czech Republic also increases.
In the Prague airport, regular lines are currently running within more than 60 destinations.
Last summer season, it's about half the destinations.
It's a big final tonight!
Watch the arrow battle live on New Sport
The second most prestigious tournament in the PDC organization has reached the great final.
It will be presented by a experienced 19-year-old Scotch Arrow Gary Anderson and a tournament surprise, a 16-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson expelled Justin Pip in the first round, then hit his neighbor in the table ladder.
But even James Wade managed, and in the quarterfinal, he struggled with Simon Whitlock, who sent home a world unit.
The Flying Scot was nearly in the semi-final when he faced Michael Smith.
But at the last moment he escaped the shovel graveman, he dominated in prolongation and after the result of 18:16 he fought his place in the final tournament that he had ruled in 2018 when he defeated Mensura Suljovice 21:19 in a marvelous battle.
The biggest surprise of the World Matchplay is Dimitri van day Bergh.
The Belgian talent enjoys the tournament, and it may be aware that he has nothing to lose, helped him play a fantastic wave.
The sixteen - year - old arrowman first surprised the world sixth of Nathan Aspinall, a dramatic battle was overtaked by Joa Cullen, and in the quarterfinal after a sharp appearance, Adrian Lewis also defeated.
A big check was a semifinal.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength, but in peace playing Belgian then gained an excellent series of prospects, which then had kept more without problems until the end.
Van day Bergh showed his strength in high score, which he faced occasional uncertainty on doubles.
The cases of coronavir have arrived at least from the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased.
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been infected.
Almost 9,600 of them have already been healed, 368 patients died.
At present, 5,254 people are sick.
It comes from the data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four hundred times.
Maximum was the Friday 281 cases.
On Thursday, the positive 235 tests were tested, a day earlier 246 and Tuesday 206.
In the first working day of the week, 169 infected arrived.
From covidu-19, 9 590 people have already been healed in Czech Republic, that is 63 percent of all infected.
Most of the disease had a mild progress.
In the hospital, according to the latest data of the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavir, 19 of them consider doctors serious.
There are several fires of covid-19 in Czech Republic.
The most infected in the past seven days in the recalculation of 100,000 inhabitants continue to show Karvinia, almost 59.
Follows Jihlav's district with 56 and Frydecko-Mjesto with 36 infected to 100 000 inhabitants in the last week.
The increase in the number of infected people in Czech Republic has resulted in new measures against the spread of coronavir since Saturday.
People must wear crops on internal mass stocks over 100 people, these are cultural and sports activities, as well as weddings and funerals inside buildings.
Since Monday, the capacity of these actions from the current thousands of people will be limited.
In the world, the number of people who have provenly infected the new coronavir has exceeded 16 million.
This was stated by the American University of Johns Hopkins, which has been monitoring the development of pandemic globally.
The balance of the victims who died with covid-19 diseases is nearing 645 thousand, according to this source.
The latest million infected arrived in statistics in only three days; the border of 15 million fell on 22 July.
The largest share in rapid growth in cases in the United States, which have already registered over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where, according to the authorities, nearly 1.4 million people were infected.
The infected are now getting at the record rate.
The World Health Organization announced this week that from Thursday to Friday more than 284 thousand new cases have arrived worldwide, which is the highest daily balance since the beginning of pandemia.
This development can be added to the fact that the proliferation of the disease is at the top of the people, such as the United States, Brazil or India, according to the Reuters Agency, but the number of new cases in the past week has increased in nearly 40 countries around the world.
This concerns Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel, for example.
Infection has already occurred in nearly all countries of the world, the first case has officially announced the KLDR today.
House air is up to five times worse than outside.
Health damages air refrectors and diodorants
Health threatens not only the bad quality of air in outer spaces but also home.
Carol Abraham, an Israeli expert on human health, quoted the Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who had earned the creation of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on damage in households right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the American Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than the country.
The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that because of the bad quality of air in its homes, 3.8 million people die early in the year.
"Because of the epidemic of coronavir, which has forced many and still forced them to work from home, people must spend more hours in their homes than before, so it is time to focus on the quality of air in households," Abraham said.
In Israel, it says that almost no one cares about the quality of home air.
However, dangerous things can be things with which a person normally comes into contact - accommodation, air refrectors, disinfective means, diodorants or pesticides.
"The poisonous gas also produces the clothes we regularly wear in the cleaning room," Abraham said.
Children, old family members, and respiratory people are most threatened.
Otherwise, individuals can start to suffer problems such as headache, worms, nose irritation, nose bleeding, vomiting or skin allergies.
In the long-term exhibition of unhealthy substances, internal authorities and central nervous system may be damaged.
Not all damages, but come from the objects inside the house, the source may also be the material from which the houses are built.
