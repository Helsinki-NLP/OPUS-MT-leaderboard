According to the Taeba Directive, it is recommended that members only add sentences in their own language or to translate from the language he understands, to their own own language. The reason is that it is much easier to compose naturally sounding sentences in their own language. When we write in language other than their own, it is very easy to create sentences that sound strange. We ask you to translate the sentence only when you know what it means.
