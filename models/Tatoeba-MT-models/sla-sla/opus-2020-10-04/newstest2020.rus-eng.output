TikTok hides unpleasant videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of which are under 18 years
Imagination China / Reuters
The Chinese Social Network of TikTok is subjected to censorship of videos that refer to the Tinjanmen area, Tibet's independence or the forbidden religious group of Falunggun, reports The Guardian.
The publication reports that the owner of TikTok (by the ByteDance company) has promoted the goals of China's foreign foreign foreign policy through the annex.
The majority of the infringements relating to China's policies falls under “inflammation of hatred”.
In any case, TikTok places disadvantaged publications in the context of general rules so that the social network does not seem to be a censor.
For example, the prohibition of the criticism of the Chinese social system is under the general prohibition of " criticism or attacks on politics and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc. " .
The prohibition of mention of incidents in the Tanyanmen Square or genocide in Cambodia is under the "relapse of the history of China or other countries".
The document also presents a list of the prohibited names of the twenty “foreign leaders or government leaders”, including the North Korean leaders of Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sena and Kim Xen Yena, the Indian Politician Mahatmu Gandhi, the American Presidents of Donald Tramp and Barak Obama, the Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe, South Korean President Pac Kyn Hi, the President of Indonesia, Joco Vido and the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, indicated in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as indicated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by the administrators of the social networks and can block the user.
Not too strict violations relate to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to the algorithms of TikTok.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules were old and are no longer applied, "We are now using a localized approach and attract independent local specialists."
The Russian users of TikTok did not have specific restrictions on publications, said the Coordinator of the Producer Centre by Ruste Bogdans.
The Producer Centre is one of the Russian media companies that are officially cooperating with TikTok.
All advertising materials of the Producer Centre agree with representatives of social networks, but users can be placed without consent, Bogdanov transmitted.
On the question of whether Politics or Putin can be spoken in TikTok, Goddanov responds firmly and says that he has seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of Our Didgital Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for the users of TikTok are listed in a user agreement: the shocking content, discriminating statements and so on. "
However, any content that moderators do not like is noted to these rules.
Zaripov's agency is another Russian partner TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of which are less than 18 years old.
According to the user agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons aged 13 years.
Social administrators check their age through artificial intelligence: neuroscience analyses the faces and determines how old a person looks, says Bogdanov.
If the neurosphere decides to be a younger user, its account can be removed, he adds.
According to RBK, ByteDance opened a office in Moscow in the WeWork covorking territory in September 2019.

The construction will be completed at the end of 2022, and the next time the first disciples will be picked up.
"The project provides for the establishment of a public, non-commercial educational space, which is based on the traditions of the classic Moscow school and experimental methods," said Moscow Invest's press service.
Chile began to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros
TACS reported this with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, this week, the building of a building building was officially launched, where the European Extremely Large Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) was located until the most expensive and ambitious earthly astronomical project.
Its total value, according to ESO, would exceed a billion euros.
Most of these money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complicated component of the telescope is its recorded large mirror, whose diameter is about 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 six-angle segments of 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two subsidiary reflective surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT get the first detailed pictures of planets outside the Solar System, the stars in other galaxies, as well as to find the Earth's binaries.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to monitor the areas of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the centre of the Milk Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome was only launched, mirrors, scientific instruments and other observatory components of the scientists, engineers and other experts have been designed for three years since the first E-ELT plans were announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total cost was approximately 400 million euros, received the German SCHOTT and the French Safran Reosc.
