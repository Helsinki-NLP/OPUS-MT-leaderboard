Welsh Congress Representatives are concerned that they will "seem like Muppetti"
Some of the representatives of the Parliament of the Welsh Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, IWP) have been amazed at the proposal that they may be called the representatives of the Welsh Parliament in the future.
This was due to plans to rename the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The representatives of the Assembly from all political spectrums are concerned that they could become a subject of disgustingness.
A corporate representative from the Laburist Party said his group is concerned about the name "removing with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh Twp means stupid, and pwp bullshit.
The corporate representative of the Wales Party (Plaid Cymru) said that the group generally "is not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
The welsh conservative said his group was "opened" for a change in the name, but that MWP in the speech could quickly be turned into Muppet.
In that context, the waltz word “w” speaks similarly to the word “in” in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing the law on the introduction of the name change, said: "Of course, the final decision on how the parliamentary representatives will be titled on them themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that have encountered wide support for changing the names of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the name of the representatives in the Assembly, the Committee was inclined to call "the members of the Welsh Parliament" or the MWP, but the MWP option received the greatest support during public consultation.
The Assembly's representatives suggest alternative options, but the fight to achieve consensus could bring headache to the President of the board, Elyn Jones, which is expected to submit a proposal for a change law within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the functioning of the board, including the rules on the disqualification of the board representatives and the establishment of the committee system.
During the debate on the law, the Assembly's representatives will have a decisive vote on the question of how they want to be called.
Macedonians go to a referendum on the change of country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic North Macedonia".
The goal of voting is to solve a multi-annual dispute with neighbouring Greece with a province called Macedonia
Athena has long endured the claim that the name of her north neighbour is the possession of a Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of the procedure for its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite to change the name, said he would not acknowledge the referendum decision.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change calls a simple price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells shut down while the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The older people I have spoken to have said that bar and church could be found at every corner in the past," Mr. Adams said.
"There is none of them today."
He said the extinction of bars was understandable.
"Ljudi today are communicating in a different way," he said.
"Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood where people stay regularly."
However, when it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the church leaders think and “before or later will be found again at the beginning. ”
He added that churches could replace housing buildings with apartments in which people who will not help the rest of the churches in the neighborhood.
"The great majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "they will come sooner the day the church will be closed completely because it is unlikely that the residents who moved into these apartments will become members of those churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became black metropolitan – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white methodistic congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation that maintained worship nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's church took over the black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was headed by a boycot of traders on a bit in 125th Street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, who opposed employment or improving black people.
The 1939 fire has severely damaged the building, but since the district of Reverend Johnson planned its rebuilding, ordered a series of bells, called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and heir in St. Martin, proudly called carillon “the rings of poor people. ”
The expert who played the carillon in July used the second title: “Cultural Treasure” and“independent historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world in which a black musician Dionisio A. Lind played a larger carillon in the Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happens in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story of architects and construction workers, some of which have brought the Laic Church leaders and other episcopal dicesis.
Sakrastia, the governing body of the council composed of a laik, wrote to the diceza in July because of the concern that the diceza would "urge to transfer expenses" to sakristia, although the sakristia was not involved in the engagement of architects and construction workers sent by the diceza.
Some parishes complained about the lack of transparency on the side of the diceza.
The sea dog hurt a 13-year-old man during the diving of lobsters in California
According to the official statement, the sea dog attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while flying after a lobster in California on the day of the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack happened something about 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said to the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he dived with his friends about an hour and a half of a Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then led him with the group to the scene of attack to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was an excitement because of a catched lobster, but then he realized he was screaming: “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said when he approached the boy, he noticed that his whole key bone was broken.
"I beat everyone out of the water, 'There's a sea dog in the water," Hammel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Council's child hospital in San Diego, and he's still in critical state.
The type of sea dog responsible for the attack is not known.
The captain of the Savior Team Larry Giles said at the press conference that the sea dog was observed in this area a few weeks earlier, but it was established that it was not a dangerous type of sea dog.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas in order to conduct a survey and security of the buyers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of marine dogs in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans for entering the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's becomes competition to chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic pults in the style of store houses and by hiring specialized sellers.
As part of a large entrance to the UK's beauty market worth 2.8 billion. GBP, which continues to grow compared to the fall of sales on the market of clothing and home equipment, large cosmetics will be tested into 11 trades across the country and extend to additional trades next year if they show successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is one of the ways in which supermarkets try to use space on shelves that were once predicted for TVs, microwave ovens and home equipment.
Sainsbury’s representatives said that they would double the offer of cosmetic products to 3000 products, including the first time trademarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing assortiman of L’Oreal, Mordalline and Burt's Bees will get more space with areas for certain trademarks like Boots.
Supermarket also restarts its asortiman decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and that is what younger customers are looking for more.
Furthermore, Fragrance Shop perfume trader will test the concessions in two Sainsbury's store, the first opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second opening in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Network shopping and returning to daily shopping of small foods in local food shops means that supermarkets need to work harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Chief Director Sainsbury's said the outlets will look more like store houses while the chain of supermarkets strives to resist favourable trades such as Aldi and Lidl by offering a larger number of services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s introduced outlets Argos in hundreds of shops, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because he bought both chains two years ago, by which he claimed to encourage the sale of food supplies and made these acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt of supermarket to refresh its departments of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products was not successful.
Sainsbury’s entered a joint business with Boots in early 2000, but it ended up arguing about the division of revenue from the medicinal product in his supermarkets.
The new strategy followed after Sainsbury’s three years ago for 125 million. GBP sold his pharmaceutical work in the 281 Celesiu, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
He claims that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by typing the luxury of skin care products in four shops, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks Commercial Director Sainsbury said: “We have changed our appearance and impression of our divisions with cosmetic products to provide our users a more comfortable environment.
We also invested in a special training of colleagues who will be handed by customers and give them advice.
Our trademark assortiman is designed so that it corresponds to all the needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old purchase habits."
Peter Jones "anger" after Holly Willoughby quit the contract worth 11 million pounds
The star of the Dragon’s Day Peter Jones left that "cooking of anger" after the TV leader Holly Willoughby quit a contract worth 11 million pounds with his trademark to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV trade chain
Willoughby doesn't have time for their business marks of house clothes and fashion supplements to Truly.
Their trade mark is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow trade mark.
The director of this Morning (37) on Instagram announced that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragon’s Day Peter Jones cooking from anger by retiring from a joint profitable work in the last minute to focus on her own new brilliant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources argue that Jones was "anger" when a golden TV girl during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts worth up to 1,5 million pounds mean that there is no longer time to devote to their household and fashion supplements Truly.
This job was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow trademark and was to double Willoughby's wealth estimated to 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on the Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly's greatest priorities.
This was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would provide it for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw scares everyone involved in that business.
No one could believe what's going on Tuesday so close to running the whole line.
In Marlow's seat, there's a lot of goods ready to sell."
Experts believe that, due to the departure of this Morning, one of the stars in Britain, in which it is most invested, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large funds invested in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing and the possible additional deferration of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were ten years close friends with Jones and his husband Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as President of the Administration in March.
The couples spend their holidays together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become an ambassador of the M&S trade mark and replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of the ITV show I'm a celebrity.
The source close to Jones last night said "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
Hard negotiations, and then we fell in love.
He was joking about the account of the criticisms he would receive in the newspapers for the comments that some might consider "deprived of the president" and for having such a positive attitude to the leader of North Korea.
"Why did President Trump give so many resignations?"
Said Trump, imitating the voice of the news leader.
"I didn't give any derogations."
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations are involved.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore on Saturday, the chief diplomat of North Korea Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the north had not noticed the "suitable response" of the United States to disarmament activities in North Korea.
He noted that instead, the United States still did not terminate the sanctions whose target is further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic attitude in his speech at the meeting.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"He threatened us with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – abortion of missile test launches, helping to release hostages and returning the remaining US soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to behave as president, but instead of filling this arena waiting for 10,000 people to enter, we'd have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a bunch of people directly ahead of us.
Cunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the quakes in Lomboc by foreign non-governmental organizations, it was said they weren't necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lomboc population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it's all a little troubled," Ms. Sumbung said.
Although the Children organisation comprises a team to travel to Palo, it is still not safe that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman of the National Disaster Office, said that the Indonesian officials assess the situation in Paluo to see if international agencies would be allowed to engage in the efforts to provide assistance.
Given the continuous tremor of the soil in Indonesia, this country is still sadly unprepared to carry with nature’s anger.
Although the shelters in the case of cunamis were built in Aceh, it is not what is common in other parts of the coast line.
The lack of a siren to warn the tsunami in Paluo, although the warning was in force, likely contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best time, traveling between many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
The hospital ship that was in Lomboc to take care of the earthquake victims on the road to Palo, but it takes at least three days to reach the place of a new disaster.
Improving the Indonesian dissolved structure was the foundation of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
However, the state administration under Joko fights the lack of financial resources, and next year new elections are held.
Joko also faces the pressure of the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fight on the streets of the mačetes, ports and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Look: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge shocked a hit for equation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved on Saturday Liverpool from defeats in the Premier League game against Chelsea in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received adding from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters from Chelsea naked at the result of 1:0 for Chelsea.
He transferred the ball to his left leg before he threw it to the opposite stativa.
The ball flyed high above naked to the right upper corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepaya Arrizabalagai who jumped towards her and entered the network.
"It was difficult to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close as possible to the naked, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I saw Kante coming, and I just touched the ball once, and I didn't think too much about it, and I was just shooting."
She led Chelsea half-time from 1:0 after the start of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
The blue attacker handed the ball back to Mateo Kovačić during this game before he turned around somewhere in the half of the field and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovačić performed a quick add in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful passing ball that Hazarda led to naked.
The gambler circled the defense and left leg hit the ball in the net on the opposite stativa next to the Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool plays a game of club competition against Napoli in the Team Championship League on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Neapoli, Italy.

The number of death victims in the Indonesian cunami increased to 832
The number of death victims in the earthquake and the cunamie in Indonesia increased to 832, stated the State Office for Disasters on Sunday early morning.
The spokesman of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at the press conference that a large number of people were trapped in the ruins of buildings after the magnitude of 7.5 which felt on Friday and caused waves of height up to 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with the remains of destroyed buildings.
The police arrested a man (32) for suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed deadly.
The murder investigation was launched after this morning a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside.
44-year-old girl was found at 07:55 with stabbed wounds on Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old kid was arrested for suspicion of murder.
The police called people from that area to contact if they saw or heard anything.
Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like to see all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead, and they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found by the inhabitant of Birkenhead and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon, there were friends on the scene who believe that they knew that woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police stated that there is an initiation of the nearest victim's family.
The taxi driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him no one was allowed to enter the building or get out of it.
He lost his word when he found out what happened.
The inhabitants are now told that they'll take a few hours until they can get back to their apartments.
The cop allegedly told someone that the whole area was now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene of the crime in the tears.

Of all who have any information, they were asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers to number 0800 555 111, calling on the record of 247 of September 30th.
The Statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument that was launched in the middle of the debate on "closing history"
His persecution would be a poetic justice for the nearly taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts committed by his fanatic puritanian followers.
But Cromwell's company called Mr. Cromwell's attempt with "bullshit" and " trying to overcome history."
John Goldsmit, President of Cromwell’s society, said: “In the debate currently conducted on the elimination of the statues, it was unavoidable that the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace would become the subject of the debate.
Iconoclasm of English civil wars is not something Cromwell ordered or spent.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
The wonderful resurrection of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the way of thinking in the 19th century and part of the history of the person that many still believe is worth honoring.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Mnogy consider Cromwell, perhaps more than today, a parliament defender of external pressure. Of course, in his case, it was the pressure of monarchy.
Is that an entirely reliable opinion a matter of historical debate that continues.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed a subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a individual recognizing figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of the Lord of Protection continue to be worthy of honor and celebrations."
Killer's pig killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, pigs attacked and killed a farmer in the southwest of China.
A man named only Yuan was found dead cut arteries and covered by blood nearby stands on the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province published the Sunday morning list of South China.
The pig farmer was about to vaccine pigs in May 30, 2005 in Xining in the Chinese Qinghai province.
Apparently, on Wednesday, he arrived with his cousin from the neighbourhood of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning a cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighbouring pig was open.
He said there was a big pig male in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, forensic examination confirmed that a pig of 250 pounds of powder had been bite by the farmer to death.
The news of Guiyang's evening suggests that a cousin named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and crushed."
The security camera video showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked in order to prevent someone else from attacking while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market administration are allegedly negotiating the compensation for his death.
Although this is rarely happening, the attacks of pigs on humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, the pig attacked his wife and her wife at their farm in Massachusetts and his husband suffered injuries dangerous to life.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 pounds tapped the Whale farmer along the tractor until his wife expelled the animal.
After the pigs ate the farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs weren't usually aggressive, but that the blood taste could act as a "trigger".
"They are only played.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
It's just to show them respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa brings strong rains to the southwest of the United States
As announced, the hurricane Rosa weakens crossing colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next day, however, Rosa will bring flood rains in the northern Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rosa drove at 5:00 at eastern time at 140 km/h, which makes it hurricane 1 category, and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, above the Pacific is created a low pressure area and moves towards the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baya California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture towards the northwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in Mexico on Monday.
The tropical moisture in the interaction with a nearer low pressure area will then cause strong declines in the large part of the southwest.
In local areas of 25 to 100 mm rain will cause dangerous floods, mud floods and possible slippers in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will cause a rainfall that will be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in certain places, especially in the parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Even 25 to 100 mm rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above the largest part of Arizona.
Possible floods are by rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spreading nature of tropical rain.
There is no advice to go to the desert of walking because of the danger of tropical destruction.
The strong rain could turn canyons into wild rivers, and the thunderflows with thunderstorms will bring local winds and dust whirlwinds.
The closer to the low pressure area will bring local strong rains on the parts of the coast of southern California.
The quantity of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause less mud and slippery roads.
It will be the first decline in the wet season in this region.
The dissolved tropical plugs will start approaching Arizona on Sunday late night and Monday early morning before at the end of Monday and cover the wider area on Tuesday.
The strong rain will expand on Tuesday to the area where the borders of the federal states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are touching and lasting all day on Wednesday.
In October there are great temperature changes around the United States how the Arctic is colding, but the tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes it leads to dramatic temperature changes at small distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The difference in the temperature between Kansas City in Missouri, Omahe in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the summer heat will continue to grow and spread again.
In most Central and East United States, it is expected that the beginning of October will be warm from 27 degrees from the Southern plains to the parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great possibility of supernatural temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people were watching Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people looked at six television networks on Thursday, a tense testimony of candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual attack that allegedly happened in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political account continued, and the rapporteurs interrupted the regular programme to notify the turning at the last minute of Friday: the agreement reached by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, that the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation of the charge.
Ford told the Senate court committee that Kavanaugh was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh touched her in a drunk state and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In a zealous testimony, Kavanaugh stated that he was absolutely sure that it didn’t happen.
The hearing on Friday was probably followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number listed in the Nelsen report.
The company counted the average number of the watchers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediately available number of viewers for other networks transmitting the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And the Nelsen company usually has difficulties measuring the number of people who look at the contents in the offices.
In order to make it better for you, it's about audience that is, in number, similar to the one watching the American football or the Oscar's assignment.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the study strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the largest number of audiences with a average of 5,69 million during the whole day hearing, reported from Nelsen.
ABC took the second place with 3.26 million viewers.
The Nelsen company reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.2 million.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in the drama that was going on Friday.
After the office of that moderate Republican announced that they would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning as the demonstrators shouted at him while he was trying to leave the elevator for a hearing of the Justice Committee.
For a few minutes, he was standing in a broken eye while the demonstration cameras in front of CNN were spinning him.
"I stand here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth of this country?"
They said to him: “You have power as many women are helpless. ”
Flake said his office had issued a statement before the elevator's door closed that he would say more at the committee's hearing.
A few hours later, all cables and television networks monitored live when the Justice Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to vote the entire Senate.
But Flake said that it would only be done provided that the FBI explored charges against candidates during the next week, as required by the democrats in the minority.
Flake was partly convinced to talk to a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.

Conflict of police and catalonic separatists to meet the anniversary of the independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrators defending independence confronted with the intervention police and after thousands of people joined the anti-demostry to mark the catalonic polarizing vote on untipation.
A group of masked separatists who have been facing intervention police began to shoot cops with eggs and barbecue, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that would otherwise be flooded by tourists.
The fights exploded later during the day the police used their sticks to calm the fight.
During a few hours, groups defending independence scanded "No forgets, no forgiveness," and unionists cried against them "Spain Long Live".

The tensions in the independence region have not eclipsed a year after the referendum of October 1st which Madrid declared illegal and which the Catalonians are separatists of glory.
The large majority of voters have decided to be independent, although the exit was small, because those who were opposed to untied mostly bounce the voting.
According to the catalon authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in harsh conflicts last year after the police tried to stop the vote in votes across the region.
The independence teams spent on Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations from supporting the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to move the second route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended separatist demonstrations along with his wife said he no longer hopes that Catalonia will receive independence.
"We have experienced one of the best moments in the past years.
I watched my parents cry from happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they have achieved a key, although the close victory of the regional elections last December, the catalonic independence party is difficult this year, because their most famous leaders are in a self-incorporated exile or in custody waiting for a trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said that the conflict has motivated politicians to both sides.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalonic leaders who announced since the end of the last year's investigation prison that he would run for the European Parliament's elections next year.
"European election candidate is the best way we can declare the regression of democratic values and repress that we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.

It's possible that at some point the car was shot by a gunshot.
Menge hit brought Livingstone victory over the Rangers with result 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston has won.
The new Scotland Premiership League Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to acknowledge his only second defeat from 18 games in the Ibrox Club.
The hit of Dolly Menge turned out to be decisive while Gary Holt's team in a second settled with the Iberian.
Gerrard's team is still without winning the guests in Premiership this season, and next Saturday they play against Hearts, the leading club in the League where eight points remain.
Before that, the Rangers, as part of the European League, will accompany the Rapid Vienna Club on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, increased his series of wins to six games, and Chief Coach Holt still failed since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the chances against the embarrassed guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they reached that hit, since their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke himself, but it was too slow on the way toward the naked, and then Alan Lithgow could only guide the ball wide after slipping down to intercept the head of Craig Halkett to the naked.
The hosts willingly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause guest difficulties.
And that's how the key naked is achieved.
The Rangers missed to stop a free blow, and Livingston designed the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisted Mengi who hit the middle of the naked.
Until that moment, the Rangers mostly had control of the ball, but they faced an inexplosive domestic defense, so the golman Liam Kelly had nothing to do.
That went on in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the punch.
The golman's legs of Rangers Allan McGregor prevented Scott Pittman, and Lithgow directed a broad strike from another organized attack of Livingstone.
The long adding failed to cross the naked line of Livingstone, and no two one-esters were condemned – after Halkett's conflict with the substitute player Glen Middleton and one for playing hands.
"Great" from Livingstone – Analysis
Alasdar Lamont from Scotland BBC in Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent game and the result of Livingstone.
Everyone was excellent, and they continued to overcome the expectations on that input path.
Their style of games and staff barely changed since they returned to large clubs, but the great credit goes to Holt and the way he united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant on the head of the greatly organised defense, and Menga didn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Worral have a rest during the whole game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set up a good game under Gerrard.
They just opened a hole in the home team once, and it's a kind of call for the Rangers in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Koeln
On Saturday (September 29th) all was full of smiles under the sky when Turce and German leader met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of a controversial visit to President Erdogan to Germany -- whose aim is to correct relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed in the opinions on issues involving human rights, press freedom and accession of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Koeln to open a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish population lives in that city outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police blocked a mass of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but nearby a large number of president's supporters came to see him.
And hundreds of demonstrators of the opponent Erdogan -- of which a large number of Kurds – raised their vote by condemning Erdogan's policy and decisions of the German government to welcome him with a welcome welcome in the country.
The controversial demonstration reflects the division caused by a visitor some German Turks glorify as a hero, while others attack as a autokrat.
Deptford road crash: a bicycle victim died in a car crash
A bikeman died in a crash with a car in London.
The crash occurred near the district of Bestwood Street and Evelyn, on the road with a dense transport in Deptford in the southeast of town around 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance arrived, but the man died in the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after the death of another bikeman after the crash and the escape of the driver from the accident in Chiders Street, about a mile and a half from the Saturday scene of accident.
The city police reported that police officers were trying to identify a man and inform his closest family.
Due to the accident, roads were closed and bus traffic has been redirected, and the drivers of motor vehicles are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: Six police officers injured in trouble
The prison office reported that six police officers were injured in an unrest in a man's prison of a detainee.
The disturbances exploded in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and still last.
Special Tornado troops have been brought to address the disturbances that include eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
The police officers on the spot were provided with help due to smaller face injuries.
The Prison Service spokesman said: "The prison personnel has been specially trained to solve the incident in prison Long Lartin.
Six staff members have received assistance for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we want to make clear that all responsible people will be dedicated to the police and that they can spend longer time behind bars."
There are over 500 prisoners in Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison manager ended up in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, an intervention police was invited to prison to solve the serious situation in which the staff was attacked by billboard balls.
Uragan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City by floods (possible benefits for dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizon, but there is a chance that this will happen at the beginning of the next week when the hurricane of Rosa crosses the desert southwest and brings the danger of buic floods.
The National Hydrometeoroological Service has already issued warnings on buic floods for Monday and Tuesday in the West Arizona area, across southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utaha, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should come close to Phoenix late on Monday along the rain and go straight over it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeoral Service in Phoenix stated in its tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones brought a tropical storm or depression within 320 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
The hurricane of Katrina went 40 miles from the Arizona border in 1967."
The latest model of the National Centre for Hurricanes foresees 50 to 100 mm declines, with isolated quantities up to 150 mm on the Mogollon border of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Stone and the Great Pool, there is a probability of 25 to 50 mm decline, with possible isolated total amounts up to 100 mm.
For those outside the danger of the floods, Rosa could come as a rescue because the region was hit by drought.
Although floods are a great danger, a part of these declines could be useful because the jugowest government is currently dry.
"As the American dry map of the dry areas, a little more than 40% of Arizona was hit by at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com announced.
The trip of the hurricane first approached the coast along the Mexican Peninsula of Baya California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of hurricane with the maximum wind speed of 130 km/h and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving north at 20 km per hour.
The storm encountered the coldest waters of the Pacific, so it weakened you.
It is therefore expected that on Monday afternoon or evening the coast of Mexico will be closer to the force of the tropical storm.
The rain in the parts of Mexico could be strong and constitutes a significant danger of a flood emergence.
"The amount of total declines expected in the area from Baja California to Northwest Sonore is 75 to 150 mm, possible maximum 250 mm," weather.com announced.
Rosa will then go north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona early in the morning Tuesday as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and South Utah by Tuesday late night.
"The main danger expected from Rose or its remains is very strong rain in Baya California, north-western Sonore and the US Southwest," the National Centre for Hurricanes reported.
These rains are expected to cause the life of dangerous floods and floods of mud in the deserts and slippers in the mountain area.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempting murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-olds were arrested for suspicion of attempts to kill after a 16-year-old in Summerset found a stab wound.
About 04.00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, a teenager was found injured.
He's taken to the hospital, and he's stable.
The police administration of Avon and Somerset announced that 17-year-old, 2 18-year-old and 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the area of Radstock.
The police officers invited everyone who's got a recording of the events.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh suffered anger and anger of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the Wheeling pre-electoral meeting in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "tolerated anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination procedure.
On Thursday, Kavanauh testified before the Congress and determinedly and emotionally rejected the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford for sexual assault several decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing of the accusation she filed.
The President said on Saturday that day "the American people saw the brilliantness, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, the judge with a perfect career in public service," he said to the collected supporters in Western Virginia.
The President touched Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of the Republicans' elections at half the presidential mandate.
"Five weeks divide us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I am," he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the democratic mission was to "prove resistance and obstructions".
The assistant of the Republican leadership said to CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of death victims in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to grow
The competent authorities stated on Saturday that at least 384 people had suffered death, from which a large number of of waves that hit the coast when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island Sulawes.
Thousands of people gathered together at the beach festival in Palo on Friday, when the waves of the waves up to six meters of the shore in the dark, dragging many of them to death and destroying everything on their way.
Cunami followed after the magnitude seven-fifth earthquake.
"When the cunami danger appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately and have been killed," said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesian Agency to mitigate the consequences of the BNPB disaster at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he dragged with him cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami crossed the open sea at 800 km/h before he hit about the coast.
"Some people climbed into trees to escape the cunamis and survived," he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Paluo.
The air photographs published by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and stores, distorted and destroyed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The subsequent hits continued to shake that coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in a area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Applying Agency (BPPT) announced in its statement that the energy released by a huge earthquake on Friday corresponded to the two-stople power of the atomic bomb thrown in Hiroshim in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of a long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of cunamics.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were crashed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found captured under the ruins of buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of victims and damages may be greater along the coast of 300 miles north of Palua, in the area called Donggala and closer to the epicentre of earthquakes.
"The communications are completely broken and we have no information from Donghal."
"In this area more than 300,000 people live," says the Red Cross statement in which the staff and volunteers are added to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could be much worse," the statement states.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for the lack of information that the tsunami hit Palo, although officials claim that the waves arrived at the moment the warning was issued.
In the amateur video divided on social networks, it can be heard that a man on the top floor of the building panicically warns people down on the street of the coming tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall fell down on the coast, carrying buildings and cars with him.
Reuters' agency couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused the absence of electricity that caused the discontinuation of communications around Palua, which made the competent people difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the military began sending cargo aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still needed food and other necessary estate.
The city airport has been reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Paluo on Saturday.
Cunami in Indonesia took over 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"Although the staff of the World Vision Organization from Donghale has successfully arrived in the city of Palo where employees are placed in the tarpoulin tents placed in the courtyard of their office, they have passed the scenes of destruction on the road," Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw numerous destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched wheels of help in the disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise have been disabled from arrival in Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supply and employment of staff from other countries can only begin if the scene of accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Ariani, speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'All right, this is a national disaster', we can receive international assistance, but such a situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of those who are still considered missing still hoped that their beloved would be one of those miracles that mitigate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
Saturday, the boy was saved from the sewer.
On Saturday, saviors released a woman who was trapped under ruins next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian state paraglaider team, trained two missing paraglaiders for Asian games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his students.
"Because of many years spent in paraglaiding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after the news about the crash of Roa Roa Roa, which extended to the paraglaider community, he desperately sent whatsApp messages to competitions from Palua who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a grey quack, instead of with two blue quakes.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves took 26.750 US dollars while filling bankomates in Newport Centre on the Levee
The thieves stole 26,750 dollars from Brink's employee who filled a bankomat in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, says a press release for Newport police administration.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said that the car driver was emptyed by a bankomate in a fun complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with it, another man "in the race came to Brink's employee behind his back" and stole a bag with the money that was to put in the bankomate.
The witnesses noticed a number of suspicious people fleeing from the stealing scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Everyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: raper changes the name in Ye
Raper Kanye West will change the name in Ye.
In the Saturday publication on Twitter, he wrote: “Live will be officially known as Kanye West. ”
West (41) has a name Ye for a while and has used it as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change comes in front of his visit in the Saturday Night Live show in which it is expected to launch its new album Yandhi.
Emergency authors said he replaced Ariana Grande's singer who canceled for "emotional reasons".
Except that it was a shortcut to his current art name, West said earlier that the word had religious meaning for him.
"I believe that the word 'ye' is most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ye'," West said earlier this year in a discussion on his album title with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, that's us.
It came from Kanya, which means “one,” in only Ye – it is a reflection of good, bad, confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's one in a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And the former West's associate, JAY-Z, played with the versions of his name without a drawing and a drawing and a large letter written.
Mexican AMLO promised that they would not use the army against citizens.
The candidate for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against citizens while the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge over students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on the Tlatelolco Square that "he will never use the army against the Mexican people."
Military troops fired during peaceful demonstrations on that square on October 2, 1968 and killed about 300 people at the time the left student movements began to spread by Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those studying and opening a larger number of free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education attracts young criminal gangs.
United States should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"Because China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount invested in research in this area," the investor in artificial intelligence and expert for this area Kai Fu Lee who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
That comment followed after the various parts of the US government announced plans on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. basically lacks a formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal was to become the first country in the AI innovation number by 2030.
"Double increase in the research budget in artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States and we are looking for the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"The double increase in investment could double the chances that next major achievements in the field of artificial intelligence will come in the United States," Lee said this week in the CNBC talk.
Lee whose book was: “AI velesile: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, director of Sinovation Ventures, who invests in one of the most extensive AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon worked at the University of Carnegie Mellon at the AI system that won the best American player in the game Othello, and later he was director at the Microsoft Research Department and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee commended the previous technological competitions of the US government, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked the question when the next will be held in order to find new visioners.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get public scholarships.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on researching artificial intelligence over the past years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the United States to encourage their efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that doctors in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council published the Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
"The Chinese National Fund for Natural Science provides funds to persons in academic institutions like the National Fund for Science and Other State Organizations provide funds to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established the Joint Intelligence Centre, whose purpose is to include partners from activities and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Art Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, he currently invests more than 100 million dollars a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the American legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Art Intelligence has not done anything for months.
Macedonians vote at a referendum to change their country's name
Macedonia's citizens voted on Saturday on the referendum whether they wanted to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia. This is a move that could solve the dispute with Greece that lasted for decades, which has blocked Greece's opening negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that its northern neighbour's name represents its own territory and has invested a veto to the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments agreed in June about the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the most Slovenian population of Macedonia.
President Gjorhe Ivanov said they would not vote at the referendum, and the voting boycott campaign raised doubts whether the output would fill the minimum 50 per cent required to be valid.
The issue at the referendum voting list was: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with accepting agreement with Greece?"
Calling supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price worth paying to Macedonia, one of the countries emerging after the breakdown of Yugoslavia, has allowed access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia to live freely under the scope of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," Olivera Georgievska (79) said in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote was not legally binding, enough members of Parliament said they would respect it so that it would be considered decisive.
Change of name requires a two-third majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no irregularities have been reported until 13:00.
However, the output was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters were voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gose Tanevski, a voter from Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and Dusko's son, joined the country's referendum on September 30, 2018, opening the path to NATO's accession to the Union and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov before the parliament in Skopje set a small stage and received chairs in front of the tents set by those who boycott referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring so much necessary investment to Macedonia, a country where unemployment rate exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe the majority will support the referendum, since more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the "positive" result would be "the confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43% of voters will access the referendum, which is under the necessary response.
The second survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57% of the respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
From that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
In order to be successful, the output must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious strike to pro-western government politics since it took the mandate in May last year.
Look: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero is passing through the entire defense of Brighton to reach a hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England, broke Brighton's defense and for Manchester City victory with results 2 : 0.
Aguero made the victory crazy simple, reaching a hit in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received adding in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton's defense players and then reached the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four opponent players in green shirts.
He circled around one defender, and then reached a few more on the edge of Brython's space.
Then he added the ball to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguer, who put the right-handed ball on the right side of the network and defeated the Brighton gateman Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some difficulties with the foot," the journalists reported the manager Manchester City, Pep Guardiola.
"We planned to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he made a hit at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Bluesim the initial advantage of the Prime Minister League.
That hit was reached in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball deep in Brighton's field during this game.
He beautifully added the ball to Leroy Sane along the left side.
Sane pushed the ball a few times before Sterling was guided to the stativa.
The Sky Blues attacker put the ball into the net net before slipping into the car.
Manchester City fights Hoffenheim in the group game of the League of Champions on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Aren stadium in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable Rockies' progress
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from the arrival, there was no too much reason to insist on a new start.
But always a contested Scherzer hopes for a week's victory against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West, are in a game.
Rockies at Friday night victory from 5 : 2 over the Nationals at least secured a place in the wild-card finish, but still hope to win their first title.
"Although we're playing for nothing, we can at least throw out the atmosphere here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would testify this year.
Why don't I want to compete?"
Nationals still have to publish a Sunday starter, but apparently in that case they are inclined to offer Scherzer to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34st start, warmed up on Thursday in the castle space and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The rightman from Washington in this season achieved the result from 18 : 7, the average of winning races (ERA) from 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 twenty-third changes.
Trump at a meeting in Western Virginia
During the talk on the importance of the release of the Republican voters to the general elections, the President commented on his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court of Justice.
"All we have done will be tested in November.
It's five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the great, big - I'm not running, but I'm actually in a race and that's why I'm everywhere, to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of democrats, you see it happens right now.
Their intention is to reopen the power in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, whom they have to go over to take over the power and control; they therefore want the government and control; we will not give them."
Democrats say they have a mission "disturbed and distracted".
"You have seen this during the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "anger, evil, corrupt and liar."
He addressed the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein from the Senate Justice Committee by name, which caused a loud disrespect of the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you released the document in public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for a document -- it was really a bad body speech, the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
The labour party no longer considers different opinions.
Do not tolerate the exposition of personal opinions
It didn't surprise me too much when the Momentum Activists in my local party voted to censure me.
Finally, I am the last in the series of representatives of the Labourist Party who have been told that they are not welcome – and all because we have said what we have in mind.
According to my associate, Joan Ryan has taken the same thing because she has decisively opposed anti-semitism.
I was criticised in the censorship proposal for disagreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, the ironicly similar topics of which Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the preliminary leadership.
At the notification of the meeting of the Labourist Party East on Friday, it was stated that "we want the meetings to be included and productive".
Most of the eight years during which I work as a local representative of the Laburist Party, the meetings of the Chief Council on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings have been held in a different tone, and the promise of “nearest, gentle ” politics has long been forgotten if its fulfillment has ever started.
It has become more obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Laburist Party, and every opinion is estimated on the basis of whether it is acceptable by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, since the associates I believed that we share similar political opinions from me began to require a dramatic change in my views and the adoption of attitudes that I would never agree with -- whether it was a national security or a unique EU market.
Whenever I speak to the public -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- there is a lot of insulting words on social networks that call on my response, which deny the policy of the center and tells me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I've had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that are mostly political to me.
I admire the professionality and determination of colleagues who daily face the lavina of sexist or racist comments, but never fail.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me most is tolerating an insulting speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Laburist Party should promote the culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer consider different opinions and that with every proposal for untrusting or changing the election rules, we become increasingly disadvantaged parties.
They've advised me many times in the last two years to move my head, not to be so loud, and to tell me that everything will be fine."
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since 32 years ago, as a student, I joined the Laburist Party, incentived by ignoring the government Margaret Thatcher, who left my school multi-school class, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – either as a local council or minister in the government.
I've never hid my policy, nor at the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East could be misguided about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would have told those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at the moment the country grabs the Brexit that will negatively reflect on households, companies and public services, I do not understand the desire of losing time and energy to my loyalty to the leadership of the Labourist Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my election units, whether it is the members of the Laburist Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats to return or political benefit will distract me from acting as I think it is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 Undefeated Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat affected the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this extremely interesting game of the day in the Tennent's Premiering League.
Now they're on the top of the ladder, and they're the only unbeaten of ten teams.
Finally, the top defense and the better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"They have already tested us at every game and we are still unbeaten, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose Club, said: “Everything Ayra, they have used opportunities better than us. ”
The attempt of Grant Anderson in the 14th minute that was implemented by Frazier Climo led Ayr, but the yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game of Warriors, enabled Melrose to raise the results, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Climo has increased the leadership of Ayra with one-ester before, in the mid-time, he has reached a hit and made an independent attempt to change the result for Ayra in 17 : 5 at the time of the break.
But the second half - time Melrose started well, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, decreased the advantage of five points.
Then there was a long break due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott who was taken on the carpets, and when the game continued, Ayr continued a good game by attempting Stafford McDowall who realized Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card and Melrose rebuilt an additional player to pay, and that unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to destroy the Clima which had no ball; from a line for a punishment struck, MacPherson made a layout behind Ayr in a full swing of a breakdown.
Climo realized that he did it almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high hit from David Armstrong and sent a side player Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the home team.
The series star Still Game seems ready for a new career in restaurant activity
Ford Kiernan, a series star Still Game, seems ready to continue working in service activities after it was discovered that he was appointed Director of the Licensed Restaurants Company.
56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the favorite BBC series whose scenario is and one of the stars, along with a long-year-old comedian partner, Greg Hemphill.
Two men announced that the coming ninth season will be the last one to show, and it seems Kiernan is planning to devote life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress refused to comment on the story, although one source for Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to participate in "a growing restaurant in Glasgow".
"The sea is ours," Bolivia, who has no way out to the sea, hopes that the court will award her an exit to the Pacific
Navy patrols a sea centre filling a elevator in La Paz.
A flag of ocean color has been reported in public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicac to Amazon are the wingers: “We have the right to sea.
It's our duty to return it."
In the entire Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, the memory of the lost sea coast for Chile during the 19th century's conflict with resources is still alive – just like the desire for the removing of the Pacific.
While Bolivia awaits the verdict of the International Court of Justice expected on October 1, after the five-year procedure, and hopes may be at the highest level in the past decades.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, optimisticly expects the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The crowd of Bolivians throughout the country will look at the verdict of the International Court of Justice on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the withdrawal of a sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Here's Morales, a Bolivian carismatic autochtonic president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from the verdict on Monday.
"We are near the return of the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge in favour of Bolivia and that there would be little changes if it were.
The UN body with a headquarters in the Netherlands has no authority to allocate the Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The verdict of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final hearing means that the case was "not complex," said Paz Zarate, Chilean expert for international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have been reversed.
"The question of access to the sea has adopted the Bolivian leadership at the moment," Zarate said.
Morales' war-born rhetoric buried every good will of Chile, he thinks.
Bolivia and Chile will continue dialogue at a time, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
Those two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Weltzé, a Bolivian representative in Hague, disagrees with the view that the court made an unusual decision quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "incorrect opportunity to start a new period in relation to Chile" and the opportunity to "close 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denyed that Morales -- still one of the favorite presidents in Latin America -- used the maritime question as a political stack.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea said there would be no nuclear disarmament if she couldn't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclearly disarmad unless he could trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He invited the United States to keep the promises of the day during the meeting of the leaders of these two opponent countries in Singapore.
He commented at a moment when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be inclined to restart diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, which comes over three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Una.
Ri said sanctions continued because of "free dreams" and that the opposition to the US declaration of the ending of the Korean war will certainly not put North on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pjongjang first to take concrete steps to disarmament.
Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want to meet at the top.
However, scepticism is widely present about the serious intention of Pyongyang to renounce the arsenal that this country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.

If you want to improve your collection of hats or fully cover the sun, don't look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the fashion track presented a line of diverted large covers for their spring and summer collection in 2019 and admired the familiars of style in Paris Week Mode.
Extraordinarily irregular hats this summer moved Instagram, and these designers sent their creatives that attract attention to the flight.
The example that was highlighted was designed by Valentino, and it was a large bež hat decorated by a wide circle like a feather that completely "whispered" of the model's head.
Other glomaz supplements included jewelry, magic hat, and even ananas, but these supplements are not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented the collection of bizarre masks – tight in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had sewed lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than parts of high fashion.

The exhaust orange bag of rafia, decorated by rafia and white skin lunch, was an exhibition in the summer collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera for 2019 at Paris Week Mode.
The style of famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told F.EMAIL: “I expect large hats and bags for the beach in luxury stores for the summer. Since the designer has left such a strong impression, it would be hard to ignore the demand for large fashion supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills the citizens of the world need
Scotland independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of extraordinary test results, and the additional weight of it gives individual and common success in sports, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools representing the Scotland Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and high education, career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can design and implement the school course, we see that modern languages continue to be the favorite and desired object chooses in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in your mother's tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot only use English if we want to build trust and relations with persons from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the most linguistic evaluations have been achieved by students of independent schools.
A total of 68% of the students who learned foreign languages received excellent evaluations.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of the students received an excellent evaluation for the mandarin language, while 72% of the students learning German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of students learning Spanish also received the maximum possible evaluation.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as elections are considered as important as STEM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the course of independent schools, as well as in other places.
The United Kingdom Employment and Skills Survey, held in 2014, revealed that 17% of employees cannot fill jobs because of the lack of workforce with language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly impetus for the preparation of young people for career.
Since the linguistic knowledge is required in more jobs, skills are crucial in a globalized world.
Regardless of the choice of career, people who have learned to speak foreign language in the future will feel the advantages of such long-term skills.
A person speaking more languages can communicate directly with foreigners, which gives it the advantage of competition.
According to a YouGov survey in 2013, in which more than 4000 adults participated, 75% of those in the United Kingdom do not know the foreign language enough to communicate on it, and the French is the only language that speaks a bisignific percentage of the subjects, more accurately 15% of them.
Therefore, investment in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, every school offers various languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their own programme, while others will decide for languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom of 2020, for example mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, independent schools will always have a variety of choices, as well as a training personnel in this area.
Scotland’s independent schools provide children with an environment in which they will prepare and arm the skills needed for success, no matter what the future is preparing for us.
It cannot be ignored that today, global business, knowledge of language is very important for the future of each country so that it must also reflect on education.
So knowledge of modern languages should indeed be seen as “international communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer language, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Council of Scottish independent schools
LeBron will play in Lakers' dress for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans will soon welcome LeBron James's first show for Lakers from Los Angeles.
Coach of Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first seasonal game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.

"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told Lakers' official page.
The reporter of Lakers Mike Trudell published a tweet that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training at the beginning of this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans in Lakers, consisting of six games.
"In this stage of career, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump maintains a meeting in Western Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a campaign with numerous meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not voted yet for the new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the coming elections because there is a danger that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress after the vote in November.
What time does Trump's meeting in West Virginia start tonight, and how can you look at it on the network?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia was scheduled in 19 hours at eastern time tonight, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's meeting in Western Virginia you can look online through a stream live on YouTube.
Trump will probably comment on this weekly hearing of a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh who has caused disputes for sexual abuse.
But the primary goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans achieve the advantage of the elections in November.
Accordingly, the Bureau of Trump for the Presidential campaign reports that five meetings scheduled for the next week have to "simple volunteers and agree because the Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the Protection House," reports Reuters.
"The majority in Congress is so important to the president's plans that they will travel to as many countries as possible while we enter a burning campaign," the ananymous speaker of Trump's campaign told Reuters.
The tonight's meeting in Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could attract supporters from "Ohhia and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh", reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit Western Virginia for the second time in the past month. In 2016, he won with more than 40 percent points.
Trump is trying to help the candidate of the Republicans for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who is behind in the surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to help him improve the rank in the surveys," politician Simon Haedar from the University of West Virginia for Reuters said.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team left the heart on the ground before individual crashes on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, a couple breakdown on Sunday afternoon may have been exactly what it was about to turn Ryder Cup.
The "Wheel of Happiness Turns" is the saying that is especially worth sports and which sportsmen believe, and especially in competitions like this.
Who's the bike of happiness now favored?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think happiness is now on our side," Jordan Spieeth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are in advantage with four points, while 12 points remain to the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their back and encouraging his game with Justin Thomas, with which after the whole day's game they won three out of four points.
Spieth played murderally from tee to green and could serve as an example for the others.
The cheerleading celebration shouts were increasingly loud when Spieeth and Thomas reached two points of remnant, and everything culminated by the key path by which Spieeth came to an unsolved result.
After the way he won the game with 15 holes, a similar cheerleading scream came in which the hope and belief that the Americans can turn everything around.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
These players are all that's left now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup Sensation.
The European strange, but irresistible couple has a maximum number of points and can't make mistakes.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose a score on Saturday afternoon, but he also escaped Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This victory series, as well as an incredible energy linking Fleetwood and Molinaria show that they are the only players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two of them who can seal the winning of the Europeans while the sun goes over Paris Le Golf National.
Maybe they'll both take the win at the same time on different holes.
But it's too early to talk about the winning of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly hit Alex Noren and Sergei Garcia who had a great performance in the morning's game of couples.
One godey and two double godeys on the first nine holes in the playground buried the Spanish and Sweden in a hole from which they failed to dig.
However, there will be no one to help individuals dig out of their hole on Sunday.
It is fascinating to watch the games of couples closely because you can see the interactions of the players in a pair, to hear the advice they give and those that don't give, as well as to study a strategy that can change at the moment.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they enter with significant privileges, but this game in couples has also shown that the US team has the necessary resistance, which some, especially States, have doubted.
Europeans on the last day Ryder Cupa enter with guidance from 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday games in couples in the last day Ryder Cupa enter with a significant advantage over the United States of 10 :6.
The dynamic duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods took four points of difference at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn in the effort to win the trophy that escaped her in Hazeltine two years ago was more powerful than the US Morning Team in couples with the results of 3 : 1.
The American team has shown greater resistance in couples by wining two games, but the difference in points has already been large.
To conquer the trophy teams, Jim Furyk should collect eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first debitant from the European team who won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", after the sensational weekend only another couple who won four points in the games in the Ryder Cupa history.
After they defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they showed themselves to be superior in the game against Woods and US debitant Bryson Dechambeau by victory of 5&4.
Woods who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games has made some genius moves, but now he has 19 defeats from 29 games in fourballs and couples and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs so that he and his partner Henrik Stanson returned to play with couples and lost 2&1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
However, the Europeans did not do anything like a convenience during a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
The triple winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday and thus set up a ladder high to their American team.
First they defeated Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter by 2&1 in fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McLroy with 4&3 in couples after the first two holes lost.
Twice in history, the Ryder Cupa team that was behind four points managed to return in individual games, although Furyk's team needs only an unsolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days in restraint, they seem to have a hard week's contrast.
North Korea announced that "no chance" for unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister Saturday said to the United Nations that further sanctions increase confidence in the United States and that there is no way that North Korea will unilaterally disarma and give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, demonstrated the nuclear station for testing and decided to stop nuclear technology and weapons development.
"But, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
"If we don't trust in the United States, we have no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that the first one will disarm ourselves unilaterally."
Although Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea on Washington's resistance to the “consolidated” approach to denuclearisation within which North Korea would gradually eliminate sanctions, his statement is significant because he did not reject the unilateral denuclearization of what Pyongjang was doing in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump's joint statement at the first meeting in the history of the current President of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean war that took place from 1950 to 1953, but the United States provided that Pyongjang would be renounced by nuclear weapons before that.
Washington has also ignored calls for a reduction of strict international sanctions for North Korea.
"The U.S. insists that the denuclearisation should be done before that and increase the pressure through sanctions in order to force its goal, and even oppose the "pronouncement of the end of the war", Ri added.
"The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is just a mistake of people who don't know anything about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases the lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for the second meeting of Kim and Trump about which the US President spoke at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in held even three meetings in the last five months and added: "If Denuclearisation had been requested by South Korea, rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stop."
Regardless of all, the tone of the speech of Minister Rio differed greatly from last year when he spoke before the UN Main Assembly and said that the targeting of the United States' continental missiles was inevitable after the wicked President Trump called Kim "the man of a missile" on a suicidal mission.
The Trump, who threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea last year, praised Kim in the United Nations for his courage to disarmament, but added that there was much more work to do and that sanctions had to remain in force until North Korea performed the denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no time frame for denuclearisation and he added: “It doesn't matter if it take two years, three or five months.”
China and Russia expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for measures taken.
However, US Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "Implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until the complete, final and verified denuclearisation comes."
The Security Council unanimously introduced sanctions for North Korea in 2006 attempting to stop the financing of the nuclear and ballistic programme in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ree in the UN headquarters and then said he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not good.
He left Pjongjang in July and said progress was made, but North Korea called him after a few hours for "gangster demands".
North Korea arranged a meeting with Moon this month to deflect the missile location and nuclear complex that will be achieved if the United States take "suitable measures".
He added that Kim discovered that these "suitable measures" relate to the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and some steps to stabilize relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard attend a course to learn how to rest well
A new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to sleep well in trying to fight more widespread learning culture with caffeine and unsleep nights.
The Academy found that students in the world's best university often have no idea of the grounds for caring for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a sleep professor at the Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course that he considers the first of those species in the United States.
On the idea of the course, he came after he talked about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached me and said, "Why did I learn this just now, at the last year of college?"
She said no one told her how important a dream is, which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course held for the first time this year explains to students how good sleeping habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
The Psychiatric Professor at the Harvard Medical Faculty and the Executive Director of the Health Service of the University of Paul Barreira said that the University decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep was observed in the students during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a student bedroom on which students need to click on cups of coffee, curtains, tennis, and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how lack of sleep affects success and how important the routine of sleep is.
During the lecture, students also find out how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, brain attacks, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus map with interactive icons that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the conduct of the students will not be changed immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just like you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," said Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride to all night learning before the examination continues to exist, says professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that the lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Professor says that the secret weapons of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality dream. Sleep helps also in fighting thickness because the lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it into the famine and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student in California, helped Professor Cheisler develop a course after he attended his lectures at the first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand courses to the whole campus.
As the next step, he plans to ask all graduates to complete a similar study subject before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommends that students include alarm during sleep, as well as during awakening. They must be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit displays of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disturb the circuit rhythm and cause problems with dream.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin gol defeated Gerard's boys
The Rangers have suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge hits the lack of defense of Steven Gerrard and finished the game with Livingstone's victory with the result 1 : 0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win the first victory after the triumph in February and results 4 : 1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games, so his team now remains eight points in Ladbrokes Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Menga reached the event seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers seemed to have lost their inspiration and it didn't seem to be equal to the result.
While the Rangers now fell to the sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third with only one event of the difference behind Hibernian.
There might be new problems for Rangers after a linear judge Calum Spence got a head injury when a subject was thrown out of the distance.
Gerrard made eight shifts on the sides and so sneaked by the Ayr to the semifinal Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same position of Livingstone that Hearts took the measure last week and would be thrilled to see his well-designed position choked every attempt of the opponent.
The Rangers may have had a ball in possession more, but Livingston has achieved more with it.
They had a chance to hit two minutes after Menga was first thrown out of the game that opened the space for Scott Pittman to move towards Allan McGregor's naked, however, the collar missed that opportunity.
The deep free strike of Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive companion Alan Lithgow could only pass an unprecise strike towards the back lines.
Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game, they seemed to play with hope rather than with confidence.
Alfredo Morelos surely felt that the judge should have bothered him with one-ester in 15 minutes after his crash with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not respect the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were able to guide only two balls to the naked, but the former Ibrox gateway, Liam Kelly, one hit by the head of Lassana Coulibaly, and the pitom hit of Ovie Ejaria, was not a big problem.
Although the 34-minute game of Livingstone slowed the game, no one can deny their efforts.
The Rangers missed again using the deep Jacobs back ball.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his presence and chose Menga for a simple end of the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had the current effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the game they enjoy, while Lithgow and Halkett had a long blow after another.
Holt's side could have prolonged leadership in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a broad trip out of the corner.
Rangers' substitute, Glenn Middleton, once again late, was looking for a one-ester because he stumbled with Jacobs, but Thomson and this time he turned his eye.
Almanah: Inventor of Geiger's Counter
And now the page from our Almanah in the Sunday Morning show: on September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago...the day of birth of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactiveness, and from that invention later a device was developed known as Geiger's numerator.
The main base of science since that time, Geiger's counter became also the main spot of pop culture, for example in the film “Bells of Colorado” in 1950, in which the main roles seemed to have played incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man: "What is that, for God's sake?"
Rogers: “It is Geiger's counter, and it is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these phones on, you can actually hear atoms that react to radioactiveness in minerals."
Evans: “Look, you hear it! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that wears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system that as part of the treatment recognises bad cells
The procedure includes the extraction of immune system cells from the patient and their changes in the laboratory
The cells are treated so that they can "recognize" protein that is common to many cancer species and then reinject to the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with an immune system to recognize bad cells, the egg cancer has withdrawn over 18 months.
The procedure includes extraction of the immune system cells from the patient, their change in the lab so that they know "recognized" protein called HER2 common to many types of cancer and reinjecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine. ”
HER2 encourages growth in several types of cancer, including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and fat womb cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky.
Similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their “learning” to identify cancer cells was successful in treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after a guest in the Saturday Night Live show, participated in the debate on Trump and supported him, wearing a hat with the title "Let America again be great."
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was accompanied in a study during the Saturday Night Live showing the breaks in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would be running for the President of 2020.
After he performed the third song of the night named Ghost Town while he was wearing a hat with the "Let America be again large," he continued to speak against the democrat and repeated to support Trump.
"I talk to white people so often, and they say to me, "How can you like Trump, he's racist."
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The show of Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon laughed at the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Committee for Justice of the United States Senate on the claims of Christine Blasey Ford for sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't transmitted, the video of West's speech to social networks was transferred by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if the announcement of Rock was trying to screw West.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had been thrown behind his stage for the hat he was wearing.
"They bothered me behind the stage.
They told me: “Don't go anywhere with that hat. ”
They've been harassing me!
They said I drowned," Washington Examiner transmitted.
West continued, "You want to see the bottom?" and said that he would wear his Superman's coat because that means that I can't tell him what to do. Do you want the world to progress?
Try with love."
The Variety magazine wrote that his comments were at least twice caused to disturb the audience, and members of the Saturday Night Live show seemed embarrassed, while one person for the magazine said: “The entire studio was silent. ”
West was summoned at the last moment as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, reper Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West performed the song “I love it”, dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, impressed many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the chief of the TPUS Conservative Group, who published on Twitter: “One of the most brave people: Thank you for confronting the mafia. ”
But Karen Hunter's director on Twitter announced that West was simply "he was his own and that it was absolutely wonderful".
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or by supporting his "arts", for whom I believe he accepts and expands ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying he was now "will be officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed Diddy's steps, who was also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the deceased musical legend of Prince changed the name into a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.

The star of the series The throne game Kit Harrington turned on toxic maleness
Kit Harrington is known by the role of Jon Snow, who swords in HBO's violent Mediterranean fantasy Game of the throne.
However, 31 - year - old actor focused on a stereotype of hero macho, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they need to be firm to gain respect.
In a conversation for the newspaper The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married a 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie from the Game of the throne, admitted that he wanted to face this problem very "decisively".
"I personally feel very determined at this moment - where we made a mistake with manhood?" he asked.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, with regard to the problem we now realize?"
Kit believes that TV, thanks to very male characters on screens, could partially be responsible for the growth of toxic maleness.
He continued: “What is born and what was learned?
What are you learning on TV and on the streets and that boys feel like they have to have these certain characters of a man?
I think it's actually one of the great issues of our times -- how can we change it?
'Cause there's obviously something wrong for the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not record the continuations of the throne's game after the end of the next summer and said he "finished with battles and horses".
Since November, Kit will play a new show of True West author Sam Shepard's film producer and his brother's robber.
The actor has recently discovered that he believes that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the game of the throne.
"I met my wife by filming that series, which gave me the family and the future life," he discovered.
Rose was in a fantastic series that won Emmy's reward played the role of Ygritta, the love of the Kitt's character John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% increase in new cases of disease
China announced that by 14% the population living with HIV and AIDS has increased.
Health workers say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
Some 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second three-month 2018.
Most of the new infections are passed by sex, which is a change in the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At the Yunnan Province's conference, the Chinese health authorities stated that people who are infected with HIV in this way are not nearly available.
However, each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
Transfer of HIV by sex is a permanent problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been decriminated in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination is a great LGBT person.
Studies estimate that, due to conservative values in the country, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of disease in such relations occur because of inappropriate protection during sex.
As part of the efforts to face this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denied that a public personnel has filed information on the GOP Senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "theory of conspiracy"
American representative Maxine Walters renounced on Saturday that a member of her staff published the personal information of three Republican American Senators on Wikipedia's pages.
The Democratic Representative of Los Angeles assures that the claims are spreading to individuals of the "ultra right wing", as well as the web sites.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Caroline and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
Information appeared on the network on Thursday, and it was published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate committee on the claims on the sexual offence of the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
Information leaked after the three Senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of the publications belongs to the office of representative Waters, as well as information on the representative member of staff, reported in the The Hill.
"Those unfounded indications are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
“My staff – whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and false indications – is not responsible for leaking these data.
These unfounded indications are completely wrong and absolutely false."
The statement of Ms. Waters quickly attracted criticists on the Internet, including the former spokesman of the White House of Ary Fleischer.
"This is a mad denial," wrote Fleischer.
"This shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of the Congress.
Someone who's been accused of something he didn't have to be angry.
He can't be rude.
He must not question the motives of the defendant.
He must be calm and steady."
It seemed that Fleischer compared Barbara Walters' response to the critics that democrats refer to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate competing in general elections against Waters, also called on Twitter.
"It is important if it is true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office informed the “measurable bodies and order bodies”.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous for my entire office," she continued.
Review of the film “Johny English: Again on mission” – Not enough interesting Rowan Atkinson fights spy
It is now common in every new British movie to look for messages about Brexit, and it appears that it is in the new screening of the Johnny English series, whose first continuation called "Johny English" was first displayed in 2003 and returned to large screens entitled "Johny English" in 2011.
Will your own satir of how obviously we are worthless to become a new national export opportunity?
The incompetent Johnny English's eyes and rubber face again has the permission to complicate the situation, while his name more than anything says it is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where movies aren't in English.
He is, of course, a distracted secret agent who despite his bizarre claims to the "solved" glamur reminds inspector Clouseau, has a dash of character Mr Bean and somehow reminds the guy who singed one note of the introduction song "Chariots of Fire" at the ceremony of the opening of the London Olympic Games 2012.
His character was also inspired by a passenger and a mysterious world man that Atkinson once played in now already forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard and who is a painting of chaos.
There's one or two hot moments in this latest film edition.
I liked when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medium - century armor and when the propeller hit his helmet for a little while.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems quite uninteresting and unusual, especially now when "serious" film titles such as "007" and "The impossible missions" are offering the elements of comedy themselves.
In my opinion, the freaked events of Johnny English are not so innovative and focused as the Atkinsons are the nomine gegos in the image of Mr. Bean.
The assumption that Great Britain is in serious trouble now has already been a generally accepted fact.
Hacker entered the most secret British spy network and discovered the identity of all British agents, the horrors of an agent on duty, who, unfortunately, a short appearance acts Kevin Eldon.
This poured over the cup of prime patience, a superior and warfare character who experiences a total breakdown of the system because it is politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying to faithfully display the character that should represent Theresu May, but did not get a material to do anything.
Intelligence advisors reveal that all active spys are compromised and therefore they will have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And that person will be unwaverless by Johnny English's head and beard who is currently employed as director of some famous school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are several handsome gegos here because English teaches spying in rocky style.
They quickly bring the English into government rooms to an emergency meeting, where they meet again with Bough, a former partner and their eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an excessively enthusiastic commander of the submarine played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is mostly wasted.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who do everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal wife, Ophelia Bulletko, whom Olga Kurylenko has incorporated.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has a dangerous impact on a carismatic technological billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems, evil Jason Walta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their exciting journey with absurd and funny events: converted into waitress burn the famous French restaurant, cause a huge mess by smuggling on Walta's luxury yacht, and English causes a complete anarchy by trying to use the phones for virtual reality to find out what the inside of the Voltina house looks like.
Everything is done as appropriate for this last continuation, but as much as the film is attractive and embarrassing, it still contains a lot of children’s elements.
Pretty central accomplishment.
And as with other movies about Johnny English, I wondered again, can the British movie industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would match his talent?
The Labour Party denies that she's working four days a week, and they'll be paid in five days.
The Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will consider a radical plan on which the British would work four days a week and be paid for five-day work.
The party apparently wishes that the boss of businesses to the workers provide savings achieved by artificial intelligence revolution (AI) and give them an additional day off.
That would mean that employees would have the right to the three-day weekend with equal salary.
The sources indicate that the idea could be "incorporated" into the party economic programme and plans for the country to be accorded to workers' interests.
The union convention supported switching to a four-day working week as a way that workers benefit from changes in the economy.
The high source from the Laburist Party said to the newspaper "The Sunday Times": "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not be achieved overnight, but represents the aim that fits the approach that this party has to balance the economy for workers, as well as the whole industrial strategy of this party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Laburist Party does not fully accept that desire.
The Laburist Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party does not consider it."
The Shadow Officer, John McDonnell, used the last week conference of the Laburist Party to develop his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to abduct power from the hands of "personal directors" and "professor" in communal companies.
Chancellor's plans in the shadow also mean that current shareholders in watereconomic companies may not be able to recover their entire role because the Labour government could make "prints" based on noticed irregularities.
He also reaffirmed the plans for the inclusion of employees in the company management committees and the creation of inclusive ownership funds in order to give 10 per cent of private companies capital to employees, which would earn annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation about Kavanaugh could change their views.
The FBI investigation on the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week and asked whether the Agency's conclusion could affect the Republican Senators to withdraw their support.
In the interview issued on Sunday, a mailman "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility that the FBI would discover something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Caroline.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said to go to the debate, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after they were sent to you, and asked, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, reliable, unreasonable."
Graham's voice, however, is as if it was in the stone.
"I'm determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh, and it should really be a strong accusation of changing it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett denied everything decisively," Graham added thinking of Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the persons she appointed could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years since.
I don't see anything changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has he achieved anything about poverty reduction?
This Saturday will be a host of the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and equally impressive mission – the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only star performances, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty until 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is the extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international promotion group in hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting actively against it.
To get a free ticket for the event (except if they were not willing to pay VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or “works” such as volunteering, sending emails to the world's leader, telephone calls or any other meaningful way to raise consciousness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen actually been given that he has 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concert a real way to convince people that they require a call for action, or just another case called “clictivism” – where people feel that by signing online petitions or by sending tweets, they really change something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims that he has recorded more than 19 million "acts" of his supporters who have sought to achieve a series of different goals.
It claims that these actions were incentives for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that would lead to a amount of $37 billion that would affect more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group stated 390 obligations and statements resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key obligations include "The Power of Nutrition", the partnership of investors and conductors in the United Kingdom, which is to "help children to develop to their full potential", with a promise that after receipt of more than 4700 Twitters from the world citizens, they will provide $35 million for Rwanda's assistance to end the consumption in this area.
"With the help of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, as you, we can achieve that social injustice of food become only a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, embassy of the "The Power of Nutrition", public at the London concert in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5000 actions taken to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the "The Power of Nutrition" project to ensure food interventions for 5 million women and children.
As an answer to one of the most common questions on your web site, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: “It will be a long and difficult road . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But we will succeed, as well as great movements for civil rights and against the apartheid before us, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weeknda, Shawna Mendesa, Cardi B, Janelle Monae belongs to some of the shows on this year's event in New York that will lead Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Navy as a "bloc" to prevent Russian energy exports Ö Minister of Interior
Washington can, "if necessary", use his navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, discovered by the US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner's week.
Zinke said the Russian engagement in Syria is particularly where it acts on the invitation of the legitimate government . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"I believe that the reason why Russia is in the Middle East is that it wants to sell energy in this area as it does in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said.
But, according to his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States with the navy can ensure the openness of maritime roads and blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event whose host was an unprofit group of Consumer Energy Alliance, represented in the USA as “loss of energy consumers”.
He compared Washington's accesses to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
"Iran and Russia's economic option is more or less exploitation and fuel replacement," he said, and for Russia it is "servicing with the same trick" in economies depending on fossil fuels.
The statements were made simultaneously with the intention of Trump's administration to increase the export of its coated natural gas to Europe, by replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
In that sense, the officials of Trump's administration, including the US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project of Nord Stream 2 (North Stream 2), which, according to Trump, has made Berlin "a prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has emphasized several occasions that Nord Stream 2 gaswater is worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing gaswater capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, a clean economic project.
Kremlj claims that the violent opposition of the Washington project is simply motivated by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of carrying out pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has caused Germany's response that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the German industry Federation (BDI), invited the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state gets involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German industry Federation (BDI), after the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "strictly consider" the possibility of running for President in 2020, Senator Massachusetts
Federal Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "treat" the president's candidacy after the medium-term elections.
During a direct meeting with the Citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about running herself.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which implies a woman's head," she said, transmitting The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will consider seriously the possibility of running for the president."
Warren made an opinion on President Donald Trump during the meeting with citizens, saying "this country leads in the wrong direction."
"I'm terribly worried that Donald Trump is doing our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On the tweet she published on Friday, Warren says: "Of course we need a FBI investigation before we vote."
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think they should be running in 2020.
According to the Centre for Political Research of Suffolk University / Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be running.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support to the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% of votes for potential candidacy and 48% against.
The other highlighted names of the Democrats discussed on the potential race for the President in 2020 are the former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision until January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSP Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin (6) spent a year in Iraq after he signed up in September.
He was also charged with the incident of family violence that happened on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what goes through after his return, is comparable to other families that feel the consequences of PTSP and other wounds with which our soldiers are coming back," said the audience at Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the general problem that she was silent for her son and other war veterans said that "they are returning a little different, returning tight, wondering if she has respect for what their colleagues soldiers and pilots and all other members of the army have given for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and was accused of family violence against a woman, distraction of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholised condition, said Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Police Management of the city of Wasille.
18 federal states and D.C. support new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that reduces asylum to victims fleeing from gangs or domestic violence.
The representatives of 18 federal states and the district filed a friendly report on Friday in Washington in order to support the asylum seeker who disputes policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in the lawsuit of Grace against the sessions which the US Union for Civil Freedoms filed in August against federal policy has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which resulted in a large number of asylum claims in the United States, as countries facing universal problems with gangs and family violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has changed the decision of the Immigration Committee made in 2014 which is to immigrants who have no documents and flee from domestic violence, permitted to file a request for asylum.
The state district attorney of Colombia Karl Racine said in his statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum requirements be resolved on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the lawsuit and that such obstacle is violated by the principle," the court's friend's report states.
Attorneys further argued that the policy that reduces immigrants' entry damages the US economy, arguing that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
The Chief State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered judges for immigration to stop approving asylum to victims fleeing from family violence and gang violence in June.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear for race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political opinion," Sessions said in their policy statement on June 11th.
The purpose of asylum has never been to mitigate all problems even all the serious problems that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Paluo while the number of victims is doubled in the race for the finding of survivors
For survivors, the situation was increasingly difficult.
"The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her boy who was shaking in a fever in the evacuation center in the destroyed city of Paluo.
"The ambulance vehicles bring bodies every minute.
The poor government of pure water."
The inhabitants were seen to return to their destroyed homes, picking through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by 7.5 degrees were crushed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a break in his back and shoulder, rested in front of the Military Hospital in Paluo, where patients were treated openly due to continuous strong late earthquakes.
The tears filled his eyes when he talked about the feeling of a rape earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was depressed within the ruins of the wall," Harris told Associated Press, and added that his family came to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence followed.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" through "propagand ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published four pages of a long ad in the US daily list that promoted the mutual benefits of the US and China trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Peking of the abuse of the American Propaganda Press.
The US President Donald Trump considered on Wednesday a payable supplement of China Daily newspapers in the most selling newspapers in Iowa, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere with the US Congress elections on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Peking is trying to interfere with American elections marked what US officials in the statement for Reuters characterized as a new phase of the Washington escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising for trade promotion, Peking and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that led to high import tariffs.
The revenge of China at the beginning of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, the Chinese and American experts stated.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador in China, and former Governor of Long Years of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said that Peking harmed American workers, farmers and companies.
In the article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China “be doubled this abuse by launching propaganda ads in our own free press”.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the paper kiosk on the streets in Beijing, you will find limited votes of opposition and you will not see any real reflection of the different views that the Chinese people can have on the disturbing Chinese economic path because the media are under strong pressure of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what the newspapers were concerned.
Kavanaugh's debaclosal republicans have removed the voters before the medium-term elections, analysts warn
Since many Republicans are standing with a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and defending him by several indications of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the forthcoming medium-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions that surrounded this event have been very excited, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their vote.
Such things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University of Syracuse, for the article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed suspicion that the last insisting of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI will be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday Ö will not forget it tomorrow and neither in November," Karine Jean-Pierre said on Friday, a higher advisor and a national speaker of the MoveOn Progressive Group, reports the newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestants sang: "The November comes!", protesting in the Senate Chamber while the Republicans who control the Justice Committee were ready to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democrats will be beyond all expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, non-party political analyst.
"People say they're already at a high level, which is true.
But they could be higher, especially among women in suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often don't go to elections."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, which detailed its claims of sexual attack by the Supreme Court candidate, the analysts suggest that there would be a negative response if the Republicans continued to confirm.
"It is a real confusion for the Great Old Party," Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, said NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"It's not only about voting in the committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh was sent to a reservation bench, but also about the way the Republicans approached it and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities Organization, a group that helps to choose democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about whom they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more inclined to him.
The new YouGov survey showed that 41 percent of the subjects were definitely or probably believed in the truth of the testimony of Ford, while 35 percent said that they trusted Kavanaugh safely or probably.
Furthermore, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh believed that he probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same to Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations that Ford made, along with at least one more prosecutor, Debora Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford's witnessed before the Senate's Trial Committee on the oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunk state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitalia at the party during the Yale study in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor plans to run a new Internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company aimed at becoming a competition to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is developing on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the location of their data storage and people who will be allowed to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview for the Fast Company, Berners-Lee was kidding about the intention that was hiding behind the Intrupt "World Domination".
"We must do it now," he thought of startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal network storage" or "pod".
It can contain contact lists, obligation lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that the decision of who can access any information completely of the users.
The company calls it "personal power through data."
The idea for the Intrupt, according to the chief Executive Director of the company John Bruce, is that the company is providing resources, processes and suitable skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a project contract, as well as the community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developing engineers from around the world could make their own decentralized applications with tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether they would make a complete change in which all their business models would turn completely overnight.

In the publication of the media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupta "is a mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect integrity and quality of the new network built on Solida."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortion at the Massachusetts State Institute (MIT).

Bernard Vann: Praises in the depiction of the priests from World War I by Victoria's cross
The celebration in honor of the only priest of the English Church, which was depicted by Victoria's cross as a fighter in the First World War , was approximately in his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had received the greatest British military honour.
The memorial stone discovered two of his grandchildren on the Rushden parade, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “incredibly symbolic ” that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after the attack of his grandfather's confession.
According to the Official Journal of London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the channel of St. Quentin “through a very dense fog and under a strong fire that came from the direction of the battlefield and machinery. ”
Later, he rushed into the first lines and led the army forward with “incredible courage ” before he rushed to the Polish top without help.
Lieutenant Vanna killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s works were “the things I know that I could never achieve, and that motivates humility. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also lay down a vein after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that “he feels very honored to participate in the parade ” and added that“ the courage of the true hero is shown through the support that many will give. ”
Mixed fighting skills fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead got Prastič Peppu
Imagine this Ö stay awake all night to watch the swords Bellator 206 to eventually disable monitoring of the main event.
The program from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in Britain, they were presented live at channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, the British watchers were in shock when the transfer broke down the Prastic Peppa.
Many were not impressed only because of the struggle, they stayed awake until early mornings.
A fan of the breakdown of the transmission by a child drawer on Twitter described as “some kind of sick joke. ”
"In accordance with the state regulation, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to transfer to the child program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for the marketing and communications of Bellator when they asked him about the transfer.
"Yeah, "Free Peppa"."
The President of Bellator, Scott Coker, said he would harmonize his schedules in order to include in the future watchers from Britain.
"When I consider reprising, I think we may be able to fix something," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at six a.m. on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until we have Sunday, when there will be Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were many leaflets that weren't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't.
I can promise you that next time that's not going to happen.
We're going to keep five fights instead of six of what we're doing, and we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've overreacted.
These are unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
The olympic jumper in the water, Tom Daley, says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority compared to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to be successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school, he wasn't aware that "one is not like me."
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disx, leading Lauren Laverne, he said he talks about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also said that winning the Olympic games was less important to him since he became a father.
The regular leader of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, took a few months of rest because of the disease.
When Daley appeared as a wasteman in Laverna’s first show, he said that during his growing up, he felt “being less valuable ” in relation to others because“ it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls. ”
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity against others were real things that gave me power and strength so that I could succeed. ”
He said he wanted to prove that he was “someone and something ” so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The double conqueror of the bronch Olympic Medal has become an excellent person who supports LGBT people and has used his performance at this year's Games of Commonwealtha in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he believes he is happy to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give “the hope to others. ”
The triple world champion said he was surprised by falling in love with a man of American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married a scarf, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said that his age difference was never a problem.
"When you are so young," he looked at his first Olympic Games when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In June, they became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, all the story would be about "I have to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my gold Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in first order," he said.
"I held him for a hand while he was breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally became aware that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I dreamed about all my life to jump in front of the home audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration for the choice of the first song † "Proud" of Heather Small Singing who was reaping in it during the preparation for the Olympic Games and on which she always gets stuck .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast to BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of the form on the bench on Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Rider Cup game, but he'll have to fully revert the form to avoid an unpleasant turn.
Mickelson, who plays the record 12th time in this biennial competition, sent Captain Jim Furyk on the bench in Saturday games with four balls and fours.
Instead of being in the center of action, as he was often for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day in cheering and developing his games on the practicer, hoping to correct what tortures him.
Never the most precise player, even at the top of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for a demanding field of Le Golf National, where a long inequality field routinely punishes unprecise strikes.
And if I'm not scary enough, Mickelson faces a precise British Openscom Molinary in the ninth match on Sunday, who won all four matches this week with Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, get to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he trusted his man more than that and couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slipped me in his back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"There is a lot of confidence."
He's famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I imagined there was more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we should do it.
He wants to be in the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson will overtake Nick Fald's record on the number of Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
That could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, even though Furyk said that his presence brought some inferior values in the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great boy behind it," he explained.
"I think younger players were fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great privilege may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of the Rider Cup can easily be converted into an uncomfortable race.
The Dan debited in Valderrama in 1997, where the team of Captain Seve Ballesteros had an advantage of five points against the Americans, but the game was completed by their victory with a close difference of 141⁄2 .
"You keep reminding us that we had a great advantage in Walderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a close difference," Bjorn said in the picture, after watching the team in 2018, which won the results of 5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
So history will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll play with full power.
Go out to the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floors on the board are released.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and there's a focus on it.
All the time I'm talking, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we're quite aware of who's standing against us the biggest players in the world."
He was delighted at the performance of his players in a heavy golf field, Bjorn added: “I would never run before the rude in this.
Tomorrow you should face a different beast.
Tomorrow are the main individual performances, and it's something completely different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're there as a individual, you're on the final test of your skills of the golf player.
It's a message you have to transmit to players, and she's that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Now leave your companion because he has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the other hand, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with their companions, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those great turns last day, since he was part of the victory team in Brooklyn before he ended as a loser after Europe performed the "master in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered in the question that Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the start of the same thing as what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this turmoil goes in a certain direction, it puts a big pressure on medium swords.
In accordance with this, we organized our position and set up boys like we're going to, you know, try to make magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead an attack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the rest of the Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of boys go in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said about selected players for individual matches.
German New Warship Reloaded to Wait
The latest fregat of the German Navy was to be released in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold wartime, but will not be ready until the next year because of the incorrect systems and cost increases, the local media reported.
The marketing of the “Rheinland-Pfalz” boat, the leadership of a fully new fregat class Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been deferred to the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit reporting a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but concerning problems after delivery affected the fate of an ambitious project.
Four ships of Class Baden-Wuerttemberg, which the Navy ordered in 2007, will replace the old Bremen fregate class.
As far as known, they will have a strong gun, a series of anti-aeroplane and anti-broad missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as radar, infrared and acustical signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods † should be possible to lay down the latest fregates for up to two years without returning to maternal ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the most modern warships that are said to enable Germany to show power abroad † until the time of entering the service will become older, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fregat reached all covers last year, when the German Navy officially refused to let the ship be used and returned to the Blohm & Voss boathouse in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship builder after delivery.
It was a little known about the reasons for return, but the German media indicated numerous key "software and hardware shortcomings" that would make the warship useless if it was sent to a battle mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg will manage the crew of about 120 sailors in half less than the older fregats of Bremen class.
It also proved that the ship is dramatically too heavy that reduces its efficiency and limits the navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that "Rheinland-Pfalz" of 7000 tonnes is double weighted than ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the incorrect hardware, the price of the entire project † including the training of the crew also becomes a problem.
It is said that the price has reached amazing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) in comparison with the starting 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involved in the latest fregates are especially important in the light of recent warnings that the German maritime forces are reducing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defence Committee, admitted that the navy actually "is out of ships capable of schedule."
The official said that the problem had increased in time because the old ships were placed outside the engine and there were no substitute ships.
He expressed regret that none of the fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class can join the Navy.
The National Foundation listens to the secret life of the slipper
New research conducted in the estate in Scotland Highland aims to find out how squirrels use the landscape in the hunting of food.
There is hope that the results will explain the behaviour of these unique flying suckers and help to manage future preservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists in the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will follow the ordinary and swamped patches, as well as brown long-shuffled and river slippers in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key places around the property to monitor the mouse activities throughout the season.
The NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile checks using manual detectors.
The expert analysis of the sounds of all videos will determine the frequency of the vote of the sneakers and what kind it does.
Then a map of accommodation and a report will be made to create a detailed picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Protection Adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the residence are the most important for slippers and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of working on accommodation, such as the creation of leathers and how best to maintain forest surfaces for slippers and other related species.
The population of squirrels in Scotland and around the United Kingdom has significantly decreased during the past century.
They are threatened by building and working on a provision that affects shelter and the loss of accommodation.
Wind turbines and lights can also be a danger, as well as muholders and certain chemical treatments of construction material, and attacks of pet cats.
The slippers aren't really blind.
However, because of their habits of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the harvest.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of the country throughout the country, takes slippers very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, shelter inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only reservation for squirrels in Scotland on the property of Threave in Dumfries and Gallowey, in which eight of the ten types of squirrels live in Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is a perfect area for them.
"There in Threave we have a huge space for slippers," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all good places.
However, there is a lot more that we don't know about the slippers, so the job we do here and on other objects will help us better understand what they need to make progress."
It stresses the importance of verifying the presence of squirrels before starting maintenance work within the buildings, since unintended destruction of one bed can kill up to 400 females and young people, probably destroying the entire local population.
The slippers are protected and illegal to kill them, torture or disturb them or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative of the Scotland Swiss Protection Association, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our sticks and for many of our species we simply don’t know how their population progresses. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape claims while lawyers are ready to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the charges for rape against him as "fake news", saying that people "will promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published these charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently then he paid her $375,000 to shut up about the incident, he reported on Friday, Der Spiegel.
In a live video he set on Instagram for his 142 million followers a few hours after the complaint, Ronaldo 33, he criticized allegations as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," says the five-fold conquer of the Golden Ball in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," adds a football player with a smile.
Ronald's attorneys are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the indications they called "unappropriate reporting of doubts in the area of privacy", says Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the football player would seek a compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the weight of the offence, which is probably one of the most severe injuries of personal rights in the past few years".
It is stated that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a hotel apartment and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After a Night Club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorg reportedly returned to the football room, where he allegedly raped her analytically, the documents submitted in the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent" was a "good boy" whom that "one percent" had failed.
The papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had a sexual relationship, but that he was treated.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and photographed her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was "fearful of revenge" and was worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
Thirty-four-year-old girl says she wants to cancel the settlement because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the edge of the crossing to Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to the Italian giant Juve as part of a transfer valued 100m euros.
Brexit: UK will "regret forever" for losing car manufacturers
The UK will "regret forever" if after Brexit loses the status of the world leader in car production, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "embarrassing" that Toyota UK told BBC that, in case Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnastone, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that waiting on borders in the case of Brexita without agreement could cause loss of jobs.
The Burnaston engine that produces Toyota Auris and Avensis has produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that, if Britain leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, we will experience the stake of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director-General of Toyote in Burnastone.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreements due to possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that he will close his mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer refers to the risks in the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement reached.
Toyotina's production line works according to the principle "right in time", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers to the UK and the EU for cars working on orders.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there might be a breakdown on the border that the industry says it could lead to delay and lack of parts.
Toyota in its factory in Derbyshire could not hold more supplies than those needed for one day, they said from that company, so the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that the Chequers plan offering Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks on the border".
"We need to agree. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain current success but also to use this opportunity," BBC Radio 4 told today.
"The evidence not only of Toyote but also of other producers shows that we must absolutely be able to continue this very successful series of supply chains."
In Toyota, they could not tell how long the production could be stopped, but they warned that long-termly, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually result in loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnastone for 24 years and who is a member of the Union union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, after your jobs go away, they never return. ”
The government spokesman says: "We have made a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein could "was deferred in another week" as a bid for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.
Rosenstein monitors the work of a special lawyer Robert Mueller, investigating Russia's involvement in elections, the links between Trump's associates and Russia and the eventual distraction of justice by the president.
The question is if Trump will fire the Deputy State Attorney, and that would endanger Mueller's independence, he has been exposing rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wire wearing to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refused these statements.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of the announcement that he would just resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he would not like to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a breakdown by hearing the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation of the FBI against Kavanaugh's lawsuits, which further deferred a lot of Senate votes.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News on Sunday.
On questions about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not defined, it could be this week; and it could be delayed for another week taking into account all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to tell the press about everything."
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
Chief Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not the result of the defence of the "theater behaviour" of television reporters, even though she said: "I will not oppose the fact that they're swallowing up."
Then she emphasized that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President organizes more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," she said, adding without any indication of evidence: "We have analysed numbers."
Short talks will continue to happen, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to ask the question directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are often trying to enable this, and you could see it in the last few weeks, and just that you can talk to the President of the United States will replace short talks to the press."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of gathered journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU employees in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland due to the fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to the EU staff employed in Scotland NHS to express its gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter in short of six months before the UK withdrawal was withdrawn from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed to undermine the costs of submitting requests for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal have continued, which are moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the government of the United Kingdom also strengthens preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So now I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the whole EU, as well as broader, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and help patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie subjected to an emergency operation after head injury
The Linean Team of Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in the Saturday defeat from the Vanderbilt Commodores Club with the result of 31 Ö 27, reports Mike Organ from Tennessean.
The Chief Coach of Tennessee, Rod Reed, told the press that the injury happened just before half-time.
"He came to the playground line and just crashed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the ground before they put it on the weapons and sent him to further searches.
The representative of the State University of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie quit the surgery in Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there were no "details of type/scope of injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third year student with two years of toy stake, plays the first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five bullets before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 bullets in the season.
Foreign customers will be charged with a higher fee for buying real estate in the United Kingdom
According to the new conservative plans, foreign customers will be charged with a higher fee for buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless
That step will neutralize the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
Increased fees will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The treasure expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year for helping homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign customers will be charged with higher fees to buy real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless.
This move will be recognized as an attempt to neutralize Jeremi Corby's efforts to attract young voters to promise that they will provide more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with high salaries.
Increased fees will be charged from individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will contribute to government efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee collected to the current fee, including an increase which was introduced to other homes and property purchased for issuement may be up to three per cent.
The treasure expects this move to be collected by 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the newly built real estate in London buy people who have no residence in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first real estate to participate in the company of those who have their own home.
Many wealthy areas in the country are especially in the capital of the city of the ghosts because of a large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy followed only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction of fees to help a larger number of young people reach their first home.
He accused large construction companies to maintain high prices of real estate by taking, but not by exploiting the country, and urged Mrs. May to give up quotas to valuable estate in order to repair "happiness for the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and ending with no embodied delocations.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Later last year I said that I would devote my mandate to renew the British dream that life of every new generation should be better.
And that means fixing our ruined apartment market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build life.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with abroad accommodation, can buy homes as well as worthy British.
The dream of having a home has become too far, and the shame of homelessness is still real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
The chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "endish ambition" was one day to become the manager of Scotland.
Scotch (42) enjoys the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which currently takes the third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Lights after St. Mirren was reopened at the Scotland football championship last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and that always dragged me back.
But that opportunity could still be achieved only if I had been successful in the club management."
Ross' precedents at the head of Sunderland, include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cania.
Former head of Alloa Athletica says he didn't feel fear because he inherited so famous names in such a big club, after he previously refused calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me will now be measured to whether I will be able to return this club back to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club back there."
Ross only completes the third year of his governing career, after the period during which he was the assistant chief in Dumbarton and 15-month experience as part of Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the fall to the winner of the championships of the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a real crossroad," he recalled taking Alloe.
"I really believed that managing is more than just playing.
It sounds unusual because I worked well, earned solidly and enjoyed quite successful moments.
But the game can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to do every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and job pressure, but management seems to be the right thing.
I've always wanted to manage, and that's what I'm doing, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever felt in my life."

Perfect time for pintu is on Saturday 17:30, as the research shows
The summer heat wave has increased income to British pubs that have suffered from finances, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data show that pubs and bars have achieved an increase in income in July by 2.7 per cent, but the restaurant income decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the Business Advisory Office of the Chief Business Controller, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the nice time and participation of England at the World Championship that lasted longer than it was expected, meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when the revenues of pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, with the rest of the restaurants now even more affected.
The fall of 1.8% in the revenues of restaurants in June just deteriorated in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly used have achieved much greater profits under equal conditions compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
The pubs where food is mostly used also suffered from the heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In controlled beaches and selling bars, the drinks increased by 6.6% during the month, and the sale of food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, RSM analyst for vacation and hospitality, said: "This results continue the trend we see since April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events continue to be the biggest factors when it comes to sale on the external market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight difficulties, although 4.8% of sales drops at the annual level will be particularly painful because of constant cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not come up in a worse time for the leaders of the places where food is used, and the time will show whether the moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will give over the necessary rest."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowing of trademark shares.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales system for the British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses data on the efficiency of 47 operational groups, with a total traffic of over 9 billion pounds, and an industrial reference value has been established.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents
Research reveals that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers
Testing 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages
The news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had the main account that showed to their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey covering 20,000 students of high schools showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" accounts Ö references to the web site for sharing photos.
The news has increased the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students stated that they use a clear "main" account for showing to their parents, while they have private accounts.
One mother who met the secret web site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to say "force me."
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40% of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, of which half acknowledged that they own private accounts.
The chief of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It is anxious that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be an athletic voice in the Scotland Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scotland Athletic Committee as an inexecutive director at the annual management congregation.
Doyle is the most excellent Scottish athletic, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those who have sports to use its broad experience gained at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys great respect in the Scotland, British and world athletic community and we are sure that the sports athletic in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to be a voice of sportsman, and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland. ”
The American, who won a 200 and 400 meters race in the games in Atlanta in 1996, from his total four Olympic gold, and now he is a regular expert of the BBC, after the past ischemic attack, no longer able to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a brain attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show if I'm going to recover and how much.
It was hard, but he was completely recovered, he learned to walk again, and today for the exercise of agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Shared opinions on the Internet on advertising for a traitor comparing mothers with cows
The company for the production of traitors by its advertising that mothers breastfeeding their children compares with cows that the muse has moved to share opinions on the Internet.
In order to mark the launching of the product that is claimed to be “first silent traitor in the world”, Elvie’s company for consumer technology published the advertising inspired by the ironical music video to show the freedom the new traitor gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a store full of seed and cows with music, which says: "Yes, I am, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this is not my breast."
Then follows the refren: "Pump, pump, feed the baby with it, pump, pump, pump, the muse of your ladies."
However, the advertising, published on the Facebook website of the company, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video record has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it lights "the horribles" of the milk industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and born to produce milk, except to steal their children a few days after birth," one person wrote.
Elvie's traitor is discreetly fitted into the breast bracelet (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: “The mother and child are reasonablely traumatic.
But yes, why don't you use them to advertise traitors for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Somebody added: "All the free ads."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman confessed that her song was "surprising".
"I think this is a genius idea.
If I had more breasts, I'd buy one.
Purchase of milk made me feel like a cow.
The ads are a little crazy, but I figured it out as it is.
This is a genius product," she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun advertisement focused on mothers who issue milk (often at their jobs or toilets) and feel like ‘ cow. ’
This is not a commercial that praises or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they were dancing all with discreet traitors placed in the bracelets.
The concept of the campaign is based on knowing that many women who betray milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie's traitor, however, is completely silent, no wire or pipes and fits discreetly into the breast breast, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even exit during the tradition.
Anne Balarin, a partner and an executive creative director of Mother commented: "The traitor of Elvie is so revolutionary that deserves brave and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to place in the center of attention the tradition and all its challenges, while at the same time in a fun and understandable way to demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom that a new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time the traitor Elvie got on the covers.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for designer Marta Jacobovski while she used the product.
Thousands of children migrants quietly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made the accommodation of children under the sponsor's care.
Traditionally, most sponsors were themselves immigrants without documents and feared to endanger their own residue in the country by drawing up and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household will have to give fingerprints and that data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official for immigration and customs, testified before the convention that the agency arrested dozens of people who signed up for sponsoring minors without escort.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had not been recorded in criminal records.
"At least 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of the country's household are illegal, and most of them are criminal strangers.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to shelter workers, with a view to rapidly implementing the child proceedings, officials have introduced new rules that will require from some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, which was earlier the standard.
Many will appear by means of a video conference call, not personally, in order to present their case before the immigration court.
Those who do not satisfy the aid criteria will be deported quickly.
According to the asylum workers and reports that have appeared from the system of the past months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent explosions or escape attempts.
The defenders said these concerns were expressed in larger objects such as Tornillo, where, due to his size, it is very likely that the signs of the child's torment will be overlooked.
They added that moving children into a tent city without enough time to be emotionally prepared or to say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma with which many children are already fighting.
Syria orders American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In turning to the UN Main Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has been going on for eight years.
Moulem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were in the Syrian soil illegally, under the excuse of fighting terrorism, and that "will be treated accordingly with them".
"They must withdraw immediately and without condition," he told the congregation.
Moulem insisted on "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, while millions have lost their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "the fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories clean" from terrorist groups and "whichever illegal presence of strangers".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mostly train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in the field in a war-destroyed country.
As for refugees, Moulem said that the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "proliferation of irrational fears" that motivated refugees not to return.
"We invited the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate those returns," he said.
"They politicize what should be a pure humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help renew Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the war ending opposition.
UN diplomas say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a zone of tampon in the latest major rebel rebellion Idliba is an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented the mass attack of Syrian forces with Russia's support to a province in which three million people live.
Moulem, however, emphasized that the agreement had "jassy deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action would be focused on the dżihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front associated with Al-Kaida, "to be eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon he will convene the first meetings of the new committee composed by government members and opposition to compose the post-war constitution for Syria and open the road for elections.
Moulem set the terms for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the commission should be limited "to the revision of articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
In this logic, Mr. Trump should win the re-elections of 2020 unless many liberal viewers probably hope, revocation and scandal end his presidency too early.
What would no doubt be "the dramatic finals of the presidentship ever!"
There are no signs of audience's tired right now.
Since 2014, the spectrum in the struggle term has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nelsen, Fox News has average 2.4 million audiences in the struck term, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" exceeded the visuality of up to 3.5 million viewers in the nights of broadcasting main news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer's producer of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" said about the government secretary who becomes president after the attack destroying Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of the comedy and author of the book Just the funny parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking In the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers the taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her she'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He answered, "Because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovelle told me.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories that come from Washington can define the future of the abortion of Roa against Wade, can the immigrant families be reunited as well as the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, you're overcome the level of the informed citizen when you catch that you're watching a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of the "deep background" for his book "Fear", on Paul Manafort's jacket of skin worth $15,000 (the clothing item full of fagility," says Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, anatomies of Mr. Trump, which Mr. Stormy Daniels gives.
I, for example, Super Maria will never look at the same eyes again.
"The part of what he makes you experience it as a reality show is that you are feeded by something every evening," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the producer of the "Puggage", on the rotating acting set and everyday plays of Trump's show (boring with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss any episode because you're going to be behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the north coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunned with 80 degrees temperature (about 27 °C), but he was inside and watching MSNBC and filming CNN at the same time.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Court of Justice, and the future of the Supreme Court hanged at the end.
"I remember when we used to do all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money is left to the most uncertain medium-term election race for the Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania district experiences a flood of money, thanks to the restructuring of the congress districts, resulting from two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently restructured district of Pittsburgh's pregrading part explicitly highlights Democrat Conor Lamba who won a seat in the second district last spring at special elections.
Lamb competes against another current representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who presents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely complied with the new 17th district.
The tickets were reprinted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old circuits were unconstitutionally designed for the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has launched a fight to finance the campaign between the main parties' funding collectors, the Committee collecting funds for the democratic campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in widely monitored special March elections for the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania.
That position was held by the Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won a 20-point district.
Political analysts have given little advantage to democrats.
The United States is important whether they should be punished by El Salvador for providing support to China and then retreat.
The diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a small resistance of Washington.
Mr Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel from Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump's management team.
State Department officials decided to invite US diplomatic missions heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "new decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore", spokesman Heather Nauert said.
However, the penalties were considered only against El Salvador, who received estimated $140 million of US aid in 2017 for, inter alia, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Mediterranean country and high unemployment rates and murders.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue to a similar gathering last year, which was considered a progress in efforts to prevent migrant movement towards the United States.
By the mid-September, however, the high administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to be held and actually ceased any consideration of the penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for the mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration administers the meeting, diplomats said.
And three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
Chairman of the White House on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal debates under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports have been confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next thing that is preparing could be the report of a special investigator Robert Mueller on the possible Trump obstruction of justice, which is now very significant publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller has reportedly also focused his investigation on whether Mr Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of its attack on our elections.
If the majority changes in the Congress, Mr Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he is preparing to stand before the voters again, or perhaps at the end of the jury of him equals.
There's a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that the inevitable fall of Mr Truma -- nor those like him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, the German officers were willing to strike the state against Hitler, just that the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia in München.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter.
The history turns around such points of inflation, and the unpleasant democracy march is accelerating or late.
The Americans are facing a few of these influx points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that he secretly suggested the filming of the president last year and speculated his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the recently ordered FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite the convincing accusations of sexual attack and unfair testimony?"
And above all, shall we vote at the mid-term elections for the Congress that Mr Trump will invite to responsibility?
If we fall on those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we're not going to fall for the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia whom he deported to Auschwitz was the same Nazi regime that he once stood in my Ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to burn candles for Sabbath on that table with a cooked cross.
With such heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
On Thursday, the Rapid host of Vienna, knowing that the victory of the Austrians, after the impressive remiss in Spain against Villarrel at the beginning of this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from showing up for the first time in the season to the remnant of 2 Ö 2 with Villarreal, but believes that the Rangers can use this result as an exhaustive board for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," a 31-year-old boy said.
"We entered the game, believeing that we can achieve something and pulled out a score.
Maybe we could finally steal the game, but, generally, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the other.
There's another big European night on Thursday.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it'll be a hard game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the cheerleader, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year, it was definitely difficult, among all that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now it has a good feeling.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy; training is good.
Let's hope we can now continue, leave the past season behind us and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the research participants had a clear idea of what they wanted to care, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the Nationwide researchers said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they were talking about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nationwide life insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your desires in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to take care, because these choices can be a significant factor in the cost determination.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay those costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care can include traditional insurance for long-term care, hybrid life insurance policy with a cash value that will help you cover these costs or self-sustainment with your own wealth.
Fix your legal documents: Prevent legal battles in the root.
In order to identify a trusted person who will supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Also consider giving power to manage your finances.
You want to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your accounts if you are not able to do so.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your older parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Specify the details in the written plan to be prepared.
"It's not only about finances, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan on your hand."
A man shot several times from the air rifle in Ilfracombe
Man's been shot several times from the air rifle while he was coming home after his night exit.
The victim, in his 40s, was located in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The cops described the shooting, which happened about 2:30 BST, as a random act.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not dangerous for life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials reported, and the number of people were expected to rise.
Since communications were terminated, the aid officers could not get any information from the Donghala province, areas northern from Palua, closer to the epicentre of quakes of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Paluo after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donghala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the west coast of Sulawesia, with a estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit him.
Donggala is a district that stretches over 300 miles of the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The district, the administrative region lower than the province, was estimated from 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the province of Sulawesa, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nicle mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Moralia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunami several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit Western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis last years:
2004: The large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian Province Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most inhabited island in Indonesia, which caused tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of 7.6 degrees hit the town of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of 7,5 degrees hit one of the Mentawai island near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A filthy earthquake affected the region of Pidi Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because he reminded people of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the fall of buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes have been hit by the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people died, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for family violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and the candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for the charge of the attack.
Palin, 29, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of family violence, disturbance of family violence and resistance of arrest, the report published on Saturday by an Alaska State Officer.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in custody of Mat-Su and is retained on an unsustained $500 bond, CTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said "Innocent, of course," the network reported on the question of the statement of guilt.
Palina is charged with three class-A breaches, which means he could be in jail up to a year and be punished with a $250,000 penalty.
He was also accused of a breach of class B, punishing one day of prison and a penalty of $2,000.
It's not the first time that a criminal application has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with an attack on his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is right before the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of family violence, disturbance of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholised condition associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin criticised the veteran groups in 2016 after connecting her son's violent behaviour with PTSP after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake hit by the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 degrees caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric energy networks and communications have been terminated, and in the next days the number of victims is expected to rise.
The earthquake hit the immediate nearby of the central Sulawesi, north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Societal networks are circling videos that show the moment of a hit.
There were hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Paluo when tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a suspect for terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people have died in a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a truck to rent home Depot to attack the bicycle trail along the West Side road in the lower Manhattan, where he coated the pedestrians and bicycles that were found on his way in October
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a severe physical injury, according to the notification of the intention to seek a death penalty that was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to the eventual death penalty, in accordance with the judicial document.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal major jury of Saipov hit a 22-point charge, which included eight charges for murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in the cases of organised crime, and the charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "relevant planning and prediction," the prosecutors said, describeing the way Saipov conducted it as "a gross, cruel and corrupt".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diega Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diega Mendoze and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccca," said the intention notification.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern County of New York last tried a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but eventually sentenced to life prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a federal case in New York in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after they were convicted to spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 1953.
According to the judicial documents, Saipov, born from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in days and months after the attack.
He said to investigators that he was feeling good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that, after watching the video of ISIS on his phone, he was inspired to commit an attack, the accusation said.
He also asked for an ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police reported.
He said he wasn't guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "approximately disappointed" in the decision of the plaintiff.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty rather than accepting the confession of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only extend the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the plaintiff not to seek death penalty.
Parliament Conservative Member says NIGEL FRAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the People's Army" during the protest at the Conservative Conference.
Former head of the United Kingdom Independence Party said that politicians had to "feel" pressure" of the eurosceptics since one of the members of the Parliament of Theresa May suggested that it should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative representative Peter Bone said to the Birmingham processor that the United Kingdom would have "exited" so far if Mr. Farage was a secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge to which Mrs. May was faced in reconciliation of her deeply divided orders emphasizes the Toryevs of the residue joining a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister endeavours to maintain its compromise plan "Chequers" in the middle of the attack of the beneficiaries of Brexita, supports the remainder and the EU.
Allies insisted that it would continue to try to make a deal with Bruxelles despite the reaction and force euro skeptics and labourists to choose between its package and the cocos.
Mr. Bone said at the "Leave Means Leave" campaign in Solihull that he wanted to "flick Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have received the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd have been out by now," he said.
Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
Speaking of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subjected.
We want to bring our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to remain completely incorrect."
Conservative girl and supporter Brexita Andrea Jenkyns was also in procession, addressing the press words: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the wider public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually and were those who went out to the streets and chose us.
Please dismiss Chequers and start listening."
In a highlighted message, Mrs. May added: “The premises keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises. ”
Farage said to the gathered that politicians must force themselves to "feel pressure" if they are about to fail the decision made at the referendum in 2016.
"There is a matter of trust between us and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to say 'it won't pass you'."
In the message of an excited audience, he added: “I want our political class, on the edge of Brexita, to feel pressure.
We're mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us a victory in Brexit and we're not gonna calm down until we become an independent, self-governmental, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the remnants marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
A bunch of activists waved the transparency "Torievci versus Brexit" after launching the group this weekend.
The Labourist Lord Adonis laughed at conservatives for the security problems they suffered from the application of the party during the opening of the conference.
"They are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the Canadian Plus plan, for the unrestrained state on borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take serious considerations to run for the president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she'll "use serious consideration of running for president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that a democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday in direct association with citizens in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent criticist of President Donald Trump, is running to reelect in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was a co-Chairman of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There's been a long time in the center of speculation to resist Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took over his duty.
The participant asked her if she was planning to run for the president.
Warren answered that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means a woman's head."
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims.
Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she arrested a suspect in the shooting with the death exit of the National University of Louisiana (LSU) Wayde Sims who took place on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police published information on the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at the ET press conference.
On Friday, they published a murder recording, asking for help in identifying a man from the video.
Sims, 20, was killed early Friday near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet in the head injury and eventually died as a result of it," Murphy J. Paul told the media chief on Saturday, on 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed that he was at the crime scene and possessed a weapon and that he killed Wayde Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken to custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a third year student of 198 cm who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in 10 first seasons and average 17.4 minutes and reached 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps on the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the order guarantees his victory on Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order "will play a great role in the race".
From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Wettel first went to the box and left Hamilton on the start, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered a circle later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the wheel wheel action which caused Ferrari's driver unwilling to leave the free inside in danger of delay after a double move in the defense of the third curve.
Max Verstappen started from the last row and was seventh to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he led a large part of the race while he lifted his tires to reach a quick ending and overrun Kimie Raickonen for the fourth place.
Finally, he arrived in boxing in the 44th circle, but he failed to accelerate his rate in the remaining eight circles while Raickonen took the fourth place.
The day was hard because Walteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a gentleman who let me go.
The team has done a really extraordinary job to achieve a formational finalist," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body speech.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein's meeting on Saturday for her insistence that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In addressing the meeting in Western Virginia, the president did not directly deal with the testimony of Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "los and ugly and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and wicked, nasty and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks in public, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you released the information?
Remember her answer... have you released a document in public?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added by imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein sent a letter in July with details on Ford's instructions against Kavanaugh, and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein demanted that the information came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't let her story public," Feinstein told the committee, reporting The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her secret, and I kept her secret, which she asked."
However, her denial did not encounter the approval of the president, who commented on the meeting on Saturday night: "To tell you something - it was a very bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body speech in my life."
Continuing its defense of candidate for the Supreme Court, which three women have accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that the democrats use these accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return their power at any price.
You see evil, nasty, they don't care who they're going to hurt, whom they have to cross in order to get to power and control," the words of the president are, mediate transmitted.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 † 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has reached two naked for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars redeemed themselves for the defeat of Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday victory in Dundee on Saturday with 5 Ö 3.
The giants in early minutes have reached the advantage of two naked hits of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought homework to equation, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back.
Francois Bouchard equipped Dundee before two naked Lucas Lundvald Nelsen secured the victory.
It was the third defeat in the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's team, who came from the background and defeated Dundee with the result of 2 Ö 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season of two teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening of the game arrived in the fourth minute, precisely at 3:35, the assistant of Kendal McFaul, with David Rutherford's help to double the leadership by Beauvilleer four minutes later.
In the rapid opening of the game, Sullivan's home team returned to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with the leadership when he gave his second naked that night at the end of the first third.
The homemen regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to equation in the dosing of naked forces at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nelsen for the first leadership of Dundee at the end of the second third, and he took care of the victory when his team was halfway to win the last third of the game.
Giants, who lost four of the last five games, are hosts of Milton Keynes teams in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers in the aircraft avoid earthquake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared hero after he died while he secured the safe flight of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many have disappeared after a great earthquake that hit the Sulawesi island on Friday and caused tsunamis.
The strong earthquakes continue to affect the area, and many are trapped in ruins in Paluu.
However, despite his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job in the Mutiara Airport Control Tower, Sis Al Juffrey, who was swimming strongly.
He remained to ensure the safe flight of Batik Air on flight number 6321, which was then on the track.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was going down.
He died at the hospital later.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman of Air Navigation Inndonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balicpapan in Kallimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Paluo.
"Our heart is broken for that," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that thousands of people could reach the number of deaths, and the state disaster mitigation agency says that access is limited to the towns of Donggali, Sigiu and Boutongu.
"The number of deaths is believed to continue to rise, since many bodies are still under ruins, and many could not even come," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the agency.
The waves that reached the height and up to six meters destroyed the Pala where mass funeral would be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “The vehicles of ambulance bring bodies every minute.
The government's poor clean water.
Little stores are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is chasing to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday in Palo and said to the country's army: "I beg you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" Reports CNN.
Indonésia was affected by earthquakes in Lomboc earlier this year, with more than 550 people killed.
Air Niugini now says that one man is being run missing after a plane accident in the laguna
The airline company owned by the aircraft that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is running as missing, after it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the drowning aircraft.
In his statement, Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon I can't track one of the passengers.
The airline company reported that they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in attempts to find a person concerned.
The airline did not respond immediately to the requirements for additional information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the rest of the passengers and the crew after the plane fell into the water while he was trying to land at the airport of the island Chuuk.
The officials said on Friday that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline company reported that six passengers were held in the hospital on Saturday, and that they were all stable.
What caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline company and the American Navy stated that the plane landed in the lagoon near the road.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the road.
Bill Jaynes, a traveller from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to break through the water that came to the elevator to the exit in the case of the danger of the aircraft that drowned.
He said the stewardess was panicking and screaming, and he suffered a smaller head injury.
The American Navy stated that the navy who worked nearby to repair the ports also helped to rescue by using a boat to surveillance people to land before the aircraft drowned in about 30 meters of water.
Air Safety Network indicates that in the accidents of air carriers registered in PNG in the last two decades, 111 people died, but none of them were involved in Air Niugini.
The analyst presents a time review of the night where the woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded a case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used the phone data to compose a puzzle about the movement of a 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got the location information with a few cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers' night when she was killed, which was contrary to his previous claims, transmitted by the Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin when he was with his own claims with a friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis, a certain time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls and contact information from the phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
Defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.

Artists like Fugees and Common are reborn in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?
New York Nanny sued a couple for cancellation after a "racist" message
The nanny from New York sued a couple for discriminatory cancellation after she received a wrong-directed message from a mother called it "one more black girl".
The couple denys that they are racists, comparing the charge with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed displeasure when, at her arrival of the first working day in 2016, she learned that the new nanny of her children, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
"NEEE JOŠ ONE CRNKY," Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in her wife's message.
However, instead of sending her to her wife, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After she understood her mistake, Mrs Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "uncomfortable" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice because, as she claims, their former nanny, who was the African woman, was badly doing her job, and she was expecting Philippine instead, transmitted by New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice got a payoff for one day of work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a pair for a dismissal and asks for $350 per day for a six-month period for which it was originally hired, although without contracts.
"I want to show them that they can't do such things," she said to Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to claim that they were racists, saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was reasonable to be done, due to fear that her insult would not be able to trust later.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent in her message.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you trust your children to the person you were indecent, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said that his wife received only two months of birth leave after birth of a child and that she was in “very difficult situation. ”
"You will sue someone who is in such a situation
"That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still in progress, the public opinion court quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that the readers would not match the bear speaking, revealed in a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says: “It is hard to get into the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time.
It's very fun what we now know about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as BBC's recorder before a little slippery bear inspired him to write a child's book, was optimistic if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as “a very important family member, ” she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite quiet and wasn't a praiseman," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, everything has been experienced as a achievement of your own child: you are proud of him, although nothing of it really is your work.
I think Paddington's success was watching it that way.
Although it was about his work and his imagination, he always had credits only to Paddington."
My daughter died and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was urgently transported to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nica, where doctors tried to save her life for nothing.
"Nad regularly called to say it's really bad and they believe it won't get away," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The medicines given her doctors to maintain the heartwork slowly lost effect and left her body system.
She died just before she boarded, and then everything turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what's going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything in me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already sad about her daughter's loss, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers -- who were not aware of the temptations she was passing through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and my tears were all the time leaning down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a strong feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Woman's messages in grief on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones for suicide are working on preventing others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on the Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at his age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, living in Lydney, said her son was a cook with an infectious smile that she was waiting for a brilliant career.
"Everyone remembered him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
However, before his death, he left his job because he was in “really dark condition. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found a brother after you took her life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I am constantly worried that this will have a negative effect. ”
Mrs. Davis came to the idea with cards “to make people know that there is someone you can go and talk, even if he is a friend.
Don't sit in silence you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-year-old friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behaviour.
On Christmas, he was on the bottom of the day when the children opened gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes or he wanted anything else."
She said that his death was a great trauma, but that they had to overcome it: “All this leaves a great mess in the family.
He's kicking us.
But we will continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on the end while the FBI starts the investigation.
"I thought maybe we could introduce a little unity if we were really able to get something like the time and range of limited investigation," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee "depleted" was in the middle of the incorporated party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republicans want the FBI investigation?
Their disadvantage is motivated by the choice of a moment.
The medium-term elections only arrived in five weeks, on 6 November † if, as is expected, the Republicans do not go well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to lead the desired man to a election for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly calls the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and over him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the feds make their report?
They will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's still not clear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break with a decisive voice and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of escapes from North Korea under Kim's leadership
The number of escapes from North to South Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korean legislator said.
Calling on the data of the United South Alliance Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1127 escapes last year compared to 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors are stricter control on the border crossing between North Korea and China and the more fees that smugglers charge to people.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
A large majority of northern escapes eventually received South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross it than a strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers refugees illegal migrants, not refugees, and often violently returns them.

Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang on talks focused on the permanent denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when in a broader sense they agreed to work on the release of the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed US sanctions that they had not made any progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and it does not come to mind that we first disarm ourselves under such circumstances," Mr. Ri said in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court
The opposition leader, Nancy Pelosi, called a candidate for Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court "hysterical" and said he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented on the Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't have thought that if a woman ever acted like that, they would call her "hysterical", Pelosi described her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Board on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally demanted claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the introduction statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "grothestic and coordinated blackmails" organised by the liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the work of the Supreme Court, because he showed that he had prejudice against democrats.
"I think he discvalifies himself with such statements and the way it attacks Mrs Clinton and Democrats," she said.
On the question of whether he will try to undo Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if democrats get the majority in the Deputy House, Pelosi retreated.
"I will tell the next Ö if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not capable not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court on which he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in Colombia County.
Pelosi added that as a democrat is concerned about the potential Kavanaugh's decisions against the Law of Accessible Care or the Law on the Abbreviation of the Roe v. Wade Procedure, because it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh overlooked questions about whether he would change some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical, side person to go to court and expects us to say, ‘Isn't it wonderful,’ Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.

"We cry when we get angry," Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She continued: “A woman who used to be an executive director, who told me how she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that, when she was angry and crying, the person with whom she said, ‘ You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
The tears are allowed as a way out of anger, partly because they're basically misconcepted.
One of my most clear memories from one of the first jobs, in the office in which men dominated, is how once I cried about an inexplicit anger, one older woman .. a cold manager who always feared a little .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be pleased because they'll think they're hitting you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at his presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an outdoor affair on Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for the president.
"It was not a well-designed decision," she told me through the laughing 30 years later.
"The seven candidates were already in the race, and they certainly didn't need one more.
Someone called them Snow and seven dwarfs.
Since the campaign was already out, it was delayed with the collection of funds, and she pledged that she would not enter the race unless she gathered two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of the supporters, who gave her $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
While she was saying that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so obsessed with emotions to people who supported her, frustrating the system that made the collection of money harder and the aim of the voters instead of the delegates, and the anger of sexism to squeeze her throat.
"You would think I had experienced a nervous breakthrough," Mrs. Schroeder recalled the media's response to it.
"You'd think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they're gonna put on my grave monument.
"She cried."
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The beginning of the trade war between the United States and China has remarked loudly and, while the battle is far from the end, the distinction between countries can be of use to Beijing in a long-term period, the experts say.
Donald Trump, US President, fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation in this week appeared with new customs products that affected $200 billion (150 billion), in fact taxing half of all the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing returned every time in some way, and the customs of five to ten percent was recently introduced to $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised that the United States will respond with a hit, and the second largest world economy will certainly not be surrendered soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by resigning demands, but public submission to the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Peking plays his cards well, pressures of the US trade war can provide long-term positive support to China by reducing mutual dependency of two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Peking could create conditions for the launch of economic stress in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a scientific associate for strategic thinking focused on Asia at the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, said Foreign Minister
Syria says she is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals for assistance in the renewal of the country destroyed by a war that lasts over seven years.
In addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the field is stable and safer, thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks to establish a normal situation.
All the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures focused on their daily life and existence are now satisfied.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Six million people still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would be welcome to help renew the devastated country.
However, he emphasized that he would not accept parole aid or aid from countries who sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, defeating the US team with the final result of 16,5 Ö 10,5 in the Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
Until now, the United States has lost six times in the European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe reconquered the crown while the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn team reached 14,5 points to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was tortured almost during the whole tournament, on the 16th hole, a couple of three, sent a ball into the water at the first stroke, leaving Francescu Molinario's match.
Italian golf Molinari brightened in all rounds and became one of the four players who had ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament started this format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth expelled Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranking player of the European team, with 5–4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 of the English Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of eight Ryder purchases, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became a European with the highest victory on the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't stop my tears today.
It was a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that I've won a buy again.
It's all about the team. I'm happy I could help," Garcia said, full of emotions after the European victory.
He transmits the torch to his co-national John Ram, who won a legendary American golf player on Sunday, Tiger Woods, with a result of 2&1.
"I feel incredible pride because of the victory of Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics of one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 main titles, and is right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find a way out, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a top golf during the whole tournament.
After his team was disappointed, US Captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of these guys, they fought. ”
In certain moments, we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna get over it, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our board of Ryder Cups, so we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off the hat of people.
We're overwhelmed."
