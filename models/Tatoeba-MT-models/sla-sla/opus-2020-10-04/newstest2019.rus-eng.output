Elon Mask was forced to leave the chairman of the Tesla Council
The United States Price Papers and Markets Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilon Mask resolved their debate on fraud.
The CNBC News reported this.
According to the television channel, in the framework of the arrangements, Mask will have to leave the head of the Tesla Council.

The money will be allocated to the injured investors.

Elon Mask is an American entrepreneur of the 50 richest people of the Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the SpaceX SpaceX space corporation, the Neuralink Neuralink Neuralink, and the developer of Tesla's electric corporation, as well as the contributor of Paypal.
The United States Price Papers and Markets Commission beforewards courted the Director-General of Tesla Ilona Mask due to his communication published in Twitter on the possible purchase of the company.
Last month, Mask announced plans to make Tesla a private company and to buy all shares on the market at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the share in $420 was apparently set “because of the importance of this number in the marihuana culture”, the Bloomberg previously reported with a reference to the director of the Security Division of the Commission, Steven Pekin.
Elon Mask subsequently refused his plans to buy shares.

Other prosecutors also noted that Ilona Maska was cautious in the course.
In September, Ilona Maska accused the head of the research company Citron Research.
In the meantime, if Mask had not been able to resolve his dispute with the United States Price Papers and Markets Commission, he would have been threatened to eliminate the management of the company and even the prison.
In particular, the CNBC television was reported by the former chairman of the Commission, Harvey Pitt.

The Master of the White House recalled that the problem of North Korea had been taken from the previous administration as the main challenge in foreign policy.
Tramp noted that the Barak Obama team had so much initiated relations with the CNDR that it couldn't even reach the country's leadership -- they weren't just off the phone.
At that time, the United States and the CNDR were at the front of the war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House "beautiful letters", said Tramp.
Tramp admitted that at the beginning of his work, Kim Chen Inu was also cruel, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationships have been fixed so much that the leaders are "loving one another."
Tramp asked to ignore his word literally and warned that the US media would interpret them as incompetent.

Nico called for the "moscow language" by Ukrainian product.
The Ukrainian child writer and struggle for the purity of Laris Nicoya called for the " Russian language of Moscow and Moscow tongue" from Ukraine.
It suggests that Ukrainian product is a “cultural wave, cultural pressure”.
With its views on the “property of the eradication of Russian language in Ukraine”, Nicoa shared with the Ukrainian edition of the Reverend.
She said that the relevant Ukrainian product is now preparing - it even already eats and continues to develop.
In time, Ukrainians will "be healed" from this "Moscow language", she is convinced.
For example, in the neighbouring Poland, it said that the Russian talk and radio had been widely used before, but it was practically not left in the public space.
However, Nicoe believes that the Ukraines do not apply aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian language are, in her view, a “enlargement of the borders for Ukrainian legislative speech”.
Nicoi had previously shared the experience of the maintenance of the Ukrainian language regime in the Karpata child camp, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened a network of Watsons book stores, one of whom spoke with her in Russian.
Without reaching her, Nico threw her into a girl's shock.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians calls "tongue schizophrenia", calling on Ukraines to quit Russian letters even in writing names.
Nicoy recently stated that the name “Russian” was stolen from Ukraines, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The anger of the writer could not even avoid Ukraine's Security Service: when she came there and heard the talks of staff in Russian, she made a scandal and left by knocking the door.

Yes, the doctor and physician Vladimir Anatolevich Gašnev led me to this game, and thank them so much!

We've got a white bar right now, though it was black at first.
We must continue in the same way and rejoice the cheerers."
"Did you miss the game since you didn't go out?"

"The uniqueness of the current 73th session, in my view, is that the rhetoric that we have almost been used to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been more suppressed," said the senator in the interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in the previous years, the RF was “measured as one of the three major threats to mankind, along with the Ebola fever, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries, which had been said to be unanimous.”
At the 73th session, Kosachev emphasized, " the theme of Russia was almost missing."
"If the president of the United States, President of France, the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia or British, in any case, not exactly," the politician noted that Russia was "no more a wall that was trained by a tennis ball."
The Chief of the Professional Committee of Suffeed did not exclude that this indicated a trend that he considered " to allocate the current session [UN], although the trend may be fully manifested in a year, in two, three."
"I do not exception that the current session may in some way be a turnover," Kosacev explained that "too many examples of how Russia is able to move forward in international affairs."
As an example, he presented situations in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"That is unfortunately not Ukraine, but I do not doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be required in time," the parliamentary added.
This is related to, he believes that there is a “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible, inalienable participant in addressing the global problems of modernity”.
"I don't want to make a mistake, but I feel like we're going somewhere where the movement is not going to move again, it's going to move forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important sense" in this context, Kosachev called "the request for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [on the Genassembly session of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if another year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of the world, most likely, was not interested, the situation is now different," said the Chairman of the Suffed Committee.
In his view, it was due to the fact that “in the so-called new Liberal order, which is characterized with the West, there were no answers to the questions how to address world problems due to the apparent deficit of ideas in global space, the deficit of ideas on how to address the problems of the Middle East, terrorism, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, migration problems”.
"And here the Russian vision request becomes more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed his confidence, stressing that in this regard, "the current session is a successful session for the work of the Russian delegation, which is successful for Russia."

The Anti-Immigrant Alternative for Germany has a further record of popularity, and the ratings of Angela Merkel fall.
Apparently, the Germans began to become seriously tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which made the country aimed for millions of refugees from the Middle East.

However, there is a trend in the loss of scores -- in April, Angela Merkel's support was four per cent higher.
The German Chancellor, which is headed by the German Government, is also reduced in a fourth period in a sequence.
Today, 48 per cent of the Germans are supported by the angels of Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
In addition, after social democrats, green (15 per cent), left (11 per cent) and liberals (10 per cent).

At the same time, the group opposed the "free" of Germany by the weak economies of the EU, not the possibility of returning to the German Mark and the full exit of the country from the European Union.
The Immigration Crisis ' s political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full party, which took a low eurosceptics and began to criticize the Government for the failure of immigration policy.
At the latest parliamentary elections in 2017, ADG was able to break into Bundestag for the first time, having received 94 deputy chairs (from 709).

Date of death of the universe
The universe is still around 140 billion years, which is ten times older than the world observed, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The International Collective of Scientists is presented in the archiv.org e-Print library and is aimed at publication in the Publications of the astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Such conclusions have been made by the experts by watching the Hyper Suprime-Cam telescope of Subaru for about ten million galaxies.
Following the distribution of dark material and dark energy, which is more than 95 per cent of the mass of the observed world, scientists, working under the standard cosmological model ÖCDM (α Cold Dark Matter), evaluated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was a little slower than it was considered earlier.
The press release of the Subaru Observatory notes that the observations allowed a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of materials in the universe, while the accounting of the European Space Telescope data Planck made clear the limits imposed on the ÖCDM parameters.
In July, scientists designed the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments for the world observed to cease its existence in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Break.
A regular attempt to combine pension referendum initiatives has failed
The possibility of learning the people ' s opinion on pension reform is deferred for an indefinite period
In Moscow, on Saturday, a meeting of a general federal referendum initiative was held against the increase of pension age.
It participated by representatives of 13 subgroups registering various formulations of issues (all five formulations were registered by the Centre).
They decided to contact the CIC with a request to register a single initiative group and to ask the Russians: “You are not to increase the pension law as at 1 July 2018, with the right to appoint the Russian citizens to appoint an aged pension?”
This formulation was registered by a vulgarian subgroup whose representatives were not participating in the congregation, but it was considered the simplest and legal ecosystem.
The majority of the Assembly members of the Just Russia (six subgroups) and CPRF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups, from the Lower Novograd, Voronez and Orenburg, joined them.
Rather, Swiridov said "Widomosts " that the invitations were sent to all initiators, and the consent was expressed by representatives of about 40 subgroups.
But for example, Marina Semenova, head of the subgroup of vulgarity (which was supported by another 15 subgroups), said to the Knowledgemen that the invitations were not received and not planned to come, "We didn't understand who was the friend and who was the enemy."

In the Loko game, "Ahmat" of Turbin's mistakes struck like a horn of abundance.
The former Alliance Judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the arbitrator Eugene Turbina at the 9th tour of the Russian Championship "Locomotiv" -- "Ahmat" and resolved the disputed episodes of the game.
- How do you appreciate the Eugenia Turbina collaboration at the Lokomotiv game, "Ahmat"?
- I believe that the arbitral has confirmed its inconvenience to the russian Prime Minister of Liga.
I am surprised that efforts in the fifth round of Spartacus -- "Dinamo", neither Turbin nor DSI leaders have made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The results did not slow down in the ninth tour: errors in its actions, private passages of gross receptions were as an abundance horn.
For example, at the 50th minute of Eder's railway, the Achmath Defenser Rodolfo is in his hand.
It's eight metres from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put a toolbar.
- How do you appreciate the episode with the part of Idova, who was on the 82th minute when the ball seemed to be hit by him?
- I think there was an intentional game by the defendant's hand in his penalty square.
The turbine was close to the moment, well seeing the episode and its first assistant on the right.
This was also to be seen by the reserve Judge Sergei Karasev.
Nevertheless, all three fell asleep, and no tools were appointed.
Therefore, the match was distorted, and sports justice was washed.
This was the same case when the concepts were exhausted and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- At the 52th minute, Turbin did not decide to remove the guest defender, Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Kryhoviak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he was promising applause.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second bracelet?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card showed a little bit of a case.
The second would be irrelevant.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match on double judicial standards that some teams were putting tools for such violations as the episode with Idau, and none.
What do you appreciate the words of the football player?
- Besides, it's under double standards.
There were tools.
They didn't.
So the arbitral does not give a second tool to the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second moment of double standards that the judge is watching who plays.
This is how Lokomotiv played on Saturday, and Ahma has serious claims for Turbin's work because the team was compromised.
Matt Damon played the defendant for rape by Judge Cavano at the start of SNL
The American actor Matt Damon played a candidate at the U.S. Supreme Court of Bretta Cavano, who was accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC television.

I was the most proud, the drunkest virgin ever seen.
Everyone is familiar," said the judge in the execution of Matt Damon.
Cavano was previously elected to the Supreme Judge of the United States.
Barbara Straisand found her cloned dogs strange in behaviour
The American singer Barbra Straisand stated that the clones of her dead dog acted completely different than the original pet.
"They don't look like it.

United States considered the sea blockade of Russia due to the supply of oil and gas
In the United States, the sea blockade of Russia can be launched to benefit from the world energy market.
The American authorities have taken so hard to fight for the success of the world carbon market that they are ready to flee to the sea blockade of Russia, which remains one of the major world energy suppliers.
The capacities of the sea blockade were spoken by the head of the U.S.M.A. Ryan Zinke.
In spite of world practice, the American Ministry of Interior does not perform police, but civilian functions, including the policy of natural resources.
Therefore, the statement of Zinke was fully competed in the office headed by it, although it had not been deprived of political decoration.
During an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that the United States military forces have controlled marine roads in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
Zinke said that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supply from the world's energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive the lion share of its income from the world market of oil and gas.
The desire to allocate energy supplies in the Middle East, as in Eastern Europe, was the main motive for Moscow to be strengthened in this region, Cinque.
The Minister understood that the United States continue to rely on leadership in the world market of energy resources, as the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do so, Washington will have to collapse Russia and Iran, and the sea trading road blockade is an acceptable measure on this path, Seake believes.

The audiences are disturbed by the choice of Agutin at the voting show
The watchers of the 60+ show accuse the teacher Leonid Agutin of "awful courage and sudden subtraction."
When he learned the voice of his father Nicolas Agutin in the blind hearings, many hoped that he would maintain neutrality and not return to the executor.
But the son’s feelings have overcome, and he has chosen a relative to his team.
Many then felt that it was a joke, but forgived the teacher's unacceptability at the first stage.
But the joke was delayed, and the father of the star took the seat of more decent performers.
And now the observers are not willing to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday, as the watchers of the show, we were embarrassed by an unlikely and sincere dragging our relatives into the final staircase.
I had even doubted that Agutin had no strength and conscience to bring to the end of his dad's first place," said Irina Petrovska and Ksenia Larina in the TV Man program.
In the meantime, for his father, Leonid Agutin "sent" the wonderful performers who really sang, while Nicolai Petrovic whispered the touching song about his mother, explaining that the watchers still want to see his father's show.
But it turns out that this is not true, the observers want an objective assessment and to see really talented performers in the final, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"Sympathetic to the voting participants of the Agutin team - they were condemned."
"Last time Agutin showed his love for Dad, and today he had to show himself as a professional."
"The contest has lost its sense."
"Removing two talented people from the project and leaving their dad in the project not singing but whispering, how can you then call the teacher?"
"It likes Daddy's singing, organize a concert in Kremle for your money and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's a voice show, not a cruel family show.
"Agutin's side of it was unprofessional."
"Then we have to invite Dad to play on our own show, not the show that is made for the money of the 1st Channel."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a loud father should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did the worker from Surgut have a great voice and a tamprane, and the pope of Agutin have been brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on the scene and from the screens, the same faces for decades!
'Cause you can't go through the clue.'
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
A circle of mud and bowling.
And the money for the family budget will not be too much!
The theatre of absurds continues!"
The users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Voice, the city's son came out at blind audiences.
Then there was no meter in the head of taking a son into his own team.
Besides, he said, "Come on, get out of here, I understand."
Agutin couldn't do as a professional.

Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
It's an unconscious nonsense to pay attention to such things.
I'm totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the disturbance in the team.
First of all, these are verses, reading and recognizing.
I wouldn't have responded to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has an opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to be buried.
If Shussackov and Stickenko are putting laughs, that doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility of perception of the situation.
And that's not the normal climate in the team.
Today Spartacus has no games, so it wasn't necessary to blow up.
Maybe you and I should have laughed at it together.

"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it's enormous good.
This is an explosive increase in medical technologies, a improvement of life quality and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of natural technologies is actually a technological reproduction of live nature systems.
There is a volunteer, a targeted intervention in human life.
There's always a risk.
The car appeared, and people began to die under wheels.
But the cars are still using.
Double nature of technology at once.
I create a new medical technology and I can create weapons of mass defeat," quotes Scientific REN TV.

The commentators expressed different views: Some of the local inhabitants noted that there was no harm at the graveyard of small breeding animals, and their appetite could even help to clean the territory from grass and growing grass, but some of the inhabitants of the city did not have the behaviour of animals in the heart:
"It's a grave, not a staircase.
There's nothing to do to the lambs.
The barbecues, of course, do not say that they are bothering, but it is not a matter.”
Anyway, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery was already known and soon the necessary measures would be taken.
Pressure and hitting - how is it right?
There is no word for pressure.
That's right.
The word "shuffle" in the meaning of "threatening, affecting, influence" exists only phoneticly, because we hear the sound [a] instead of the word "dule".
We use this word, assuming it comes from the word "pressure".
But the pressure and the "dependence" are not only tymologically close, but even in some ways the opposite.
Make sure you do it yourself.
Doing (the church. book, older) means "satisfactory, full, enough to be satisfied for anyone or anything, to satisfy."
Enjoying, pleasure is family words.
He used to have the meaning of "not depending on anything, having a self-consuming meaning" - "deserving himself."
The old-Slovene "dowl to" is related to the words "will" and "will".
Pressure, suppression is completely different.
These words are truly scary "brothers": daos - "wolk" (pushing sheep), deyja - "death" and "twoidı" - "shuffle".
Similarly, the phonetic form of words " pressure " and " dust " as well as the infinite ageing of the last had caused them to become contaminated.
So we have the very d[a]inflammation, which is also used in the letter through "a", which is well wrong and impossible from the perspective of the emergence and development of these words.
So it's right to do it.
But this word is an older word, in its right meaning is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/humans have a negative impact on you above, use the word "pressure".
You can also use the pressure design, but remember that it is a office.

Mitropolit Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename UPC with fascist actions
The Head of the Synodal Division of Foreign Church of the Russian Orthodox Church compared the rename of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against the Jews.
"It's like that in Fascist Germany, the Jew to put a yellow star on, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and that's the purpose of which the law was created," said the mitropolite in the eter of the "Russia-24" telescope (the "Interfax" quota.
He believed that this step would have the most serious consequences right now when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was in a sharp stage.
Kiev thus hoped to receive full control of the OPC and " to put it outside the law," the priest believes.
"This is the Ukrainian church, and the believers of that church consider themselves Ukraines, they are the patriots of their country," he added.
It was previously known that the High Council Deputies worked on the implementation of draft laws No.4128 (on the change in subjection to religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No.5309 (on the change in the name of religious organizations).

The Deputy of the Pochaev Laura called for the protection of the Orthodox and Ukrainian holidays
Deputy Vice-Uspension Laura Mitropolit Vladimir called for the protection of Orthodox Faith and Ukrainian sanctuary.
The text of his appeal to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (OPC) was published on Saturday on the home site.
In different times of history, our predecessors and the family of faith and spirit had to confess to their faith and protect their holinesses.
Given the situation that has arrived, and on the information we have, and on the threats of the disputes that are spread, it is clear that we will have to experience something," said mitropolit.
He asked for support - praying, moral.
The laura deputy also stressed that it would probably "use your physical presence."
The Holy servant added: "Lenina's grandchildren are in spirit, threatened by a dispute, and therefore we shall protect their holiness."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochaev Laura, the Orthodox Orthodox and the World Holiness, must be prepared to protect it, says the treatment.
Mitropolith called on not to go for those who have deceived believers.
OPC has a canonical status as defined by Thomas of 29 October 1990 by the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to introduce a new patriarch and a friend of the Catholic Pope of Roman Barfolomé.
The new style with its implications is inappropriate.
And we are pleased with the status that our church has," said the deputy laura.
He recalled that OHC had been canonically independent and fully independent in its office since October 1990.
There is no administrative accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Thomas already has our church.
What else do we need?" said the Mitropolitan Pochaevski Vladimir, calling upon the believers and all citizens to ask whether other religions of Thomas are independent of the Vatican?
The believers have somehow come to understand and have determined what the temple they are going to.
However, someone would like to reinstat enmity and dispute.
Some are envious of the shining of the dome in the temples that they want to destroy," the priest emphasized.
The Pochaev laura is the largest temple complex and a monastery in Western Ukraine.
Laura is located at the top of the Pochaev Mountain, 70 miles from Ternopol.
The first historical information on it relates to the beginning of the XIII century.

Macedonians are prepared to vote at the EU and NATO referendum, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement on the rename of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right to be called Macedonia, taking into account the attempt on a single-named Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, politologist: " Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia has the right to a better future, hope for public change.
And Greece will reinforce the right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises, they cannot make it absolutely happy for all."
For the rename of the country, ruling social democrats are headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Conservative opposition and President of the country, George Ivanov.
According to the journalist Cvetina Chilimanová, Macedonia has no point in entering the EU - it is sufficient to have partnerships with it: "Most of those who do not like the agreement, believe that the current socialist Government, headed by Zaev, is immune to change the country's name.
But this decision will result in negative consequences.
First of all, I lose sovereignty.
Clearly, there are countries that do not wish Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia stands before the greatest challenge in its history.
The country was a dispute.
The choice made by Macedonian citizens will not only determine the future of the Balkans but also Europe as a whole."
