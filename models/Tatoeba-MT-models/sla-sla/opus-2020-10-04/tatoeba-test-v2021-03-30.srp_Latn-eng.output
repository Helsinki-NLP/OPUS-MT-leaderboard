You're sad.

Tom's gonna change.
I reacted instinctfully.
You have to do that somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.

It's almost half three.
I don't know if that's gonna be enough money for me.
Can you get the curtains?
Have you ever tried?

Share your cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
You really don't have to do that.
I hope it'll be a dry time.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunch next day?

What Tom suggests could save time to all of us.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy now.
We're not proud of it.

Everybody else.
Come closer.

We need to act now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
We're here to play golf.
Actually, I've never met Tom.

This is no doubt an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

Do you have your favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!

Could that be true?
Quiet, Tom.
I hope Tom is safe.

Let's get away.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her tonight.
I had to make some difficult decisions.
Ammonia is a base.
Check it again.
Are you honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what I have to do.
Nothing's been told to me.

Bad time stopped me from leaving.
Tom bought the papers.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
The black smoke was coming out of the chimney.
I know a gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
I was honest and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
What's this?
Tom's asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom's only talking to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You're so fast.
Tom's gonna work.
I got off the train.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
No one is as fast as you are.
I agreed to buy that.
Am I the only one who's going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't go into that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as high as you are.
How many years have you been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never get involved in your foolish business.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's saving to buy a yacht.
Everyone except Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
The new branch towards Haugesund will become the main effective travel link to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire Western region.
You let me down.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects Mary and I have something to do.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not easy sport.
I'm just not gonna do that.
You shouldn't have bought that.
Their right is to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Are we going to see Tom again?
My mother's cooking for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
The woman eats bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have ate something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Avoid the addicts on the color dilutioner.
I liked that one.
Do you like rollers?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did that.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom so much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were kidding her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom was rolling around the room, not able to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Rest, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come in sometime?
She wonders how it's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose a beautiful one.
Look what she's like!
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have difficulty talking about my feelings.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were kidding her.
I'm not sure when Tom will be here.
You should come home.
Alice was smiling.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic finger moves, creating a very pleasant music to listen.
The strong winds broke a lot of tree branches last night.
Shouldn't you be preparing for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
The way to the man's heart leads over the stomach.
It's time to get up.
The house is built from a brick.
I didn't write this.
I can't without feeling partially responsible.
People were good to me.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried?
I could go with you.
Take a little.
Come in.
You really don't have to do that.
I wonder what Tom is planning to do.
You need to know how to read the notes to join the choir.
Tom's got a nightmare.
They wanted an apology.
Where was I wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you a little later.
Why me?
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in the house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It's very natural for human beings to always give himself the advantage of the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I've got a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was attending school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Deep, insensitive children can grow up in sociopates sometimes.
I'd like her to be with you.
The police's job is to stop and investigate crime.
Can you give me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We all work too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's learning very fast.
You're different.
She knows the hatred of others.
This will make our job much easier.
He loves football.
The monks were able to play tennis in the monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Who's Tom, is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if I might dream.
Everything's changing in time.
No one's going anywhere.
Drive to work from an hour and a half.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorce.
He's here.
I'll make up something.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us think that such views are just crazy.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary while he wasn't here.
We're sick of you.
We all know Tom was guilty.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled out a thicker end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a mild pain.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books before.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great pains.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write the number?
That's not the reason for panic.
I only got 20 points at the mathematics test.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I married.
Explore this.
My future is in your hands.
It's a fake, isn't it?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him a day earlier.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
That's so sad.
How clever!
Shortly, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
I've been playing piano a long time ago, so I still can do a little bit.
Is this your glass, or your sisters?
The battle took a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
He said he had to work in the garden two hours a day.
Apples and crushes are given, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
I really like to practice.
I'm really proud of it.
We were in the last place.
I've contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're absolutely right.
Come, sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this now.
Time to break up.
What kind of food do you like cooking?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The meeting performance is ready.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you even eating?
I don't like being convicted.
I have an appointment tonight.
A man hopes as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
That was a funny movie.
Bitcoin is a crypto.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go check it out.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Oh..." "So, do you remember the one she sent to you when you asked her to give you the pictures of the Eplexek brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write the criticism of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent the criticism of Mac." "Yes." "Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from that?" "I realized that Philips' s scratch is persuasive, but not deceptible; and that Rerite is awfully charged with things that I think she should do as a friend."
I always liked horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I overlook that?
I'm only going to church for respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day like a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don't have to eat right before you get to bed.
Tom's gonna wait.
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'm not a nightbird.
Tom bought me a VIP ticket.
I'm the one who should do that.
Tom's gonna call.
He fired the torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a very good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom quit college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some room.
There's the truth about what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your screaming.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make a place.
The horse must have screwed up and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm investigating it right now.
She's achieved her goal.
Tom can do whatever he wants, as far as I am concerned.
Tom said he needed money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what both of them like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never goes on a train.
Two sides will speak this week.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in a gypsy.
Mom just went shopping.
I'm always nervous on passport control.
That needs help.
Defend yourself.
He caught a cab to the hospital.
Do you know how to žongl?
Don't touch the lion while he's sleeping.
Tom's unliked.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
Honestly to be, I don't know.
That's your choices.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the dogs.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient's breathing.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I so different?
Whose manuscript is this?
That's a good feeling.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sad to leave.
The eagle is the emperor of birds.
The fire took the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you got this wrong.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to the information.
I'm punished.
The cat lied in the entire length of the sunlight that ran through the window.
You're going to school on a walk or a bike?
Tom's not much happier.
Am I the only one to go to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't very impressed with that.
I left Tom 2013.
Mary knows that her main weapon, a beautiful face and a young body, a passive value.
I saw a mouse.
He's trying.
Two countries negotiated a peace agreement.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me now.
It seemed like they knew what they were looking for.
You tried.
We're just gonna follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try it.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
That needs a dream.
That's what I need to tell Tom.
I don't live in that city.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Tom's not a kid anymore.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
I'm used to doing that.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll let you know.
I reacted instinctively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was naked and boss.
She's just out of my league.
What are we actually looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are services paid by taxes.
What does the doctor think it's wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like we're just the two of us.
Today things are very different.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very condemning.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it in an old way.
Where's Teheran?
Let's take a look at that again.
It sounds like treason to me.
That's what we need to practice.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Under the drawing, he wrote, "Keep the viers!"
He's driving slowly.
What a man you are!
Measures twice, cut once!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save some time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why is this language? Because it is beautiful and stimulates our learning at the same time. The international language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. Besides, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you get some sleep?
I'll take you to Tom.
Could it be Tom?
I have three beautiful grandchildren.
Don't argue.
She got her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
Forgive me, I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom showed up to heaven.
I didn't care.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything strange.
You never arrived in time.
That sounds like treason to me.
I'll try not to disturb you while you're studying.
Life's short.
They'll know.
All the participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's going to make progress.
Tom was totally scared.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt at all.
We have to run away.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not selective.
That's what I'm used to doing.
Tom's still at work.
You think better when you close.
Are we all here?
I'm turning around.
Tom was screaming from pain.
Anything or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I've contributed.
I'll sign it.
Shame him.
Exactly.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like scientific fantastic?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom is rich and free.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
That's not exactly my job.
I turned around.
To be honest, I don't know.
I hope she'll be fine.
The wind calmed down.
In my bedroom, I have a mirror from the floor to the ceiling.
I wish I had remembered that.
Don't sound like that.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
The Festival was held in Latvia.
We're what we are.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in there.
Nobody's coming to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start right now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How's this your fault?
Security has been increased in the city.
Cheers!
Tom will stay.
That boy's talking like he's an adult.
The carrots cost three dollars.
My bike is new.
Tom told me today that he loved me.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I escort you home?
I've already tried that.
Go upstairs.
There's no parking permitted.
I'm running early.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's how it's important.
How long have you stayed?
Tom's a passionate bikeman.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's take a look.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom's family used to move.
We liked food, especially fish.
And they lived happy for the rest of their life.
Tom's too poor to hire a lawyer.
Don't look at it.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom was accidentally made.
Is the handsome man Arab or Hindi?
Let's meet you for a drink.
I forget where I leave my hat.
He's screwed up again.
I want to see the ocean, too.
Don't even write!
Who's not doing this?
Tom does it sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
How about I do that?
Let's discuss your idea.
Tom said he was innocent.
All girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Cover your mouth while coughing, sniffing or screwing.
Tom bites nails.
He was a man who never hesitated to resist.
Probably a periodic appearance of rage comes because ice floating from Siberia can wear polar foxes on them.
I heard you weren't eating meat.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I have a memory problem lately.
I'm a Canadian.
I'll try.
Am I ever wrong?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's official business.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.
Is he your new boyfriend?
Forget it.
I agreed to buy it.
What does the paper say?
The sun's surface temperature is about 6000°C.
He asked himself a lot of questions about Islam
If we start right now, we'll be there by 2:30.
What did you two do?
Where's Tom going to sleep?
Why would Tom want that?
It's hard to figure out what really happened.
She passed her fingers through her hair.
Tom's working hard to endure his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom says he has four houses in five different countries.
Let's see what Tom says.
I'm hungry.
Don't argue.
Come here.
Just tell me you're okay.
Is he your new boyfriend?
I'm not afraid of getting old.
I don't fully agree with you.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream now, before it's melted.
I'm just doing my duty.
I made my first step.
I like to watch you play.
It's hard for what we said to apply in practice.
How long's your head hurt?
Ole, the oldest eagle in the world, just died, he was about 150 years old.
Come on for a meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I'm asleep.
Your mother put a collage on the top shelf.
Have you seen anyone there?
My father is so old that he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I'd like to know how to paint like that.
I'll try and find them.
I've had a problem dealing with this problem.
I don't know what it's not, yet or just before, it was good, but several times when I was trying to get on the site today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually seem happy?
I went there with my will.
You better think when you close your eyes.
They really meant that.
Have you ever been here?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
They're all here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm adaptive.
The prison fugitive was quickly captured again.
Everything seemed possible at that time.
I sent a map to Tom on fax.
I have memory problems these days.
Tom may not arrive for a meeting.
Tom died almost the same moment.
The judge slammed the hammer.
They also discovered that the same wrong assessment was made in some other cases.
Try to stay cool, Tom.
We need to find Tom.
I hope this will never happen again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed for a few days.
Tom could be here.
I'll do anything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was just a matter of time.
Don't blink.
He should be able to change.
Does Tom have a cable?
Those who want to stay can stay.
If the rental period is extended outside the contracted period, the proportionate rent supplement shall be calculated.
Why should I tell Tom?
Let your imagination be willing.
Tom knows the names of all his customers.
Tom's keeping over 80% of his earnings.
Are we safe now?
We're what we are.
He's not honest at all.
That's wonderful!
That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm disclexic.
You helped me a lot.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
It just has to be like that.
I'll come when I can.
Don't get divorced.
It's not all the gold that shines.
Are we all here?
We need to focus on our virtues.
How fast!
Faith can move mountains.
I'm not surrendering!
Tom fell off the truck while he feeded the Irvasas.
Tom became a plunger even though his parents wear that they wanted.
I think we've met before.
I've been wrong before.

It's treason.
I'm not late, am I?
Let's go get Tom.
Tell me where you live.
You don't remember anything?
Tom's drinking a lot.
I'm not from here.
Tom was sitting on the grass under the coconut tree.
Everybody laughed.
I'm more creepy than I look.
I don't want you to see me naked.
Can I go?
Tom doesn't like to do that.
Do you have a copy?
Come help me.
I barely left the house when it started raining.
Tom likes to be busy.
First of all.
Tom's just lazy.
I'm a little depressed.
Does that mean you love me?
Check this out.
Is there any evidence?
You have to be strong!
Are you ready for more?
Tom turned on a blink.
Tom always makes me laugh.
She rarely, perhaps never, goes to bed 11 hours ago.
Are they all crazy?
What are you even eating?
How weird he is.
I'm pulling the line here.
Take attention to school rules.
Keep digging.
What school did you go to?
Can I hear another one?
Everybody escaped.
I've already written to Tom.
Tom had to rewrite the composition.
You want to get involved?
I knew I wasn't supposed to get involved in your scratched business.
Tom asked me for permission to use my computer.
Did I really be so happy?
Tell me what this says.
I'm not upset anymore.
Did Tom change his mind?
Get out of here.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
His younger brother is a famous football player.
I was too busy.
I already ordered it.
How does that work?
Will we see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
That's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what that is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It would be hard.
She's making his meals.
Where did you learn English?
Beauty lies in the eyes of the observers.
How do you feel today?
That needs a reason.
Okay, what's a secret?
Are we starting soon?
Did you see me dancing?
I'm starving.
He lives in a white house.
Tom's playing the piano very well.
Tom managed to get away in time.
I don't know anything about her.
You're just hit.
I'm here for you.
I'm not rich enough.
Seniors should pay for their hats and dresses.
Do I see him?
Don't move!
Tom was guilty of everything.
I've been training for months.
What was the plan at all?
You should be here at half one at the latest.
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
I saw a null horse in the zoo.
I think about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
Don't go out tonight.
It's not easy to entertain Tom.
He's a man of a word.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke on two parts.
Muriel's 20.
Have you eaten anything?
Did you go see Tom?
Tom's gonna work.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
It's a window from the glass.
Are you done yet?
Does Tom have the key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
You'll be better in a few days.
That's what Tom would like us to do.
Tom said I should ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not really upset at all.
Tom's a book mole.
I changed my mind.
The problem is, it's too expensive.
Many would love to be motivated, creative, thoughtful creatures, only if they were given that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
Tom's always making a mess of things.
That's not the right thing.
Please record everything I say.
I wish you could sleep.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're barbecue.
I thought you were married.
Somehow I'll find the money.
I assumed you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We should move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like eating a white bowl in the morning.
I think Tom is very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Come get a drink with me.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to the American Polish Hospital.
We'll run in the park.
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you read it?
We need to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.
I know Tom let you down.
Tom was severely hurt.
If you need help, tell me.
I did my first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
First leaves at 17:30 and comes at 8:25.
That was a little weird.
Does that read and write Japanese?
Tom put a ticket on his table.
It was all just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
It usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now the word from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't stop.
It's time to sleep.
Tom wanted to have a more beautiful cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring a fan?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know the reason.
How are you feeling?
Bitcoin and etherium are virtual currency.
Everything's very cheap.
Anything you remember can help.
Many predictions are not fulfilled.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.
I'm poor.
Tom likes a good party.
I don't care what he says.
Mary knows all about the latest fashion trends.
He's a man with many talents.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
Tom was Mary's first love.
The proposal was implemented by a vote of hands up.
Tom may have to stay here for a few days.
My father doesn't like football.
This hat is from Australia.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Go take a look.
I thought the food was great.
I'm deaf and I'm not eating.
You look fat.
You need to learn English a step by step.
That's better than it was before.
Tom and Mary are different as heaven and the earth.
Tom asked me about the opinion of who's gonna win the race.
Man has a lot of desires that he does not really want to be fulfilled and would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wishes that they remain only wishes, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of these desires is and the desire for everlasting life. If it was fulfilled, a man would become completely sick of everlasting life, and would want death.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car alone.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together.
The news came.
No one really wants us.
Everyone paid for it.
Be careful.
I'm alone.
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
The price of gold is changing every day.
Tom married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You have no permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is it interesting to take pictures of trains?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a hooker.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Beethoven wrote nine symphony.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
Do you like costumes?
I saw Marcus' house.
It's really pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
The house in which Atturk was born in Thessalonica.
People are wrong.
He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
Let's hear your excuse.
They formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog was lying.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
No, no, no, no.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
Don't exaggerate.
I can't approve this project.
Are you sending a message to Mary?
I'll keep your place in the first row.
Mary's pushing her kids to play football.
Are they here yet?
Don't forget to give me back my pen.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What did you conclude?
I was praying for you.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
It's just a few minutes away.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In a childhood, many violent criminals have tortured animals insensitively.
How long are you gonna be angry and yelling at us?
How important does that really matter?
Shall we have an aperitive?
If you want, I'll teach you to play ukulele.
I'm already used to it.
It's not that bad.
I like to play the music my friends wrote.
Tom admitted it.
It's hard to work with you.
Tom's growing up.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer.
Bring some wine.
Things aren't always the way they seem.
Show me the photos!
It's necessary for a few old houses to crash.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom sneaked into the party.
Tom's very careful.
When are you going?
This report has not been written well.
She stresses that this last government move has multiple meaning.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget to smash yourself with a sun cream.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's judgment.
Tell me what this is.
His hair was covering his face almost all over.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh country in the world by size.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean up his roof snow?
I'll pay you back.
A student from Oslo who fake his graduation to enter college was sentenced to jail.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish that had occurred to me.
Tom made vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You were really good to me.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I normally look happy?
It's not the problem of the essay itself, but all these destructive questions and explanations of words make me crazy!
He's here on the weekend.
Looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
It was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like that before.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
Clean up a little.
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people love chicken.
I didn't do that either.
Let's take a look again.
The last time I went to the beach, I burned hard.
Stand back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We fixed some damage caused by scratching stones on your car.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
Do you doubt me?
Luckily, Tom didn't hurt himself seriously.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try your way.
How can I resist?
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car alone.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I married.
Don't let anyone in!
We're not going into that.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled out a thicker end.
He's not equal to him.
It's all right with me.
Obviously, Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve, and then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese; so, it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember that song.
I need a honest girl.
She's a starter.
Are they still here?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom so much.
Tom won't escape.
I'd go.
Get down!
Tom couldn't stand that.
Anything you remember can help.
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're a thorn in the eye of those like you, but this is just a mess.
Tom's gonna work.
There's no free lunch.
Please leave this place clean as you would like to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do that.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
That's your life.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I sympathize.
Stop regretting yourself.
Learn yourself by doing it.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
They won't take it.
There is no rule without exceptions.
Maybe you need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
Tom's going to graphical design school.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unsatisfactory.
You should face reality.
We managed to escape exactly in time.
I'm sick of it.
Tom doesn't fit here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
It should work.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens.
Take a little.
He's talking about others so he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know which question to ask.
Find Tom.
I think it's okay.
Whatever you think?
You changed my life.
The reaction is not always the best way to act.
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who complained should be compensated with a proportionate part of annual compensation.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory, it's possible, but it's practically very difficult.
But it was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's disrupted.
Remember the file names before you try to retrieve the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
I didn't get nervous about that.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
Many things go out of my hand.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of work.
Tom was always a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom was preparing for an exam?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
There's no need to be stone in the glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
Don't be a scratch.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
I'm probably not watching TV tonight.
Did Tom pull out a thicker end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
The girl's seeing the boy.
It's very difficult, almost impossible to find a apartment in Oslo.
My French still isn't very good.
It happened right here.
I don't know well Latin.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I'm waiting for my turn.
I've been shaken by a lot of news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I passed every test.
There's no point just to wait for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
It's a area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Snow was falling yesterday.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a backup key in his garden.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I went out on the wrong bus station.
I wrote this song only for you.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Will you send this as a mail shipment?
What are you suggesting?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
Sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give me that.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of some language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They slowly moved forward.
I survived.
Do you know how this machine is used?
Don't blink.
Blue stands for you.
Come visit us soon.
Have you been in an accident?
Tom's worried about what could happen.
He was a honourable man.
My father doesn't like football.
We're all out of alcohol.
Card, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
My friend lives to God behind his feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you gonna do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
That's Tom.
Tom still looks worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary's a very shy girl.
Tom doesn't have such a problem.
You can't hide secrets from me.
It just happened again.
There's a hard day waiting for you.
It's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't be part of it.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully satisfied.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay in there tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always act rational.
I didn't even do that.
Did you pass your exams?
I sincerely support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Did we agree?
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went that way.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom was afraid of me before.
Tom whispered something to Mary, and she smiled.
May I take a look at your card?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
It's clean.
Today's your daughter's birthday.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
Apparently, it's a knocking error.
Your book is double bigger than mine.
We're both not rich as much as we want.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a nice garden.
The cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom has disgusting hair.
I've seen enough for now.
That's what I hate.
We'll miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's gonna look at it.
Here's what I think.
I could go with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you deactivate the bomb?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples that Tom gave her to make an apple butter.
How many songs did you write?
We're glad to have you here.
You can write in any language.
How can we manage others when we can't manage ourselves?
Don't rush.
You can learn, regardless of age.
He dedicated his life to a vision of what he wanted to create for himself and others.
Did you give it to Tom?
Who have you been helping in recently?
Just close your eyes.
Tom's a little worried.
How is this your fault?
How did I overlook this?
What should I write here?
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptive.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for vote.
How many times have you been here?
He's fixing electronic devices.
You're losing.
I'm ready, bro.
Please kick as strong as you can.
This fish is big.
Send me some sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed.
I hope we figure this out.
We all have to resist this.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came to a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired that I can barely keep my eyes open.
Bring me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where did you find the keys?
Have you ever hung a video on YouTube?
I was very interested in building a more intense academic programming plan.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you now.
Mary used sticks for walking that helped her with the climbs and falls in the journey.
The compass shows north.
Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very condemning.
Whose initiative is this done?
Finish this.
Which one do you want me to take?
I like cable meals.
Where's your friend?
When do we start eating?
The Queen and the King have reunited their powers.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
Flowers have been fully introduced.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book at least.
Blue looks good for you.
Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said he would be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother John.
I'd take it.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep silent all the time?
He took off.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I dislocated my right shoulder.
You really need to take a shower.
What is the purpose of life?
Drive a poll.
My right hand's stuck.
I don't know much about you.
Did you do anything?
You should probably talk a little slower.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
A bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
Crazy!
You're paying me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Take everything.
I resigned.
Everything's wrong.
It's all ruined.
The marriage between the same half is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland since yesterday.
Take this home with you.
She bought bread.
We'll try in your way.
Get yourself out of here.
You deserve to congratulate you.
Since the message was in French, I read it easily.
Finish this.
Tom tried to answer Mary to that.
Can you give me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
Everyone's gone.
I'll learn more hard.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us saw Tom do that.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
You wrote my name wrong.
You're different.
Shame her.
I have two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
I didn't care about that.
Some of them were and are still in constant danger because of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still don't think the Internet is a place for children.
That was hard for me.
What did you conclude?
You're made for me.
He needs it.
Apparently it's a typefiller.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom broke into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a tiny guy.
Control yourselves.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
There'll be bad things going to happen.
A few trees fell during the storm in our surroundings.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
Everybody smiles.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I'm quitting.
Tom looked mad.
Don't exaggerate.
Oh, yeah, I'll have a job tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think I'm doing very good writing.
Tom's no longer a member of this club.
That's a lot of help.
I filled the glass.
I'm not selective.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
That morning, Mary visited the entire village.
The rumor has spread quickly.
Am I so different?
Tom pulled out the keys and opened the door.
I just arrived.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It's helping.
Dima slept with 25 men during one night and then he killed them.
I'm not doing that again.
I didn't think you could do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we arriving soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who'll be there.
Are you mad about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
The expenses will rise soon.
Did I really be so happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar to me.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.
Do they suspect me?
What do you have to do?
Tom likes to drive.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.
The winter's over, spring's over.
It's really so simple.
Since the papers were written about not a farmer who wants to work as a vendor in Westfold, the interest has rapidly increased.
I'm punished.
I have to go inside.
We're a little busy here.
Get on board.
It's really surprising.
Have you ever seen UFO?
You're standing in my way.
It's become dark.
What's a big secret?
The police are chasing me.
I made my first step.
I hope Tom will remember this.
We ask the teacher questions every day.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
If the world hadn't been able to do what it is now, I could trust anyone.
Three wounded, which are currently unbelievable of their condition, have been evacuated to the US Polish Hospital.
I was praying for you.
Etherium and bitcoin are cryptooluts.
Hello, can you hear me?
We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Every time I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, people?
Will you help me?
It didn't get so much worse.
Tom took his chairs to the next room.
I'm destroyed.
I respect such people.
Did you see it work?
Is that yes or not?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for today.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, there is a general precaution to avoid infections in this type of patient.
I'm a free man.
I don't like screwed people.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
That could be a weapon.
I can't fix the car alone.
I'd better go with Tom.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be preparing for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips screwed into a vicious smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Mary's enthusiasm for the course fell down when her favorite lecturer moved.
I don't want to be rude.
I guess you already know the answer.
Tom was nervous when he was starting a new job.
Help me.
The United States threw a atomic bomb on Hiroshim 1945.
Are you reading something interesting?
Smoking here is not allowed.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom's always very nice.
I barely closed my eye.
Was Tom here when we arrived?
Was I really so happy?
I took off my wig.
Tom won't be happy to hear that.
Tom was named by his father.
Did he really commit suicide with that?
I'm going to get some sleep.
What was I supposed to do?
Stay away from my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend, I was just pretending.
Did I drop that?
I just want to get out of here.
Why do you think that?
Little kids like to touch everything.
She screwed her hair to the papillots.
He was released from military service.
My right blood is bleeding.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which one of your friends will come?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play many times.
You tried.
I'm taking you to dance.
Tom may try to convince Mary to do that.
She's making elephant mosquito.
You told me not to lie.
He used to be a member of the social elite than a representative of wide mass.
I'm scared.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't hurry.
Give me the pen.
Just tell Tom I called.
There's no answer to the question what's best, because it's always individual and depends on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
You look like a very smart person.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year to perfection.
The house burned up to the ground before the firefighters arrived.
The most rain months are May, June, July and August.
Do I normally seem happy?
I've already written a part of the report.
I was ready for that.
Show me the documents.
It's about...
It could be hard about passion, maybe it's just sex.
Are you done washing the courts?
I'm the only one who can do it here.
Tom's gonna pay.
The money season's over.
I love cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom around?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I'm almost never home during the day.
The best parents of all are those who let their children follow their inherent talents.
I would've gone.
You're very inadmissible.
You let me down.
There's snow all year in this mountain.
I don't think you should get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bitch.
What's in nature forever, when everything is so passing?
The engine's warming up.
I'll see you later!
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
This may not be enough.
You got that nicely.
Everything you have will have you one day.
Whatever Tom's busy, he never forgets our e-mail to his shirt at least once a week.
The dog is dead.
This is life.
Do we have any of that?
Is this your suitcase?
Tom stopped for a second.
Because of the bad time, the plane's late.
Explore them.
I'm in a better shape than you.
I'm not so worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
I think it's possible to do that.
I'm going to get some rest in about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
He first made a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test before he was sent to the lab test.
We walked in the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
It was a stressful day.
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom was looking closely.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
What's your job?
Let's continue the debate.
How much do I get?
I want to be with you.
This was delicate and depicted in the personality of so strange, cruel and stubborn that little of who dared to cooperate closely with him.
She's pregnant.
Don't move!
I could get there by 2:30.
Merauke is the most eastern city of Indonesia.
Tom used to come here as a student.
We'll take the next one.
Did you do your homework?
Check everyone.
Tell us a story about ghosts.
Check everyone.
The session's over.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We need to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
How does she look?
I'm pathetic.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way here.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
Cut cheese on thin pieces or small cubes.
Have you ever experienced a car accident?
I'd like to start.
I wasn't wearing intrusive clothes.
I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, that sentence has caused a real confusion.
Give food to the homeless.
I've translated the song as much as I could.
He walked out a few minutes ago.
I believe you're honest.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom's got an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Although I was sick, I did my best.
Big boys don't cry.
I could go there now.
I need to write ten pages for next Monday.
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I need to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student in the department.
I'm touched.
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Why?
"Where should I sit?" "Whereever."
Wiseness is needed to understand: music does not exist for a deaf audience.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
The troubled children are often without any guilt.
I feel bad because I lied.
I invited him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom got red.
Tell him.
How do you get rid of the mole in the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like working at home.
Of course, Tom loves his children.
Where are you now?
It's very likely that FIFA was rotten to the heart.
She gave me a contradictorous answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He's wearing a golden chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of it.
Atturk was born in 1881, in Thessalonica.
At least Tom's honest.
I want to answer the last question first.
Did you tell Tom this?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only five in the morning, and there's already a light outside.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there's a cross-border, it'll happen sometimes.
Tom's ruling francs well.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
I know this is weird.
He never overcome his son's death.
I'm just doing my duty.
Everyone's sitting down.
If you don't have anything else to do, then the number of the Greek islands.
She's always wearing wooden clothes.
Is that almost going to solve the matter?
Mary put the ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to do that.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Tom seemed older and mature than the other boys.
It'll take forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She smiled.
The gifts of Višnua are called Vishnuans; the gifts of Shiva are the Shivans.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You're grown up.
I totally lost my thoughts.
I've never repented for doing that.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Roma?
Tom came to see me yesterday at noon.
Hello, buddy!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be a place.
If you don't be a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known all the time.
"I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Well, somewhere in things that people make I want to see scars, failure, mess, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I refused Tom.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd buy that one.
This overcomes all the borders.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Apparently, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom reads a lot.
I hope you're not talking about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm usually not this busy Monday.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "if not Q, then not P."
My wedding must be perfect.
Move.
We should learn.
We don't have a choice.
When this is time, it's best to sit home and not go out.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During the observation power experiment, Tom couldn't describe any pictures from the wall of his living room, even though he lived there for two years.
She's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
Everybody kept their breath.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I like watching you work.
I hope we'll visit Beijing, too.
You're my inspiration.
This time I abstained from commenting on my loved friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did anyone call me?
We'll have lunch together at half one.
I'm still a little tired.
To seek to maximize his own interest, happiness or security seems very natural to one human being.
I can do it like a joke.
I'm not singing.
It's weird that no one knows the victim.
We're out of here for five minutes.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is not as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit that.
It was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything okay between us?
I've never been camping.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on the tree that we broke and discovered it was thirty years old.
See you later, Tom.
Would you like fruit juice?
Let's schedule a meeting.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still seems shaken.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people like it.
Maybe they're leaving tomorrow.
Come here, I want to show you something.
I'm remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're afraid of me.
I was happy yesterday.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one helped us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you been living here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
He still has no experience in this job.
Can you help us?
Will you cool up?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about his experiences.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Who can't be proud of being Serbia, with their historical highest achievements - the slaughter of heads and genocides?
Do you know how to deactivate the bomb?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom lost his feeling.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom's gonna look at it.
I'm wondering if anyone could help me, but I have a cell phone that just shows a bug message.
I'm surprised.
Everyone was smiling.
I played a golf with Tom a lot of times.
You underestimate me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said we should stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can speak liquidly to Hindi.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written a part of the report.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
It was a little weird.
I really enjoyed it.
No one died... yet.
Can we, people, cook grass and get food ingredients out of it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote a stick on the ground.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Enjoy yourself!
The chances are against me.
I'll quit.
He expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you understood me wrong.
That's good.
I'm not gonna get you up.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom saw enough.
Are we leaving soon?
They're selling sugar in the store.
Tom and Mary were watching sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does it sometimes.
Thank Tom for your help.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
Photos of nature and animals, painted in complete silence and calmness, are real work.
My mother died the day I married.
I'll never mention this again.
You don't have permission to go into that room.
We have two kids.
I think Tom's careful.
The white family will come to Tokyo at half eleven.
What did you do to me?
Enjoy it.
Let me write your steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks cute, whatever she wears.
Watch out!
Tom failed to provide any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad nature.
I'm on my way.
I bought this yesterday.
I had a lot of bad day.
The whole country's talking about it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made a omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm disgusting.
I was happy yesterday.
The way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
It's not the best time now.
He's not a kid anymore.
I'm trying to get a futon at least twice a week.
My education has made me what I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join me?
Leave the book on the upper shelf.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Take everything.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia resigned.
Be careful.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I've had a problem dealing with this problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you such information.
I didn't do it.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
Just a second, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom still looks shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(no P) and/or Q."
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came here a little sooner than usual today.
I could eat a horse.
Actually, I never met Tom.
What's easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
I've never noticed that before.
This should work.
I always liked Tom more.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train on his way to work.
I have house ghosts.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cookie for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Let me try another one.
You're working slowly.
I didn't do that either.
The Stories of Snory Sturluson are talking about the spread of Christianity in Norway by violence.
Answer me now.
Feel like home!
Students didn't know how to answer.
I'll try and convince Tom to do that.
Am I so different?
I screwed up.
I assumed you were busy.
That elegant golden chain with the hearts is a necklace that's gonna shake your world.
Everything happened with lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It's been raining.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Take more.
You're irrational.
I'm mad.
The holiday dinner was held in the White House.
Planning should be left to me.
You can avoid a lot of trouble if you just do the right thing from the first time.
Marie jumped out of the window into the river.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm scared.
I'm great.
Did you expect something else to happen?
John and Mary always walk by holding hands.
Where was I wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I missed so many opportunities.
It helped me a lot.
Give me another case.
Tom still has a little time.
It's a boring baseball.
Tom was more than generous.
I just screwed it up.
I'm sure it wasn't deliberate.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We lost ourselves, didn't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a ticket.
Nothing happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth has to be said.
Look at how much it is!
We need to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, he's working on his engine.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger ship than his brother.
Tell me what that is.
Let's hope Tom is smart.
For breakfast, I always eat fruits and owls.
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear that he doesn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that water quality be checked once a year in pipes, twice in the well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people when they have to turn your attention to one or the other thing about you, your attitudes or your appearance, for example.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into a big shit.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of the dogs that lay.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary for a long time.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Can I interrupt you for a moment?
Students didn't know how to answer.
It's a good intention.
I've been thinking about it before.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
Girls were sleeping.
I'm just looking around.
Do you want to know something specific?
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
Interability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously hurt in an accident.
Two-thirds of the students were on a meeting.
My mother's not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You're opening the door.
That's good.
Is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Did you see my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
I'm objective.
Nine of the ten voters believe that Mary is the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom will not vote at these elections.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
I'm probably not gonna read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Make a place.
Tom is very famous in Australia.
Be careful.
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who's going with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
We were never separated.
I'm 30.
Give me my bottle back.
I'm really happy to be here.
At that point, it exploded with a big blast.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 percent of the Norwegian population are free from drinking water from surface sources.
What's she drinking?
Tom's very rude.
Don't forget to write the date.
Clear this mess.
Could you read that?
That's perfectly normal.
They say there was a new restaurant built.
The price of this book is five dollars.
Can you keep secrets?
I assumed you were busy.
When the fire exploded, he slept greatly.
I never thought about it.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Tom explained the details, but I still don't understand.
That wouldn't like it.
I'm really curious.
Tom parked twice.
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the account.
There are islands on the sea.
I've never had trouble sleeping.
I didn't see anything.
Any other options?
The amount for the work done and the interest in the investment capital was a few million.
I can't wait to see you tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't fully agree with you.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
Week has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about it.
Will you come to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'll be back late.
The sea's up, the sea of people.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear Tom hates us.
I don't want any beans.
It's been a long time since I sent a letter to anyone.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom works about nine hours persistently.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom said.
I'll take a shower.
We have four hours of French every week.
Let's start now.
I can't think about it while I'm doing it.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
It's our only hope.
I got on my left foot today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a presentation to the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Tom wasn't practicing.
Thank you so much!
Keep the remnant.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do a test again.
Why would Tom surrender?
Europeans have gained advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I was eating yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
That makes me very angry.
Is there still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
I recognized him at first sight.
That's very nice of you.
I wish that had occurred to me.
Tom managed to get in the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
I saw the cat.
In Paris, snow falls.
I hope Tom will return safely.
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom's strict but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us were eating potato salad.
Come alone.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship has quickly turned into love.
Don't be a lesilebovic.
I eat a lot of meat.
Tom's a scumbag.
The future seems dark for Edmond Dantes, since he became the victim of the conspiracy, he was convicted to betray and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
My mother chose this curtain.
We're both not rich as much as we want.
Can you let Tom know I came in?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom's thinking the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
She's in the grave with one leg
Tom just told me the opposite.
Against the loudest!
I'm compassionate.
Tom's dissatisfied.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy like electricity.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at least.
How old are you really?
Tom asked me if I slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Nice to meet you.
This place looks a lot different than what it was before.
Why are the rabbit's ears big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how to do that.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Come see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to deal with in the walk.
This one's really cool.
I just enjoyed it.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Cade.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That's a lot of help.
What do you believe?
I'm sorry I tried at all.
That river looks tiny, isn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this composition.
We hate Tom.
This one's really cool.
Tom cut the tape.
This isn't that fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she'd find out all her bosses' secrets if they didn't increase her salary.
"Would you think?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please wait a minute.
I'm not gonna do that!
I'm tired of arguing.
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
She's a singer.
I like to watch you play.
I was definitely lucky.
What first song did you ever write?
Tom could screw himself up.
I just want to get away.
Don't let her get you out of this good chance.
Be careful.
He's in the first year of college.
I looked for grape juice.
I meant my family.
Can you make Tom laugh?
My liquid language knowledge is enough for many situations, but not to express my, often mutually contradictive, emotions.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbreaking.
Tom's on a secret mission.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of a snake.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I slipped once.
I'm sorry I'm always interrupting you.
He's a man of power.
That's wonderful!
I'm a goal.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird that the postman hasn't come yet.
How do we prevent that from happening?
I hope Tom will remember this.
Did I really be so happy?
I'll buy a boat soon.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
Did you ever get a fast ride punishment?
I'll be right upstairs.
We have to go.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There's no girlfriend on the Internet.
She tried.
As most of the 18-year-olds, Tom is not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of musical works for a fagot.
U.S. Secretary John Carrie broke his right butt bone in a bicycle accident on Sunday in France.
Where a lot of grandmothers, they're pounded kids.
Sounds simple, I know.
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were incredible.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes have screwed up.
Have you completely recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom was speaking very loud.
Don't move!
There was an accident recorded by the observer.
Did I drop it?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.
It's in vain.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the dest side is in New York.
There are indications that the reception, which is known by its luxury dishes, this year will be something more modest.
What about you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom will do that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Where are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
Violent criminals were often violent in childhood.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves the words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to me for dinner yesterday.
Look what he's like!
Live truth.
You're very inappropriate.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now it's a great time to buy that.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom got out of it.
Tom's been interfering with people who should never have been involved with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and write.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve yourself.
I've been exaggerating.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This should work.
You don't have to judge a man according to his appearance.
It's unconnected.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thank you for the e-mail!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll make speeches tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've been there before.
That's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
So what are your plans?
Kids are sleeping.
You need a temporary bridge.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
I didn't have fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Tom worked very hard and broke a lot of money.
I don't like being socialized.
He lived a simple life.
We offered help.
It was a dark and storm night.
The first phase is over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even a surplus.
We're glad to have you here.
Tom was sure of himself.
I wonder how Tom feels.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I bought dozens of pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Does French learn in your school?
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna recover.
You're important to me.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get into it.
I'm used to nobody likes me.
The brakes are scratching.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
I'm a little worried now.
Do you have a stable relationship with the boy?
Tom still knows he's saying the song he wrote when he was 13 years old.
Did you see Tom gone?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm ready to pay you well to do that.
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
Many of them admire him.
I hope it'll be a good time tomorrow.
Let's sit down.
Come and look at it.
Tom really seems familiar.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters that Mary sent to him.
Go swim with Tom.
He's safe.
Tom died in his dream.
The woman's shifner is not full without a small black dress.
Finish this.
Tom helped me save a dinar by telling me about a cheaper place where it could be bought.
There's nothing else to do but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
Tom will live.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I understood wrong.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really so happy?
I'm good with the kids.
I'm gonna be late.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the road.
You should leave Tom a message.
You always lie to me.
Just in time!
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?
As little as we know about her origin, at least we can be sure he's a pilot of Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom's on the bus.
The deer is faster than stronger.
People used to write books to knocking machines.
I reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Mary learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I hope not.
How could I hate Tom?
Wear this.
What a barbarian!

I wouldn't hurt her.
In this stage of world history, in America there is no one such thing as an independent press. You know that and I know that. There is no one among you who dares to write his sincere opinion, and if he would have written it, he would know ahead that it will never appear in the press. I get regularly my pay to keep my sincere opinion out of the newspaper for which I am working for. Many of you are also paid for similar things, and anyone of you who would be so crazy to write what he honestly thinks would find himself out outside, in looking for some other work. That I have let my right opinion appear only in one edition of the newspapers for which I work, I would get fired from work for less than 24 hours. The job of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie, to distort what he honestly thinks, to find himself out out outside, looking for some other jobs.

That's right.
Let's be friends.

I'm really happy about that.
We missed Tom so much.
I'm not ashamed of that.

He looks young for his age.
I'll always remember your advice.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.

So what if it's true?

I'll have to think about that,
Tom was talking about music.
There were so many people in the train that I had to stand.
I don't have homework today.
Tom and Mary agree well.
When can Tom come home?
In the window glass I see the reflection of my face.
Go talk to Tom.
I meant my family.
You could have spared me if you just told me I shouldn't even be here today.
This will make us much easier.
I've been gone too long.

Tell me where you live.
Let's go over it again.

I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a prize.
She's very patient.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Will we see Tom again?
Just try to stay calm.

Go ahead.
The first step is the hardest.
Mary read the whole instruction of 321 pages in the breath.

Can you take me home?
What do you have in mind?

It's clear.
Keep digging.
What are we doing with this mess?
Tom's confidence was broken when the boss took him off in front of his colleagues.
I'm not really worried.
We have a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that to me?
I'm probably not gonna watch this.
Come in.
Did I call you?
Most are afraid to set a great goal for themselves because of fear that they will never reach it.

Where are they going?
Does Tom know about this?
What should I tell them?
I can't sleep at all.
They couldn't go on like that in the second half-time.
Just give him some time.
How did I get here?
He's learning hard.
You need a lot of imagination when you're trying to add a new sentence here.

I checked.
Finish this.
He came to see you yesterday.
Tom's got a bad day.

Did the red rose blossom?
I'd like to leave.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Honour seeks to become reproach, which is the nearest sort of foolishness.
How long will Tom last?
The rain season starts June.
Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow?
I changed my schedule.
I'd like to know how to paint like that.

Shut up!
Tom says this is absurd.
I've never repented.

We'll never get back there.
It's been years.
They established the Joint Air Command where the director and head of the headquarters were respectively from the Navy and the Army.

It's chaos here.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Tell me what you wrote.
Tom left this morning without finishing his breakfast.
You don't even know his name, do you?
I'm sorry, Tom.
That's the situation of things that can't be tolerated.
We've never played football before.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
It's just a light.
When's the meeting?
I could go there now.
I'm stubborn.
Because of lies, he got in trouble when his boss found out the truth.
Looks good for her age.
I really love members of my team.
What did you both do?
We're in trouble now.
It seemed so delicious.
I have a stone in my shoe.
Can you give me a sign?
Tell me what I missed.
He asked me to help him.
Tom has a younger sister Mary.
I could have used that.
I was very excited.
Don't yell.
I didn't tell him you were here.
I saw Tom die.
You're in a better shape than I am.
How's that?
I'll try to find them.
I can lose my permission.
Tom told me what to do.
I know exactly what I have to do.
Tom's on a trip.
We'll let you know as soon as we find out.
She told me everything last night.
What can I do?
Did I really be so happy?
There's a gastrointestinal.
I can't resist anymore.
I could lose my retirement.
Tom knows knocking very fast.

Africa is a scaffold of humanity.
Tom has high moral standards.

We did everything we could.
We just need one chance.

I know I'm not perfect.
Mary sat on the grass, playing ukulele.
Before this decision gets into force, no one's going to move with a finger to solve this.
Do you have anything to report?
I always hated to do that.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known that Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Tom's gonna talk.
It wasn't easy for me.
He's accelerated.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't exaggerate.
Look at that.
I've got a habit to do that.
It's not the right choice.
It's all in the report.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
I met some beautiful people.
I had lunch with him.
Are you coming, Tom?
Try it.
Think about it again.
How's Tom at work?
That needs a doctor.
I want to be a man again someday.
Why is that so complicated?
What am I doing here?

Do you want to come in?
Maybe I'm missing something here.
Check around.

I'm free.
Three times five is fifteen.

Now I have to go.
How hard would it be to do that?
Find yourself a place.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
After she got in the lottery, she went out to a shopping game.
It's getting harder to concentrate.
Show me the pictures!
I think she's from Austria.
Please wait until I'm ready.
It's always like that.
I'm interested.
Again, please.
Can you talk to Tom about me?
Get Tom out of here.
Sleep a few hours.
What happened?
The Intelligence Satellite is able to monitor many activities on earth, listen to communication lines, register the working frequency of the radar systems...
I asked you last night.
You're very beautiful.
I doubt it will be hard for you to get a driver's license.

I thought I was stabbed.
I'm just thinking out loud.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Why would you tell Tom anything?
I could have used that.
I hope I can write two or three songs during the weekend.
You don't know me.
How are Tom and Mary?
It doesn't mean something's a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom will return safely.
I like what you wrote.
Don't be blind.
Where did you find this knife?
They need you to help them.
Do you have anything to report?
We want complete sentences.
Get your ass over here!
I'm not owned.
I sincerely hope that Tom's predictions will come true.
If we had arrived here earlier, maybe we could save Tom.
Why are you leaving?
The gold is in the green forests.
I'm afraid.
You met my sister, didn't you?
How many years have it been since I last saw you?
Tom's books were translated into many languages.
Who left the door open?

The air conditioning is broken.
I'm not like anyone else.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
Get out.
I thought you wouldn't want that.
Would you like more pire potatoes?
And then something amazing happened.
Such a project, of course, required the rebalance of the budget.
I'm not sure where Tom is.
I had no idea what to write.
I can write very fast.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Swimming makes your feet stronger.
I forgot to pay the rent.
I didn't do that either.
The guard's out front.
I'll be in my quarter.
We'll get over it again.

It's fun.
Girls like to play houses.

Did you wash the dishes?
Come closer.
Tom's not the real man for that job.
Tom took the kids to the park.
Please stop here.
Tom really looks familiar.
I'm just kidding you.
I'm not ready to go.
How can anyone sleep with all this distraction?
Tom could convince Mary to do that.
Did I really be so happy?
Are we safe now?
He made her happy.
What were you doing today?
How much do I get?
She was the only one who understood me.
You can't just eat one.
Be careful.
Dogs are smart.
I give you what you want.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'll leave early today.
How adventurous!
Tell me what that is.
Did you finish your homework?
Get out of here!
Who's knocking?
I'm really happy to be here.
Please don't yell.
Why are you acting childish?
We could only save Tom if we had arrived a few minutes earlier.
I know this is weird.
I'm glad we were there.
Do you have anything to say?
Why did you do that?
Tom was very nice.
I need to buy a new coat because my old man licked out.

Who has time for this?
I'm still asleep.
Tom's a dai-traider.

So what's your secret?
This one's pretty cool.
Just be quiet, please.
I don't understand what the teacher says.
Have a good week!
Doping is not compatible with my ideological views of sport.
I'm coming to save you!

That was awful.
I wasn't sure at all.
Never say never.
I took part in the competition.
Did you eat anything?
France is in Western Europe.
I hope Tom stays here.
The aircraft are landing on the airports.
That's all your wisdom!
Tom was wearing a black hat.
You did what you had to do.
Tom always looks unsatisfactory.
We're out of money.
I think they're all overreacting.
I'm very happy about that.
Tom turned around to leave.
I'll never mention this again.
Let me show you where to put that.
Why didn't you let Tommy talk to Mary?
Wake up at seven in the morning.
What would I do without you?
I think Tom will be able to help us overcome this.
I'm already paid.
They're all screwed up.
Did I call you?
Come on Tuesday, if possible.
We need to be realistic.
Don't look.
They accidentally heard some suspicious activity in the squirrel that indicates that the bear smelled their food.
I've been everywhere in Europe.
Can I help you, sir?
Don't look at it.
You asked for it yourself.
How's this your fault?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Come to my neighborhood.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm ruined.
Tom's in constant pain.
The other girls in Mary's department were ridiculous about her clothes.
Everyone's been through it or they're going through it.
I'll get on it right now.
I'm broken.
Tom and Mary enjoy walking along the path of pilgrimages in France.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these sentences to Chinese?
Have you watched?
Are you busy here?
I'm picking between two possibilities.
We have what we need.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Did you take a good look?
Tom asked me to wake him at half seven.
We didn't do it.
Did you wash the dishes?
Please, give me the sauce.
How does Tom work?
Be careful.
Do you have a paper I can write on?
He was walking the street.
Do you agree with that?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw the cat.
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of the Christmas Sale of Books, and it's hard to get some book out of position.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a rumor?
Did you wash the dishes?
Give me another reason.
Let's have a drink!
I assumed you were busy.
Are you disclexic?
I wish I just knew.
Change your clothes.
That's all I could find.
A great group of people gathered together.
I'm working on my project.
Everything is well prepared ahead.
I'm not counting on that.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
They gave water to their horses.
I'll give you everything you want.
Girls were wearing grass skirts and they had flowers around their neck.

No one trusted her.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was pretty fine.
This sad story was written when Tom was in exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
I'm sure I'm gonna win that tennis match.
Do you have anything to say?
Get changed.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if your wife left you?
Can you prove that?
I'm sorry.
It's easy to write with this pen.
Are you ready for more?
This pen's not working.
Did you see me dance?
I'd rather not be involved in that at this moment.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play a guitar.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That likes both of them.
It must have been horrible.
I'll borrow you a workbox if you promise me you won't write anything on it.
My friends live in the same house as I do.
There's a lot of bad people in the world.

Are they in love?
Where do we meet tomorrow?
Tom saved Mary.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think they're all ready.
You'll see her.

Did you eat anything?
Let's make it clear.
Stiglić is a very interesting bird.
The connection between the personality and the blood group is not scientifically confirmed.

Are you coming soon?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
The working group dealing with data transfers, managed by Ben Manny, will hold a meeting on January 14, 1999.
Some say if you get on the rainbow, it'll start raining.
At my beginning, it's my end.
I just arrived.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
What should I see?
Did you decide what you're going to do?
Tom knows knocking very fast.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
I'm saving to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give up just like that.
I give you what you want.
Who did you write a letter to?
Maybe I'll need some help.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm more creepy than I look.
No one's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train.
I'm not gonna be home next week.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be okay.
What do you call it?
How does Tom know French?
I like to watch you work.
Answer me now.
There's no politics established.
Write what I say.
The rain's finally stopping.
I live in an old house.
Do you love your mother?
It was a big explosion.
Tom blinked.
I didn't walk out today.
Did they tell you the reason?
Can you spell my name?
Look at this.
She was saving her head alive.
I think we should call the doctor.
You're so early today.
We caught Tom at work.
We need to be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't satisfied with the results.
I hid under the table.
They're holding me hostage.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom asked Mary how she liked the new job.
I'm a big football fan.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary's making money for life sewing.
Can you give me some water, please?
Where's your friend?
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it at all.
Tom's used to winning.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
We're here for you.
I'm intrigued.
What do you want?
The medicinal products should not be mixed mostly with alcohol.
Did you see who that was?
When I woke up, snow fell.
Some people, no matter how old they are, don't lose their beauty.
I've played golf with Tom a lot of times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's pretty extraordinary.
It'll happen bad things.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get in there.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Explore her.
She was dressed in red.
What is the Sovietologist studying?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Have you completely recovered?

Keep working.
Hope gets lost when you experience a difficult situation and a senseless brake.
I was laughing.
The new constitution will not solve Egypt's problems.
Solar energy is a clear source of energy.
It seemed to me that Tom didn't do what he was supposed to do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dancing?
Did you eat anything?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
Is it clean?
They haven't wake up yet.
Everything's free.
Welcome.
We don't have a choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He keeps losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
I'm thinking about going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are the Americans really so individual?
You can go play with your friends when you're done cleaning up the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
What's your specialization?
I'm double older than Tom.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't influence it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot of things.
I wasn't too surprised.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've never been camping.
There's a lot of unfair people in the world.
Don't yell.
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
Hungarian language is not easy, but it's beautiful.
I think so, too.
I prefer a tent with a storm cover, along with the crossed sticks for stability on the wind and the snow inflammation, and this has to be a two-style tent.
Tell Tom I'll say hello.
I can't be something I'm not.
Where are we going to meet?
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do that.
I'm touched.
Tom's fired.
Do you plan to go to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
This candidate is significantly better than his precedent.
Don't call me while I'm in the office.
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor's interrogating the patient.
Tom put his drinks down.
It's a lyrics of justice.
I could lose my retirement.
She's in a bad mood.
I always knew that.
Don't beat.
Every communication is a translation.
I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about that.
I've never been to camping.
They believe in God.
Everyone's the boss in his own house.
Let's hope you're right.
We broke up on the corner.
Are you angry about that?
I baked my tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could trust Tom.
When there's no news, that's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did that come up with me?
Did you sleep?
They've been judging hard in court.
Is there a reason why you're keeping these old bottles?
We've been talking for a while.
Now I have to go.
Can I take your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That fabric isn't from India, is it?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
Maybe I'm anti-social, but that doesn't mean I'm not talking to people.
I believe you're honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started learning French last year.
Tom was sitting on the bench all day writing cards.
Don't you eat anything?
It's abandoned.
Don't move!
I've already thought about it.
Money's talking.
I hope Tom will remember this.
Tom told me his father died.
We have to spend less!
I parked twice.
I've never noticed that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Tom broke something again.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
I love this store.
I'm just about to go looking for you.
He's leading a hard life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom's got the right attitude.
The anatomic breast implants, however, can also lead to the deformation of breast forms if they rotate on the side.
Where did you find the keys?
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little freaked out.
I saw the bus.
Tom's wise enough to do something like that.
I brought these reports to see them more closely.
I'm not as rich as we would like.
Get on the board.
Tom's still mad.
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Mary wear a coat.
Have fun while you can.

It's useless.
What planet are you from?

Am I in love?
Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat anything?
Give me another reason.
What did you two do?
Is this your first exam?
Life's going on!
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Okay, we have a deal.
Let's not be emotional.
Tom is very patient.
Everything's changing.
Tom knows where the wind blows.
Women are the most beautiful in the man's life.
When you get your phone, the battery's overloaded.
Tom knows that now.
I volunteered.
Shut up!
Tom likes that most.
Tom's driving me crazy.
This famous actress was also a fashion icon.
I'm not moving to Boston.
I'm impatient.
I finished my esperant study yesterday in Duoling.
Tom attacked Mary's sister.
Am I safe now?
We'll get to work right now.
I did what I could for him.

Are you allergic to some food?
They listen to Tom because he's persuasive.
My suitcase hasn't been packed yet.
Did you sleep?
Readers were on torture, waiting for at least three months before they got the answer.
Do you know someone who passed the exam last year?
Mary took her off for a trip.
They live on a high leg.
Tom got out of the limo.
I'm sure I've seen that guy somewhere before.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
You don't really support me.
What's he drinking?
You'll see her.
He's everything, just not fair.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
The police asked the criminal to surrender his gun.
It's human to sin. Forgiving is divine.

It just took me a while.
I have to go.
Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
What's that?
Man snows, God determines.
Tom was wearing black farmers.
It must have been fun.
What do you have to say?
That gives me an idea.
Did you just meet them?
It's more art than science.

It was just like that.
Add more water.
Tom's counting the remnant.
All parking spots are full.
This is my brother, Tom.

Tom's still a woman.
You're getting unreasonable.
No, don't do that.
I had a dog when I was a kid.
Tom was with his girlfriend, but he couldn't see who he was.
I won't ask Tom to do that.
Everyone was standing.
I was pretending I didn't understand.
Would you talk to Tom?
Can you give me the remote?
Why are you leaving?
Now it's time to enjoy.
Did he fulfill his goals?
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Have you seen my dogs?
I have a book.
What are your kids usually breakfast?
Am I so different?
We had a terrible fight.
Tom's a salesman, too.
I'm double older than Tom.

Tell Tom I'm ready.
I'll apologize.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
Tom wants to pay off the money he owes.
All things have to go through.
Come on in the truck.
I've never seen that before.
I don't have a desire for that.
I think Tom was great.
I've got a headache.
Tom looks a little gross.
I loved my wife cooking.
I'm proud of my family.
Men have approximately 7 to 8 times more testosterone than women.
I have to go.
It was a good hat.
The door's stuck for something.
Tom's gone right away.
I had lunch with her.
You taught me so much.
What's bigger, the sun or the Earth?
We'll get you one.
No doubt!
Looks like you've lost ten pounds.
You disappointed me.
We'll get on it right now.
May I ask why?
I bought this yesterday.
You did a great job.
The security guard's burned.
Are we safe now?

Anyway, what's your address?
This one's uncomfortable.

Tom could have something to do with it.

It doesn't work on me.
The congregation is dismissed.
Tell me what you wrote.

That's all I needed.
Let me try.
I paid for it.
I bought a new hat in the store.
I wouldn't hurt him.
I have complete confidence in you.
Have you ever listened to such a good music?
It's okay.
I think you'll be able to do that.
Stop it, will you?
He threw the ball in the naked!
It's a big day, son!
We were filled with joyful expectations.
It's just a personal attitude.
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Did you tell Tom this?
My older sister is very talented to sing.
I'll forgive you, but I won't forget.
I always thought it was weird.
Clear your lips with a salvet.

The keys are in the code.
That's all we can do.
Is that your new shoes?
What's the name?
Why don't you take your coat off?
Where the hell have you been before?
She was smiling.
Tom just couldn't do that.
I thought you were married.
I'll go if you go.
Well, I have some news.
The chances were against me.
I want to be with her.
What I saw was embarrassing.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
You tried.
Thank you for loving me.
I'm a big football fan.
You're making Tom nervous.
Keep working.
There's a lot of bad people in the world.
I thought you were happy here.

Can you solve this problem?
Some of my friends smoke.

Tom's gonna wait.
Looks like Tom thinks so.
Don't let Tommy sleep.
Come down here.
Excuse me?
Everyone's changing.
Would you like more apple juice?
We can't lose hope.
Let's sit down.
Buy a liter of milk, and if they have eggs, buy twelve eggs.

I'm hurt.
Keep digging.
I don't want any evil.

Comments must be about the subject.
Don't get out of here.
The programme sets the conditions for the development and implementation of projects.

What are we doing with this mess?
Tom counted the remnant.
I was studying hard while I was at school.
I refused the Tom.
Should we tell someone?
After five hours on the hot sand, he saw something on the horizon that looked like a desert fatamorgan.
When are you coming to the station?
Are you honest?
We'll try in your way.
Are you a maniac?
I'll be better now.
And that's it!
I made an apple pie.
Are you a prisoner?
No one's watched.
If you have to be somewhere right now, it's definitely here!
Tom could lie.
Good luck.
I've never repented for that.
Tom was mad as a ris.
Tom could have a point.
Am I welcome here?
What did you both do?
Don't yell.
What a experience!
Tom's learning to program.
Are we done?
Tom's a little eccentric.
Mary came back from school in tears because her friends were kidding her.
I trusted you my secret and you betrayed me.

Maybe you're wrong.
I'm sure you'll understand.
I have to pay my debt.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
His speech was, mildly said, a disaster.
We have to save money to buy a new car.
Bad things will happen.

What year is your car?
You have to believe it's possible that it's gonna change.
She translated her sentence.
Did you ever ask Tom to use it?
I could go there now.
Everyone was cheering.
Tom said you were cool.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive carefully.
Let's see.

He's making such a grimas to wish you hit him.
Be careful.
You understand me.

Tom arrived in time despite the storm.
Something wasn't right.
Tom said I was unkind.
Tom wanted to get Mary's phone number, but she refused to give it to him.
I'm beaching someone to do it for me.
You're still inexperienced.
We'll have a great time.
It's not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's so hot here.
Have you completely recovered?
Tom was wearing black farmers and a white shirt.
The book cost five bucks.
Is it so simple?
Tom's not like the other guys.
Listen to this.
How much is that worth?
I was lucky to survive the accident.
No one I know is going there anymore because it's a big crowd.
I'm teaching Korean.
I'm losing.
I don't want to see him again.
I'm glad Tom left.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
You're driving slowly.
Tom must have had the key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I'm here for.
Tom probably hates me, too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray cats, please don't pass.
Just give me a chance.
What makes you smile?
How many people were there?
Everyone's quiet.
Send me some sugar, please.
I'm amazed.
I want the sword!
Don't talk.
Excellent!
I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom broke into Harvard.
Tom had a little help.
Tom was more than ready.
I'm not thinking about it.
You're average students.
Tom's as old as Mary.
Why don't you come by sometime?
We all did that.
What have you done now?
Answer me now.
Why are you mad at me?
Don't forget we should do our homework.
It would be nice to wait for me.
They were sitting in the circle.
I want to meet Tom.
We've arrived in time.
Norwegian prisons are the most luxurious in the world.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
It happened.
You need a hobby.
Keep working.

We need to get another bottle of wine.
Where did you find this knife?
The news came like a thunder from the edge of the sky.
Now I have to go.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'm not married to Tom.
It was a little weird.
What does this word mean?
I'm bluffing.
Tom promises Scotts Hills and Valleys.
I'm not sure when Tom will be here.
It's not related.
Tom used to be afraid of dogs.
Finally, we have all the names of the fields in Norwegian and that will be of great help to our users.
Tom's gonna talk.
I want to see you!
It's on your left side.
Where's the bathroom?
That doesn't look like you.
I'll call her tonight.
This will make our job much easier.
Tom intervened among people who had a very bad influence on him.
Where did I leave the keys?
I got 100 points on the mathematics test.
Am I in love?

Maybe Tom will agree to do that.

It's a big day, son!
Tell me what you wrote.
Keep an eye on him.
Be home by half seven.
That's not all we have.
Stay where you are, Tom.
I recommend that you visit the British War Museum in London.
He got a cat's lucky colleague for his birthday.

That's a fake, isn't it?
Thank you.
I can't just surrender.
Do you like it or not?
Life continues!
"Do you like costumes?" "I hate costumes!"
I liked that one.
It must be scary.
Men want to feel significant.
Can we just start over?
Do you know what this sentence means?
Looks like she lives in Britain.
But-but is an example of the ideophone.
You're paying me well.
Tom said all right.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
Tom opened a new restaurant, but he couldn't earn from it for the first 12 months.
Tom's right this time.
You're losing.
Lots of things have happened.
Bergen is the second largest city in Norway.
I'm quitting.
What's on your mind?
I gave them an anniversary present.
This isn't drinking water.
Tom showed me how to read.
Did I really be so happy?
Does it make sense to me?
That's how I figured it out.
Tom wrote several hundred articles and several books.
Come on.
What do you mean by that?
Tom wrote Mary's phone number.
There's a good chance we're gonna win.
The meeting took an hour.
I can walk only about three miles.
You told me not to lie.
Tom was a garbage.
Beer's good.

We will live like kings.
I didn't write this.
I'm not ready to go.
You have to stay with me.
I'm glad you answered.

Does Tom have any experience?
That's really beautiful.
Both of my sisters are teachers.

I made a complete fool of myself.
I've been there before.
I'm mad at Tom.
Can you give me the remote?
Her name was Mary.
Tom was probably born in Australia.
Tom's out of the way.
If you don't understand, you have to say that.
My parents died.
It's really nice.
I'll yell.
Don't cheat.
You're the other one!
Tom broke something again.
It's not that simple.
Do you want to keep it?
We'll take the next one.
I don't need instructions.
Go upstairs.
That doesn't matter.
I'll teach you how to write.
Mile depends on the conditions on the road.
Don't fight.
What have you done now?
The sun shineed, but it was cold.
Maybe it's not possible.
Tom will remember.
Tom could lose himself.
He asked me to help him.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.

Would you rather tea?
What's the longest river in the world?
Just stay away from this.

The plastic glass is better than the one made of the right glass.
I was laughing.
Just give Tom a second.
I gave them an anniversary present.
I saw Tom play many times.
Everybody tells me I'm weird.
I'll take a rice for my collage.
I'm very proud of it.
What did you say to Tom?
We strongly recommend that you use one of the three advanced regimes to achieve optimum results.
That's encouraging news.
You shouldn't go out now.
I didn't have fun, so I went home early.
Have you ever written a computer program?
Such projects never end.
I prefer orange apples.
Here's a secret.
Could it be true?
Don't let him get in your head.
I really want to find something to eat.
What's your age?
You're absolutely right.
I apologize to those among you who are eventually offended; that was not my intention.
I told you it'd work.
I'm tired.
Nothing can stop me.
Criminals should be punished.
Who knows what that was?
It's been a long time.
Tom seems a little nasty.
I shot a bear.
I was looking for you.
Tom's been severely beaten.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote myself.
You didn't commit a serious offence.
I don't like writing.
You're asking me questions you already know the answers.
I didn't see anything.
We get a few men mad at Tom at the bar and Tom told them he wasn't afraid to face them.
Did Tom really want Mary to do that?
Tom failed to present any evidence that would support his statement.
I'm not that happy.
Anybody want a beer?
If something sounds too good to be true, it's probably true.
I'm not gonna say anything.
You're good to everyone.
Come see me after work.
How do I call a cab?
Tom signed Mary as a waiter.
Open up.
Tom is very sophisticated.
When you start, you'll never stop.
That's really nice.
I can't either.
Do you like rollers?
If it's not okay, it's not the end.
Move, people.
Are you sarcastic?
Where did you find this knife?
Speak for yourself, Tom.
We shouldn't laugh at others.
Have you completely recovered?
I'm proud of it.
Where did I put my keys?
There's obvious difference between the good and the best.
I don't sing.
Am I ever wrong?
Take care of your business!
She licked the spoon.
What did you conclude?
We know that's not true.
We're all gonna die.
Tom has two children.
Is that far from here?
I'm very happy about that.
Tom had no choice but to smile and endure.
The cigarettes cost two Marks.
I know I'm not perfect.
This is how it was supposed to be.
Tom was nervous about you.
What's wrong with you?
We haven't met yet.
I'm not old.
Can I take your dictionary?
Tom himself ate the whole box of chocolate.
Can we do this later?
The truth must be said.
Do you like costumes?
Didn't you do enough?
What do you know about me?
I think he's very smart with that.
Does that mean you love me?
This will never end.
We have a serious problem.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Explain it in simple words.
Tom just drinks coffee without caffeine.
Tom pulled the plunger out of the bottle.
We need to get another bottle of wine.
Now we need the truth.
Tom's sleeping all the time.
I really like your music.
This is Kopakabana!
I'm learning a few languages.
When you hurt others, you hurt yourself.
You're dead.
You can't make us leave.
Tom said I could stay.
Who else uses this room?
You'll save time if you listen carefully to my instructions.
He's tired of reading.
Can we order now?
We can't stop here.
Tom didn't think for a moment he was trying to convince Mary to do that.
Hey, give me a chance.
There is also an ethical question that has been asked about this.
It just happened again.
Everyone survived.
It'll happen bad things.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of it.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I'm totally disagree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than I do.
I don't have anything on my hand today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
I need my children.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn't read because it was too little.
I didn't wash my hair.
Are you hungry?
Tom's still frustrated.
If you try, you'll make it.
We have enough seats for everyone.
That was a fake alarm.
Tom's learning programming.
Everybody can get the waxes.
Tom didn't let me answer Mary's question.
Every time I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
I want Tom to go by noon.
Tom seemed amazed.
Tom wasn't very energy.
It won't help you if you're worried.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Did you go see Tom?
I was looking for you.
I'll go with the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know which question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm taking a day off.
Are you blaming me?
That ruined the mood at the table yesterday.
I thought you were going to Boston bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Just waste your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs do you have?
I've never had trouble sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll figure something out.
A honest man can't do that.
Take care of yourself!
I won't try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this time?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything settled now?
Please send me the doctor's account.
What's this about?
Have a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new in this.
I improvised.
"Do you know what's going on?" "No, what's the matter?"
That likes both of them.
You and I need to talk.
You spyed on me.
The pen that I write belongs to Tom.
Where did you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We're helping each other.
Tom and Mary remained good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom suffocated his smile.
I'm afraid.
What name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom was the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's going.
I didn't spend anything.
It's a area with a lot of new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom seemed pretty nervous.
Tom likes sports.
Tom took off his wig.
It seemed like I was right.
Her name was unknown.
I'll get Tom ready.
Stay away from my girlfriend.
I'm sorry I tried at all.
I'm not really upset at all.
Jumi is one of my friends.
It just took him a while.
I thought you wouldn't do that.
Sorry I'm so late.
Maria started taking off.
It's up and down.
Life without love doesn't make any sense.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
I'm strong against this.
You underestimate me.
Tom almost never makes mistakes when he writes French.
The police didn't reject the possibility of suicide.
This was on the list.
She dreamed of being a nurse.
Come here, young man.
This should work.
The hard work was worth it.
Tom asked me if she should help Mary or not.
I was just thinking about you.
Signal lamps are used to transmit Morse's alphabet.
It's not going far away from Main Street, but there you can get number 31.
The worst is just coming.
I was home last night.
Men talk about women all the time.
Many people already hate you.
If I knew your e-mail address, I would have written to you.
Tom could beat anyone.
I'm trying the best I can do here.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
The government has fallen down.
Tom had a wine swallow.
This will take forever.
I'm so excited.
I'm here to play baseball.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Don't stop.
Close the window.
Tom missed the target.
I disagree with you completely.
Relax.
Let me say that again.
They live there.
This book will help you write effectively.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I work in Milan.
Come back in a day.
It had a lot different effect than the intention.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
Everybody laughs.
I liked going to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It's all over.
The book's sold out.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That needs the truth.
I liked going to the beach.
At first, it looks easy.
It's time to say goodbye.
You should've been my friend!
People should stop hatred.
I don't doubt he'll succeed.
I never advised you to do that.
I don't intend to change.
Tom launched the car.
My grandmother enjoys the tea ceremony.
She smiled.
They've deceived everything.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it a secret.
We went to school together.
We're doing this wrong.
We'll get you one.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
In accordance with our rules, all participants must show legitimacy, registered papers and license in the inspection.

How does that work out?

They decided to get married.
What's Tom drinking?
Practice has a lot of use.
That's what the scholars are arguing about.
He's trying.
Tom told me his father died.
Tom told me I should stay home.
It's too loud for me here.
I want to be more cute.
Tom has a strong German accent.
Tom asked Mary to scratch him on a part of his back that he couldn't reach.
It's over there.
I was pretending I didn't know what was going on.
Just stay with me.
I forgot to write a name on the exam.
Does Tom have the key?
Tom's ready.
You always do.
There are situations in chess that are worth sacrifice of a figure to acquire a long-term advantage.
Young kids should learn to feel compassionate to animals.
You're not done yet?
You're not the one who died.
It's hard to imagine.
Are you sarcastic?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
She's walking.
My mother likes music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Draw a drawing of your house.
Tom put down his drinks.
I'm pretty shocked with this.
The spice is empty.
Tom decided to go against.
I'm grateful.
I couldn't do this without your help.
Don't answer.
If you did that for me, it would be very helpful.
He was a naked breast and a boss.
Tom might be honest.
Can you explain how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
I'm a little worried now.
What's in there, Tom?
Get yourself out of here.
I'm totally out of money.
Tom hates Mary.
Can I borrow your pen for a while?
Don't let him get in your head.
My right hand shoved.
Well, that's enough!
I'm selling coffee.
Tom used to work with me once.
Stop it!
Tom jumped into the water and didn't take off his clothes.
I'm a little crazy.
I'd be happy to agree.
Every bird is flying to his own yoke.
Do you want to see the total darkness of the sun that will leave Svalbard in the dark 20th March 2015?
I'm sleeping firmly.
Have you eaten anything?
Emma was very impressive at the party.
What did you just write in the briefcase?
I know it's illegal.
I've been studying hard when I was at school.
They wanted to punish me.
Don't talk.
You look fat.
Do you live there?
I'm kidding.
Why am I here?
They're different as heaven and the earth.
Tom was totally alone.
The cavalry's here.
Everybody's asleep.
Tom begged Mary not to tell his parents anything.
Would you like to come with me?
Tom's family lives in Boston.
I liked that one.
Al lived in the Soviet Alliance, the great and multinational, in the large Tver region, at the size of a few English countries.
Tom can be dangerous.
Are these your bags?
What did you do to me?
Don't jump!
When he was six years old, he learned to knock on a writing machine, and he told the teacher that he shouldn't learn to write with his hand.
I was practicing.
That doesn't sound very convincing, but I trust you.
I think I'll go out and eat.
Can we talk outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I was a good act.
Am I safe now?
Please write.
We didn't have this plan for you.
Tom's selling cars.
He started screaming.
Tom was apparently shaken.
Did you see who that was?
I didn't know you were so rich.
I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We kissed last night.
Was I really so happy?
Tom never had to do that.
You don't hear often someone bought a hat for a thousand dollars.
Come here.
That's what I'm used to.
Do you doubt me?
Tom's been working his whole life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what he likes both of them.
There's something coming up.
Help, police, help!
I already ordered it.
I'm sure Tom's gonna miss me so much.
What's your name?
Where did you get that?
Tom's a really nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this disturbance.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Swimming is a kind of exercise.
The government fell after the vote in parliament.
I want to be a swimmer.
Shall we see Tom again?
When did you have time to do that?
I don't have a lot of friends.
We don't know what brings tomorrow.
What first instrument did you learn to play?
I'm amazed.
There's nothing left.
Have you ever written a computer program?
I'm not losing hope.
I have a plan.
You took my place.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
Do you think Tom would like to come with us to camp next weekend?
Did you decide what you're going to do?
Drive carefully.
Did I ask you?
How long has Tom stayed?
People tell me things.
Get on the hell out of here!
Tom's in his pajamas.
Did Tom believe your story?
I was very tired so I went to sleep early.
It's hard.
Tom thought I was lying.
I don't want anything from you.
How's it going?
Don't argue with me.
Tom is also a seller.
I want to feel important.
We'd give anything to avoid that happen.
I think Tom needs help.
Switzerland needs better apples.
Are you involved in this?
Everybody stands.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
You can never get the shit gold so it doesn't smell.
Don't rush.
No one can know everything.
I'm objective.
I'll leave early today.
Are my red ears?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many tools do you know how to play?
The employees can be motivated by good, fair salary, a chance to work in a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuss and chances of progress.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed it.
That's encouraging news.
Give me some sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get a driver's license.
Did you manage to do it alone?
Is everything settled now?
How can it be that mathematics, which is still only a product of human thought independent of experience, are so impressively adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
Looks like Tom is an honest person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I had a quick lunch.
He risked it.
His wife wrapped his shirt.
Someone told me about it.
Swallow pride!
To change the red meat, I cooked turkey breasts in a mushroom sauce for tonight.
I'm always creepy.
Tom's fighting like crazy.
I always liked horror movies.
Something just came up.
I couldn't stop crying.
You've grown up.
They're not mine.
I double the prices.
Could you do that?
A video of interviews was made and published across the Internet.
Tom was drunk and drowned his sadness, after that one night of drunk.
Why don't we take a little rest?
Go check it out.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Do you think so?
I didn't even do that.
Do you have anything to report?
I say that all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I just got there.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why?
Tom dropped a drowned breath.
There's a lot to do before I can go home.
By the way, where do you live?
Do you have any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when you speak fast.
It'll be half three soon.
They'll know.
Tom bought a few black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
Cirich is considered one of the major financial centres.
That's very rare.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just not in a hurry.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not get out of here.
It's not getting worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a hard job.
I'm happy we won.
You can't go into that room.
"Do you feel better?" "No, I'm worse."
It's all passive, but the nice memories are alive.
I was in the mountains.
It's hard.
What's easier?
Did you wash the dishes?
We argued a lot.
It was a drop that poured the glass.
He doesn't like us.
We'd save time if we had gone down Park Street.
The cop arrested him for driving drunk.
We're going to be crazy.
That would be great.
The knife's not sharp.
We hope people like it.
We all have a price.
That gave him an idea.
I'm lucky.
No one knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks something's wrong with some politicians.
Where's Teheran?
Get over any obstacle with this truck monster!
Mary spends a lot of time on her phone sending messages and emails to her friends.
He always wears dark clothes.
Lucky was on our side.
Tom's working for his father's company.
I want to help you.
We never lose hope.
Men stay children all their life.
Now we need the truth.
I should be here all afternoon.
Didn't I teach you anything?
Why do you ask?
It's big.
What's fast, it's too short.
Come sit next to me.
I found his book.
I barely managed to hide my anger for her anger.
Butter's made of milk.
There's nothing we can do about that.
It's getting better.
Do you want to see something specific?
I miss him.
I've passed my exam!
Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please don't yell.
Does he still have a temperature?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
What did you do to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still a little tired.
We can't go back.
We'll visit you from time to time.
Tom had no courage to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand in the wrong way.
Are we meeting tonight?
