The members of the Wales National Assembly are concerned that “they look like maps ”
Some of the members of the congregation are surprised by their proposal to change their name in the MWP (Article of the Welsh Parliament).
This comes from plans to change the name of the congregation to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the congregation of the entire political scope are concerned that this may be a matter of ridicule.
One member of the congregation from the Laburist Party said his party is concerned that "remembling with Twp and Pwp."
For those who don't speak welsh: Welsh twp means "bullshit/fool," and pwp means "hoo".
Plaid's member said the party was completely "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Conservative Party said the works of his party are "free" for the change of the name, but he noted that the similarity of the words of the MWP and the "mapet" (ang. Muppet) is large.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is spoken similarly with the Yorkshire-English excuse of the letter "u".
The Commission of the People's Assembly, which is currently preparing the law to introduce name changes, said: "The final decision of any words to be appointed by the members of the congregation will, of course, bring them themselves."
Wells' government law since 2017 has given the power to the Wells congregation to change his name.
In June, the committee announced the results of public consultations on proposals indicating great support for the appointment of the congregation as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the name of the members of the congregation, the Commission prefers members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest support from public consultations.
Members of Parliament propose alternative options, but the struggle to achieve consensus can cause headaches to the President of the Assembly, Ellen Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes on the way the congregation works, including the rules for disqualification of members of the congregation and the design of the committee system.
Members of the congregation will give the final vote on the issue of their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
The voters will vote on Sunday about whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was set in an attempt to address the decade dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens insisted for a long time that the name of her north neighbour is the right to place its territory and has constantly opposed the efforts of the country to join in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite to change the name, said he would not take into account the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the change of name is simply a price to pay for EU and NATO entry.
St. Martin’s bell silent while the churches in Harlem face problems
"History, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"None of the others are gone today."
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
"The people socialize themselves in another way today," he said.
"The bars are no longer living rooms in the settlements where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, will return to the same place they started."
The churches, he added, can be replaced by housing buildings full of people who will not help the remaining sanctuary in the neighborhood.
"The largest part of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white," he said, "and that will accelerate the day when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that most people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolitan metropolitan in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white methodists moved out in the 30s.
The congregation of blacks who practice their faith nearby takes over the property of the building.
St. Martin was taken by the congregation of blacks during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boyco of 125 sellers, the Street, the main trading street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was very damaged in the fire in 1939, but since Father Johnson's parish members had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carilon.
The priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and heir in St. Martin, proudly called the carilon "the ring of the poor."
The expert who played on the carilon in July called it "cultural treasure" and "insequent historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first carilon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who transferred to the larger carilon to the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mariveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What was happening in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part of the inexperienced leaders of the church, and part of the episcopic eryphy.
The church committee - the church leadership, composed of non-explosive leaders - wrote to the eparchy in July with concern that the eparchy will "require to transfer costs" to the church board, although the church committee was not involved in the employment of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the eparchy.
Some of the parish members complained of the lack of transparency by the eparchy.
A shark hurt a 13-year-old kid in the lobster diving in California
The shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while the lobster dive in California, on the day of the opening of the lobster season, the authorized authorities said.
The attack happened something seven o'clock ago near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told about the KSWB TV in San Diego that he dived with his friends about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shouting for help and then wearing to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel stated that he first thought it was an excitement of grabing a lobster, but then “he realized that he cried,“ He bit me! ”
You bit me!'
The whole key bone was seen," Hamel said he noticed since he reached the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!" Hamel added.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the child's hospital Radio in San Diego, being seduced as a critical state.
There's no idea what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach Savior, Captain Larry Gils, said at the press conference that a few weeks earlier a shark in the area was observed, but they decided that the shark was not a dangerous species.
Gils added that the victim got traumatic injuries in the top of the torzo.
Authorized authorities closed the beach from the beach of Ponto in Casablad to Swami in Encinitas 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Gils noticed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's takes boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty sheets in the style of goods houses full of professional assistants.
As part of the substantial entry of beauty market in the United Kingdom, which weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow while selling in the fashion and household area declines, the large beauty potatoes will be tested in 11 shops everywhere in the country and will be presented in several shops next year if they show their success.
The beauty investment appeared after supermarkets began to seek ways to use the police space used for television, microwave ovens, and household equipment.
Sainsbury's said that for the first time they would double the offer of beauty to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, Mordalline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in boots stores.
The supermarket also restarts its makeup series of Boutique, so most of the products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly required from younger consumers.
Furthermore, Fragrance Shop's perfume trader will test concessions in two Sainsbury shops, from which the first opened in Craydon, South London, last week, and the second opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the trend of buying smaller foods on a daily basis in local shops means that supermarkets should do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, Sainsbury's director, said shops would look more like store houses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl's disconda with more services and products that are not food.
Sainsbury's began to put Argos' shops in hundreds of shops, and also introduced numerous Habitat shops after buying both chains two years ago, which, according to them, increased the sale of groceries and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and farming departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint activity with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after disagreement on the way of dividing the profits from chemical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy appeared after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its Celesio pharmaceutical shops, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury brands to the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hix, Sainsbury's Commercial Director, said: “We have transformed our appearance and feeling of beauty of our police to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues that will be available to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and the appropriate locations mean that we are now a duty destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "free" since Holly Willowby retired from an agreement worth 11 million pounds
Star Peter Jones of Dragons Den left "anger" after TV leader Holly Willowby retired from an agreement worth 11 million pounds with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby has no time for their brand Truly for products and household supplements.
The couple's business is connected to the Goop Brand of Guinet Palmrow.
This 37-year-old leader of the morning program said to Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willowby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, retiring from their profitable branded lifestyle business at the last moment to focus on her new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say Jones was "anger" when the TV gold girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlov, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- mean she no longer has time to devote to their Truly brand for products and household supplements.
The business is linked to the Goop Brand of Guinet Paltrou and said it would double Willowby's wealth estimated by 11 million pounds.
As 37-year-old Willowby told Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain at one of his houses.
One source said: “Truly was always at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was her long - term future that she would send in the next two decades.
Her decision to retire all affected are absolutely unwaited.
No one could believe what was going on Tuesday, was so close to the opening.
In Marlow's headquarters, there's a store full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving this morning programme leader, one of Britain's most paid stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in pillows and clergy products, and to clothes and household products and due to the potential for further delay.
And that may also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, mother of three children, and husband Dan Boldwin are close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willowby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
Twos go to vacation together and Jones has 40% of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willowby should become an ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebryty (I am the star) of ITV.
The source near Jones said yesterday "We do not comment on his business moves."
Seriously talking “And then we fell in love ”
He was joking about the criticisms he would get from the media for commenting that some would consider as "unpresident" and because he was so positive to the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Tramp give up so many things?
Tramp said with his voice converted as "present of news".
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in the second meeting since Tramp evaluated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the top diplomat of North Korea Rie Yong Ho said to the world leaders of the UN Main Assembly that the North has not seen "suitable response" from the United States for early North Korean disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressures.
Tramp takes a much more optimistic view in his talk on the event.
"We agree greatly with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results – the missile samples finished, helped release hostages, and the remaining US soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach when he talked about relations with Kim.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this full arena, we will have 200 people standing right here," Tramp said, pointing towards the crowd before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
As a result of the earthquake in Lombock, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lomboc's population has been allocated, there was no elementary accident, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, they were very clear that they were not looking for international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr. Sumbung said.
Although "Save Children" comprises a team traveling to Palu, it is still uncertain that foreign personnel can work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, speaker of the national disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies are allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Because of the earthquakes constantly affecting Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for nature’s anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common view in other coasts.
The apparent lack of siren to warn tsunami in Palu, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At the best time, traveling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
The hospital ship stationed in Lomboc for the treatment of the earthquake victims was heading towards Palu, but it would take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
The main point in the election campaign of President Yoko Vidodo was the improvement of Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of the re-elections next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectaic tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using cats, arrows, and other old weapons.

He transferred the ball on the left before he directed it to the distant article.
The ball was moving high above the sixteen while he was turning to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally went through the jumped Capa Arizabalaga and fell into the network.
"He was just trying to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shak always give as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible," Staridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cante approaching and I just touched her, and I didn't think much about it, and I was just kicking."
Chelsea took 1 - 0 in half time after the Belgian star One Hasard gave a naked in 25 minutes.
The "Blue" attacker passed five back to Mateo Kovačić in that attack before throwing the ball up to half the ground, and then sprinted into the half of Liverpool.
They quickly passed with Kovačić in the middle of the field.
He then pointed the missile, leading Hazzard to the sixteen.
Hazard passed the defense and finished the network of the remote article with a left leg hit by Alison Becker on Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoli in the group phase of the Championship League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in UEFA Europe League on Thursday in London.
The number of Tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were captured in the ruins of the buildings falling into the earthquake with a power of 7.5 hit on Friday and caused waves of 20 feet high, the spokesman of the Sutopo Purvo Nugroho agency at the press conference said.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was buried by a ruined building.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after the woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation started since this morning a woman's body was found in Birkenheed, Merciside.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stabbed wounds on Grayson Moves Street John, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police asked people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Inspector Brian Ohagen said: “The investigation is in the initial stage, but I would ask people near John Street in Birkhenhead, who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxiers, who may have taken something on the car cameras to contact us because they can have information that is important to our investigation."
The police spokesman that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in the facility.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is in progress, and as the police said, they will inform the victim's closest people.
A cabman who lives in Grayson Mows just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him he was not allowed to enter, nor to leave the building.
He lost his words when he found out what happened.
The lodgers were now informed that they would be going to spend hours before they could return.
Someone heard a cop tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene a woman appeared in tears.
She repeats “this is so terrible. ”
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were in the border, and one was outside.
A number of police officers were standing in the border and watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact anonymous crime fighters on 0800 555 111 quoting record 247 of September 30th.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament has become the latest memorial strike in the quarrel to "prescribe history"
Her persecution would be a poetic justice for his "taliban" destruction of a large number of cultural and religious artefacts performed by his fanial puritanian followers.
Mr. Creek's company, however, described Mr. Creek's proposal as "wise" and "a attempt to overwrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the elimination of statues, it was unavoidable that Oliver Cromwell's figure before the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The Econoclass of English Civil Wars was neither ordered, nor led by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for his ancestor, Thomas, in the past century.
The wonderful presentation of Cromwell of Sir William Hammo Thornaycroft is proof of opinion in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe that it is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: "Mnogy consider, perhaps, more late in the 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a parliament defender of external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether this is a totally exact show is the subject of a continuing historic debate.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognized figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth glorifying and mentioning."
A pig killer splits and kills a Chinese farmer
The pig attacked and killed a farmer in Southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the name "Juan", was found dead with a crushed arterial, scattered in blood near a cock of the Liupanschui market in the province of Gitzou, South China, reported Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to put vaccines on pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Kinghai Province, China.
He seemed to travel with his cousin from the neighbouring province Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the neighbouring pig cab.
He stated that there was a great veeper in the wax with the blood of the squirrel.
Forensic survey confirmed that a vepar of 550 pounds broke the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and broken," said the cousin, named "Vu," quoted in Guyang's evening news.
The security camera video showed Juan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Juan or his cousin.
The market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent the attack of other people, while the police gather evidence in the place.
Juan's family and market responsibilities are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pigs that attacked people have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries in the husband.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 650 pounds tapped the welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife expelled the animal.
After the farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer said to CBC News that pigs were not normally aggressive, but the blood taste could act as a "activater".
"They're just playing."
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want anyone to hurt deliberately.
You just need to give them enough respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Rosa will bring poor rain in the southwest of the United States
As foretold, hurricane Rosa weakens while moving through cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
Still, Rosa will bring rain floods in northern Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought 85 mph winds, a categories hurricane from 5 o'clock east of Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is starting to be formed over the Pacific and moves east to the west coast of the United States, as Rosa approaches the Dolna California half island on Monday as a tropical storm will start bringing a large tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico's parts on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture with the approaching depression will create rich rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, flows of ruins and possible slips of land in the desert.
The large tropical moisture will cause rainfall in some places approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Maximum 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in the majority of Arizona.
Rapid floods are caused because of rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the diverted nature of the tropical rain.
Especially recommended not to go to the desert by tropical rain.
The rain can cause Canyons to become rainbow rivers, and the storm of storms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The nearing depression will bring a local rain on the parts of the coast of Southern California.
The rains of more than half inches are possible, which can cause rivers of ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region of their wet season.
The occasional tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early in the morning Monday, before the rain spreads more late Monday and Tuesday.
The rain will spread into the four corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected everywhere in the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropical areas remain high.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
Excellent example of dramatic differences in temperatures will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to regenerate and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States are expected to have a warm start of October with high temperatures 80 degrees from the south plains to the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our prognosis for a long time indicates the possibility of overlap temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States, until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brad Cavano's hearing
More than 20 million people saw the exciting testimony on Thursday of the nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, and the woman accused of sexual assault that happened in the 80s, Christina Blacy Ford, on six TV networks.
Meanwhile, the ultimate political situation continued, with speakers who interrupted regular programs on the last Friday turn: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, made an agreement with the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate's court committee that Cavano was 100 per cent sure that Cavano had a piano and tried to take off her clothes for a high-school party.
Cavano, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, according to Nelsen, saw him on Friday.
The company counted the average visibility of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nelsen usually has difficulties measuring people who look at offices.
To make it better, it's an audience with a size similar to a play-up game in football or awards of the film academy.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders have severely attacked Cavano's appointment, led to all networks with 5.69 million viewers in average during the full-day hearing, said Nelsen.
ABC was a second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.2 million, Nelsen said.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After the Republican office moderately announced that he would vote for Cavano, CNN and CBS cameras caught as protesters calling on Friday morning while he was trying to enter the elevator for the hearing of the court committee.
He was standing with a depressed eye for a few minutes while he was disrespected, and all of that was transferred live to CNN.
"They stand here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on the earth"?
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door was closed, there would be more to say during the committee's hearing.
Cable and radio-difusion networks all covered hours later, when the court committee was to vote for the promotion of Cavano's nomination in the voting Senate.
But Flake said he would do it only if there was a deal with the FBI that they would consider the charges against the nominated next week, which was requested by the minority of democrats.
Flake was convinced partly by talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After the talk with Coons, and with a few senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was very important, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavano without investigation.
President Tramp opened a FBI investigation for the charges against Cavano.
British Prime Minister Mae blames criticists for "playing Policy" regarding the coastal
Prime Minister Teresa May accused criticists of her plans to leave the European Union for "playing policy" with the British future and undermining national interests in the Sunday Times interview.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived for the Conservative Party's conference in Birmingham, Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to that on the main page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Bragzit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect borrowing costs is "a totally absurd".
Wade Simms Shoot: Police arrested Deteon Simpson's suspect for the death of the sportsman at Louisiana's state university
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Simms, 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana's state university.
Twenty-year-old Diteon Simpson was arrested and detained under charge of murder by second degree, Baton Rouge police department said.
The authorities announced a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and the police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB partner of CBS said.
After the interrogation of Simpson, the police said he confessed to shoot Wade and killed him.
His bail is set to $350,000, the lawyer said.
The patologist's office of the parish of East Baton Rouge announced the preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was shot a wound in the head to the neck.
The Division thanks Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, State Police Criminal Lab, Southern University Police and Citizens for the area of assistance they provided in the investigation that led to arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana's state university thanked the police for its "activity in search of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
A 6.6-foot beck grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for Louisiana's state university.
He had a average of 5.6 points and 2.6 balls caught in the game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball team coach at Louisiana's state university, Will Wade, said that the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" of Simms' death.
"This is what you care for all the time," the coach said.
Vulcan threw ashes into Mexico City
The exhaustion of ashes from the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern settlements in Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after the crater started and 183 gas and ashes were registered within 24 hours.
The center followed more scratches and shakes.
Social media pictures show a thin layer of ashes on cars in Mexico’s settlements, such as Socimilko.
Geophysists noticed an increase in volcanic activity located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital after the 7.1 earthquake shook Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police conflicted with catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence protesters confronted with the public order and peace police and after thousands joined the rival demonstration on the first year of the polarisation vote for Catalonia's cutting.
A group of masked separatists held by public order police and peace throwing eggs and colors in dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would usually be filled with tourists.
Later the day, they also exploded fights, and the police used the sticks to combat the fights.
For more than a few hours the independence groups cried "No forgetting, no forgiveness," and the union protesters, on the other hand, screamed "Spain Long Live".
Fourteen people were treated for smaller injuries received in protests, local press said.
Tensions are still high in the region that wants independence, one year after Madrid characterized the referendum on October 1st, but it was celebrated by the separatist catalans.
Most voters voted for independence, although the exit was small because of the boycott by the people who were against cutting.
According to the catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people have been injured last year after the police violently tried to stop the vote at the voters in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations to support national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narciss Termes, who participated in the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer hopes Catalonia has a chance of getting independence.
"The last year we had one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the vital, but narrow victory of the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence partys have been trying to keep the dynamic this year with many of their most famous leaders or in self-elect persecution or in custody waiting for a trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the consistent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, recording the police support protest, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
"It becomes all intense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine catalan leaders who are in prison before the trial last year, announced that they will run to the European Parliament's elections next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the repression of democratic values and the reprise we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.

At one point it could be shot by arrow from a gun to the car.
Menga's hit brought Livingstone victory 1 - 0 against Rangers
The first goal of the Dolly Menga for Livingston secured victory
The advanced Livingstone stamped the Rangers by signing Steven Gerard, with only two losses in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
The hit of Dolly Menga showed to be meaningful while Gary Hold's side rose to one level with Hibernian in the second position.
Gerard's country has lost guest winning this season and will face the leaders of Harts next week, behind which they remain with eight points.
Before that, Rapid Vienna will be hosted by the League in Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues unbeaten in the division during six matches, and Coach Holt has not failed since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston missed the chance against the cruel guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before they gave the goal, and their directness caused many problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke himself, but dragged the attack around the naked, then Alan Litgow could only direct his efforts away after slipping played the head of Craig Halket over the naked.
The guests were happy to let Rangers play before them, knowing they could create problems with their actions.
And that's how the crucial naked came.
The Rangers missed a free strike, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up together Menga, who only touched the naked from the centre of the sixteen.
Until that moment, the Rangers were dominated in possession of the ball, but they couldn't break the defense of the hosts, so the goal Liam Kelly didn't play mostly.
That scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performs a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to give naked because of the skill of the Rangers' goal, Alan McGregor, and Litgow took the ball away from another set action in Livingston.
Livingstone's sixteen was constantly passing through and was constantly defensive, while two tool requests -- after Halket's dispute about Glenn Midlton's replacement and one for a hand-played game -- were rejected.
Livingstone’s “Fenomenal” – Analysis
Alasder Lamont of BBC Scotland in the arena Tony Macaroni
Fenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to overcome the expectations of this upward path.
Their style and character of playing has barely changed after their return to the top, but a large part of the credit goes to Holt about the way the team was galvanized from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was excellent, managing super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warral on ready.
Rangers still missed their inspiration.
As they used to be good under Gerard's leadership, they are now behind the same standards.
Their last game was weak -- only once they managed to open households -- and it was a small awareness of Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan got a mixed receipt in Colonia
There were smiles and blue sky on Sunday (September 29) when Turkish and Germany leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit to President Erdogan to Germany, which is aimed at fixing relations between NATO allies.
They were worse because of the problems involved in human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to the Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent a 25,000 crowd from gathering before the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Thousands of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds also declared, condemning Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The opposed protesters reflect the division of the visitor famous as a hero of some German Turks and criticised as a autocrat from others.
Traffic accident on the road to Deptford: a bikeman died in a car crash
The velosipedist died after a car struggle in London.
The conflict occurred near the crossroad of the streets of Bestud and Evelyn, a highly disturbed trafficker in Deptford, in the southeast of the city at about 10.15 BST.
The driver stopped and an emergency came, but the husband died at the scene of the accident.
The conflict occurred a few months after the death of another bikeman in a traffic accident on Childers Street where the driver fled, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan police said officials are working on identifying the husband and informing his family.
The road blocks are set and the buses are redirected and the drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six police officers injured in anxiety
Six prison police officers are injured in an unrest in a male prison with high safety level, said the prison office.
The riots exploded at HMP Long Martin in Warchestshire at about 9.30 BST on Sunday and still last.
The Tornado units were brought to address the riots, which include eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
The cops are treated for small injuries in the spot.
The prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel was directed to deal with the current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible for that will be transferred to the police and may spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was announced that the prison governor had received hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the public order and peace police were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances with which the staff was attacked by balls for a billion.
The hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (may be useful for dry areas)
Rarely a tropical depression occurs to hit Arizona, but it will probably happen at the beginning of the next week when the remaining force of the hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwest region, risking sudden floods.
The state meteorological station has already issued warnings on possible sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona, until south and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flegstaff, Las Vegas and Soyte Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move through Phoenix on Tuesday, nearing Monday late with rain.
The state meteorological station in Phoenix announced in Twitter that only “the ten tropical cycles kept the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katherine (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the State Hurricane Centre foresee two to four inches of rain, with isolated quantities up to six inches in the edge of the Mongolon of Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basen, will probably have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risk of sudden floods, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to be useful because the southwest region is affected by drought.
According to the US Sushi Monitoring Authority, almost 40 percent of Arizona face extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com said.
First, the trip of the hurricane Rosa led to land strikes everywhere on the Dolna California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with a hurricane in Sunday morning with winds of maximum 85 miles a hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north 12 miles an hour.
The storm comes in contact with cold waters in the Pacific and falls.
Therefore, rains are expected in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on Monday or evening hours.
Rains in Mexico parts may be intense and are a significant risk of floods.
"The rain is expected from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwest of Sonora, with possible maximum 10 inches of rain," weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona in early mornings on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and south of Utah until late evening on Tuesday.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is a lot of rich rains in Dolna California, southwestern Sonora and the desert Southwestern region of the United States," stated the State Hurricane Centre.
These rains are expected to bring vitally dangerous floods and flows from ruins, as well as slipping the land into mountain regions.
Attack at Midsamer Norton: Four arrested for attempting murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempts to kill after a 16-year-old man was found with stabbed wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace of Midsamer Norton around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He's taken to the hospital and is in a "stable" condition.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old arrested during the night in Radstock, the police of Avon and Summerset said.
The police asked if anyone had the cell phone recordings of the incident to step forward.
Tramp said Cavano "has suffered the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Cavano is a vote to reject the most cruel and scandal tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramp said at a meeting in Willing, West Virginia.
Tramp said Cavano "has suffered the greatest evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Cavano witnessed before the convention on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Cristina Blacy Ford’s accusations that he committed a sexual attack on her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford witnessed the hearing of her accusations.
The President said on Saturday that "the Americans saw the brilliantness, quality and courage" of Cavano that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Cavano is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an integral public service file," he said before the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly mentioned Cavano's nomination when he talked about the importance of the Republicans' exit in early elections.
"Five more weeks to one of our most important elections.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting," he said.
"There is why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for excellent candidates."
Tramp said the democrats have a mission to "gave resistance and obstruct".
The first key vote for Cavano's nomination in the Senate is expected not later than Friday, the older GOP manager for CNN said.
Thousands of Dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the total number of victims grows
At least 384 people died, many were taken away from the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island Sulavesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered together for the beach festival in Palu on Friday, when waves of 6 meters (18 feet) hit the coast of the sun, treating many in a safe death and destroying everything in their way.
After the 7-5, the earthquake hit tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and weren't running immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, speaker of the BNPB agency for mediation in Indonesia's briefing disasters in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, woods, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the open sea with 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hiting the coast.
Some people climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palu.
The air photographs published by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and stores, wrapped and crashed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The last shakes continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in a area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said that the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was approximately 200 times greater than the energy released from the Hyroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coast, may increase the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, trade centres and hotels have crashed.
The bodies of some victims were found stuck under the shock of the crashed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be higher along the coast of 300 miles (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There live more than 300,000 people," Red Cross said in the announcement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse," they said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday that she had not informed that tsunami hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves came about at the same time when the warning was issued.
In an amateur video divided by social media, a man of the upper floors of the building can be heard as he screamedly shouts, warning people on the street down about the tsunami approaching.
In a few minutes, the wall of water is spilled on the coast, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an end to electricity that cut the communications around Palu, making the authorities difficult to coordinate rescue activities.
The military has started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuated persons still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened only for help and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia rises over 800.
It's really bad.
While the World Vision staff from Dongala came safely to town Palu, where employees hideed in shelter shelters in the courtyard of their office, they passed through the scenes of desolation, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's so bad.
Even while the aid groups began the dark attempts to start helping the disaster, some regretted that foreign aid experts were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and foreign personnel can only begin to come if the scene of the disaster is declared a zone of national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Ariani, speaker for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'All right, this is a national disaster', we can receive international assistance, but there is still no status."
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hoped that their beloved would be miracles that would facilitate the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers saved a woman who was stuck under the shock for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian State Team for Paraglaidership, trained two of the missing paragladerists for Asian games, ended at the beginning of the month in Indonesia.
The others stuck in Roa Roa Roa, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paraglaidership, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me how when he started circulating the news of the ruining of Roa Roa Roa in the paragladerist community, he desperately sent messages to whatsApp to the competitors from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a grey sign of scratching, instead of with a son.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26.750 while filling a banknote at the Cayo Newport
Thieves stolen on Friday morning from a employee in Brink's employee who complemented a bankomat at the Newport Cay, according to a press statement from the Newport police station.
The driver of the car released the bankomate in the entertainment complex and was preparing to complete it with money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for delivery.
The Witnesses noticed more suspects running from the crime scene, according to the statement, but the police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Canye West: The Rapper Changed His Name in J.
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to her.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday, and he wrote: "The creature known earlier as Kanje West."
Forty - a year - old West was wearing her nickname for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurred just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to publish his new Yandhi album.
He will replace Ariana Grande's singer on the show that he had to cancel for "emotional reasons," the producer of the show said.
Although he used it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West said earlier that the word had religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the most commonly used word in the Bible and there means 'ye'," West said at the beginning of this year, discussing the title of his album with the Big Boy Radio Guide.
"What do you mean, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
He moved away from Kanja, which means the only one, to her, the reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a picture of who we are."
He is one of the many known rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Paf Daddy, Pee Deedy or Deedy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brader Love (Love and Brother Love).
The former associate of West, J.Z., also uses his name with or without a cream and all the big letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises that he will not use the army against civilians
VD President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against civilians while the country was approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolko Plaza that “he would never use the army to reprise the Mexican people. ”
The army fired peaceful demonstrators at the square on October 2, 1968, killing only 300 people in the time when the left student movements enrolled in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador claimed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, so the United States should double research funds in the field, the investor and practitioner told AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrived after various parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it seeks to be number one in the innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubled budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far before the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funds can double the chances that the next major achievement in the AI area will make the United States, Lee told the CNBC interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Super powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the Director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s of the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the highest ranked American steel player, and later he was director at Microsoft Research and the president of the Google district in China.
Lee thanked for the previous U.S. government technology competitions as a challenge in the robotics of the Agency for advanced research projects in the defence and asked when the next match will be, to help identify the following visioners.
U.S. researchers often need to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that took the academic leaders, it's corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to improve their efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think "green cards" should be automatically offered to doctors of science after artificial intelligence," he said.
China's State Council issued its Plan for the Development of the future generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Science Foundation finances people in academic institutions similar to the way that the Fond for Natural Sciences and Other government organizations are handing money to researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry set up the Association Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which should cover partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of the Authorised Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for the initiative called "AI Next".
As for NSA, they currently invest more than 100 million dollars a year in research of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation demanding the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been operational for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum about whether to change the country's name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday about whether to change her name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a move that would solve a decade dispute with Greece that blocked its membership requirements in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of her north neighbour is the right to place its territory and put veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's orthodox population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote at the referendum and the Boycott campaign has questioned whether the output would fulfil the minimum 50 per cent required for the validity of the referendum.
The referendum ticket question was: "You have been membership with NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece."
The supporters of the change in the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying in order to allow access to bodies such as the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so they can live free under the nipper of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-third majority in the parliament is required to change the name.
The state election committee said there were no irregularities by 13:00.
However, the output was 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the past parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I went out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gioše Tanevski, a capital voter, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Duško voted to the referendum in Macedonia for a change in the country's name, opening the way for the country to enter NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small scene and chairs in front of tents placed by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with heads raised high, not from the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring a lot of necessary investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will be for because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said since he voted.
He said the result "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future".
The survey, published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Research, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is under the necessary exit.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian Television Telma, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote by yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the output should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of a referendum would be the first serious impact of the pro-western government's policy since they arrived in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero on Manchester City has passed the entire defense of Bryton for goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly defeated Bryton's defense in the 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received an environment in the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He passed quickly between the three defense players of Bryton before he entered the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four "green".
Circle a defense player before he runs a few others on the edge of Bryton's sixteen.
He then passed the left of him, to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first arrival to the sixteen to return Aguero's ball, who violated Bryton's right leg, Matthew Ryan, with the only hit on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told the journalists.
“We talked about playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you gave it naked at that moment."
But the initial advantage of the "Sky Blue" gave Sterling in the fight for the Prime Minister of the League.
The naked came in 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Bryton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before he led Sterling to the distant article.
The attack of the "Sky Blue" entered the ball into the network before he went out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in a team of championships on Tuesday 12,55 in Rine-Necar Arena, Germany.
Shercer wants to play a spoiler against Rockys.
Since Nationals were eliminated by the playoff fight, there was no reason to force another start.
But always competitive Shercer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rokis, but only if there are still implications for the playoff for the Rocky team, who run a game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rokis team had at least a "joker" to win 5 - 2 over Nationals on Friday night, but they still fight to establish their place in the first division.
"If we don't play for anything, at least we can throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any moment I will face this year.
Why don't I want to compete in that?"
Nationals still need to announce the launcher in a week, but they are allegedly inclined to allow Shercer to throw in such a situation.
Shercer, who starts after 34th, trained to throw Thursday and would throw usual vacation on Sunday.
Washington's right is 18 - 7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strike points in 220 2/3 ininci this season.
Tramp Mithins in Western Virginia
The President indirectly mentioned the situation about his choice of Brett Cavano to the Supreme Court while talking about the importance of the release of the Republicans at the early elections.
"Everything we've done so far will be put on a cube in November.
Five more weeks to one of our most important elections.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really fighting, so I'm fighting for excellent candidates everywhere," he said.
Tramp continued, "You see these horrible, horrible groups of democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they are determined to regain their power using all the resources available to them, to see evil, disgusting.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, when they're going to go over to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we're not going to give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "gave resistance and obstruct".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "anger, wicked, rude and untruthful."
He mentioned Senator Diana Finnstein from the orders of democrats, set by the Senate's Judicial Committee, named, to which the audience responded with crying to anger.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, wait a minute -- that was a very bad body speech -- the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
Laborists no longer accept different opinions.
Do not tolerate those who express their opinions
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last member of the parliamentary part of the lab party to whom we have been told that we are not welcome - just because he expresses his opinion.
My colleague parliamentary Joan Ryan got a similar treatment because he took a decisive attitude against antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticised me for disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, for Europe, ironicly similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement on the meeting of the East Laboratory Party of Nottingham stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In most of my eight years as a member of the Parliament of the Laborist Party, meetings of the Council on Friday night were just like that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a "better, gentle" policy has long been forgotten if it really, ever started.
It is increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the lab party, and every opinion is convicted whether it is acceptable to the leaders of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when the colleagues I thought that we had shared a similar political opinion had started expecting me to completely change my mind and take the views that I would never take differently, whether it was a national security or an internal security of the EU.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there's a critical abuse of social media calling on conviction, denying the policy of the centre, telling me that I should not be in the lab party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know that I have more happiness than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed to me are usually political.
I have a great fear of professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuse every day, but they never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the lab party should practice culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every request for "no trust" or changing the rules of selection, the party becomes more tight.
I received a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then “all will be fine. ”
But that's not the reason I came to politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the Laborist Party as a student, provoked by the negligence of Thacher's government that literally left my classroom to fall down, I struggled to improve public services for those who are most needed, whether as a local advisor or government minister.
I never hid my policy, including the last elections.
No one in Eastern Nottingham could be confused in no way for my political attitudes and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
Those who supported the request on Friday, all I want to say is that when the country is going to force to Bregzit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy of my loyalty to the leader of the Laboratory Party.
But I have a message that is not about Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members of the lab party or not: I am proud of serving you and I promise that no matter how condemning threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will distract me from acting in a way I think it's in the best interest of all of you.

Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: The Unbeaten Ear goes to the top
Two late points may have changed the final result somehow, but there is no doubt that the Ear deserved the triumph in this beautiful entertaining game on the day of Scotland's football Championship.
They're now on the top of the table, the only invincible side of the tens.
Finally, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as to their improved exploited chances, taken by the home team, and coach Peter Murci has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our competitions so far and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christy from Melrose said: “Happy for the ear, they better use their chances than us. ”
The point of Grant Anderson in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Climo, gave the Ear advantage, but the Yellow Card for Scotch Captain Rory Hughes, given for the game of Wariors, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Bag got an unconverted point.
Climo renewed the Ear’s direction with a tool, earlier, exactly in half - time, he reached a point, so he converted a solo point to reach 17 - 5 for the Eaure in the rescue.
But Melrose started the second half, and the point of Patrick Andreson, converted by God, reduced leadership to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury of Ruarid Nott, who was exposed to the noses, and since the restart, the Eare continued to fight with the point of Staford McDowal, converted by Climo.
The VD captain of the Ear, Blair McFerson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for the additional man with an unconverted point of Bruce Colvin at the end of the time with embarrassed pressure.
But the home crew returned, and when Struan Hatchinson got a yellow Climo's ball-breaking card, McFerson plays a tatchduan on the back of the Ear's sharp attack.
Climo converted, like he did again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Row took David Armstrong's hit and sent Gregor Henry's wing player to the fifth point for the home team.
The Still Game Star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry

The fifty-sixth anniversary plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which is a scriptist and plays with a long-year-old comedy partner, Greg Hamfield.
Duoto announced that the next ninth season will be the last, and it appears that Kirnan plans for life after Kregleng.

"The sea is ours," Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Navy patrols in a hidden-fake seat in La Paz.
Public buildings set a sea blue flag.
Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are tapped with the motto: “The sea is our right.
It's a duty to return to us."
Through the land of Bolivia, the memorial of the coast lost for Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still fresh, such as the desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be largest in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace and of course expects a positive outcome," Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Great Screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will judge in favour of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of variable talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to appoint a sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Here's Morales, Bolivia's harrismatic president with a native origin, who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year, also a lot depends on the verdict on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he sacredly said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not judge in favour of Bolivia and that it will not change much even to their benefit.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chile territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The verdict of the international court comes only six months after the ultimate arguments indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And for the last four years, they may have reversed Bolivia’s cause instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of accession to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military rhetoric ruined Chile's remaining good will, suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at a certain point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Welce, Bolivian representative in Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unbelievable opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and the opportunity for "to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadia also rejected that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the problem with the sea as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we should overcome the past."
North Korea says there won't be nuclear disarmament if she can't trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm his nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He urged the United States to keep their promises made during the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His comments came at the time when US Secretary Mike Pompeo was on the edge of restarting the blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Yong Un.
Ri says it's "fiction" to be considered that the continued sanctions and opposition of the United States to declare the declarative end of Korean war will bring North Korea to the knees.
Washington is cautious to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang to take significant disarmament measures first.
And Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Tramp, want a second summit.
But there is a great scepticism that Pyongyang is serious to quit the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit of Kim-Tramp.
Paris Fashion Reviews reveal the latest line of massive hats that are on the way to the largest stores in your neighborhood.
If you want to improve the size of your collection of hats or completely block the sun, then do not look further.
Valentino and Tom Brown designers discovered a series of freaked too large hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set on the Fashion Week in Paris.
Finally, the irregular hats launched Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their creations falling in the eye of the road.
The piece that was highlighted from Valentino was a huge be hat decorated with a wide range of feathers that flooded the head of the model.
Other too large supplements included circulars, magic hat, or even ananas, but they are not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for the Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewed lips and were more like Hannibal Lector than high fashion.
One creative was like a diving equipment full of swimming glasses and a diving pipe, and the other looked like a melting ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style trackers predict that the huge hats can come to your stores nearby.
The too large hats came very quickly after the "La Bomba", the slammed hat with a wide two feet that all from Rianna carry to Emily Ratakovski.
The cultivate fashion house standing behind a too irregular hat spread through the social media sent another large creation after the climb, a slam bag of a beach size almost equal to the elevation of the model that was dragging.
The dark orange bag, with a raphia and a white leather handle, was a piece highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus on the Fashion Week in Paris.
The Stilist of the famous, Luke Armitaz, told F.S.A.: “I expect to see the large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer, because the designer has caused so much influence that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too large supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results of the examinations, which is only strengthening with individual and group success in sports, art, music and other submissions of the community.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools presented by the Scotland Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are trying to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educative centre that can design and implement adapted school programs, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable as a selective object in schools.
Nelson Mendela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it will make him fancy.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it'll hit him in the soul."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build connections and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the tests this year, we can note that languages exceed all other items with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn foreign languages have reached a higher estimate of 5+.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of the students reached a higher "5+" in mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who learned German, 69 per cent of those who learned French and 63 per cent of Spanish also reached "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly acquire in the future.
Languages are now, as a selection object, seen at the same level as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programmes as well as in other places.
A survey of the OCK Employment and Skills Commission noted in 2014 that 17 percent were due to lack of language skills because of the reasons employers had been induced in the field of jobs.
Thus, language skills become more obligatory to prepare young people for their future career.
With more jobs that seek languages, these skills are necessary in the globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they learn the second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such lifetime skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polyglot advantage before competition.
According to yougov’s survey of more than 4,000 adults in O.K. in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language enough to speak, and the French was the only language that spoke over ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
Therefore, investing in language learning is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those in the development economy, will equip children with better chances to find significant employment.
In Scotland, every school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on classic modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered the most important in OK when they look into the future by 2020, as mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what interests your child is, there will always be many languages from which you can choose in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this area.
The Scottish independent schools are dedicated to provide the environment of learning that will prepare children and arm them with the skills needed for success, regardless of the future.
At the moment, it cannot be denyed, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in schools.
In fact, modern languages really should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and excellence for young people in Scotland.
“Il faut bien le faire” (this must be done).
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
Lebron will take Lakers to debit in San Diego on Sunday.
Waiting almost finished for fans who wanted to see Lebron James start up for Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lekers Coach Luke Walton announced that James was going to play the first game in the precesion on Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's playing, it's still not decided.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
The reporter for Lakers, Mike Trudel, wrote a tweet that James would probably play a limited time.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked about his plans for six games before the Lakers season.
"I don't need games in presecond in this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Channel on Ju-Tube for the Tramp miting in Western Virginia
President Donald Tramp started a series of mythins as part of the campaign tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It's the first of the five appointments of Tramp next week, including visits in favored places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the voting for confirmation of his choice to fill the empty place in the Supreme Court is in peace, Tramp is trying to build support for the forthcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because the Republicans can lose control in the Congress with the vote in November.
At what hour is the Tramp event in West Virginia, and how do you view it on the Internet?
Tramp's meeting in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 afternoon. Time zone on the eastern coast tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Tramp's event in West Virginia through the Internet with a live transfer to YouTube.
This week is likely that Tramp will address the hearing of a man nominated for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, which has become tense because of the accusations of sexual behaviour with expected delay in the Senate by a week, while the FBI's investigation is ongoing.
The primary goal of the series of mythins is to help the Republicans get a swing for the elections in November .
This is where President Tramp's campaign said that these five mythins next week are focused on "provoking volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," says Reuters.
"The convention's control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many federal states as possible at the beginning of the hard campaign season," the speaker from Tramp's Reuters campaign, who refused to be appointed.
Scheduled in the Wesbanko Arena in Willing, the tonight's event can attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pitsburgh," according to the news of Metro from West Virginia.
Saturday is the second visit to Tramp to Western Virginia in the last month, the country in which he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Western Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisei, who remains on the surveys.
"It's not good for Maurice that the president must come to improve the popularity of the surveys," Simon Hyder, politicist from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Coup Ryder 2018: United States team showed courage in the fight to keep hopes in the beginning of the Sunday individual games
After three single seasons, the four of Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what Coop Ryder needed.
Fortunateness of happiness is a totally invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and mostly in such competitions.
Who would you say happiness is now?
"They had six points leadership, and now there are four, so we have little luck assuming," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
The Europeans have, of course, a four-point leadership and another twelve games.
The Americans, according to Speath, feel that they have a weak wind in the sails even though they have sufficient incentives, if nothing else then the form of Speed and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each achieved three points of four.
Spit was excellent and led by example.
Those strong shouts of celebration became increasing during his game, with a key strike that led to a balance of four or four when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His hit with which he got the 15-year-old match was welcomed with a similar shout, which tells you he believes the American team is not out of the game.
"You just need to deepen up and take care of your competition," Spit said.
That's all that every player has left now.
18 holes to reach a point.
The only players with more scores than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the uncertain story of Coop Ryder.
The strange but beautiful dueo of Europe is four out of four and they can't make mistakes.
"Mollywood" were the only couple without bad hits on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits and Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine Friday morning.
The series and the way they seem to be running their energy to and from this noise group ensures that they are players winning Sunday and that there will be no more popular players that will provide a potential European victory when the sun comes behind Le Golf Nazinal, except Flitwood or Molinari.
It's preferred both at the same time in different holes.
However, talks about European glory remain unreasonable.
Bubba Watson and Web Simson quickly handled Serjo Garcia, the morning hero of double couples, when he connected with Alex Norren.
A failure and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they never managed to get out.
On Sunday, however, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The two couples and fours are so fascinating to see closely because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give themselves, the advice that they do not listen to, and how the strategy can be changed suddenly.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved significant leadership on the last day, but the fourth season also showed that the US team could fight although some, especially Americans, had doubts.
Europeans led with 10-6 on the last day of Coop Ryder
Europe will enter with solid advantage on the last day of Coupet Ryder after Saturday leadership in double couples and fours of 10-6 before the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories while Tyger Woods was trying to take the leadership of Le Golf Nassional on four points so far.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was fighting to keep the trophy he lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated in front of the American team who had a lot of failures in the morning double couples and won a series of 3-1.
The Americans gave more resistance in fours, winning two matches, but they couldn't reach the leadership.
Jim Furic's team needs eight points of 12 individual games a week to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European starter who won four points consistently, while he and Molinari, called "Molivud" after the sensational weekend, are the second couple at all winning four points in the first four matches in the history of Coop Ryder.
After they "smashed" Woods and Patrick Reed in double couples, they played great and defeated the exhausted Woods and US starter Bryson Deshambu with even more explicit results 5&4.
Woods, who walked through two swords on Saturday, played great at times, but now lost 19 out of 29 games in double couples and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, rested while the morning double couples lasted, returned as Henry Stanson's partner in the fourth defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coopet - ranked first and third in the world.
Nevertheless, the Europeans weren't all after their pleasant, wind day south-west of Paris.
The three dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a measure for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They have reached a decisive victory of 2&1 over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Pulter in double couples and returned later to beat Pulter and Rory McClaroy with 4&3 in fours, but they lost the starting, two holes.
Only twice in the history of Coop Ryder, a certain team was recovered from a lack of four points in a single game, although as the title holders, the Furic team had sufficient equal results to keep the trophy.
Since it was two days, however, the weekly contrast seems to remain over them.
North Korea says "No chance" to disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the prolonged sanctions deepen the lack of confidence in the United States and that there is no way that the country will quit nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world's body that North Korea has taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear missiles tests, unmounting nuclear test structures and committed itself against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see the right answer by the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, it will not trust our national security and there is no way we unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri repeated North Korea's famous complaints on Washington's resistance to the accession of nuclear disarmament "in stages", according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because he did not refuse unilaterally, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri acknowledged the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Tramp at the first summit at all of the current US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to work towards the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Tramp guaranteed North Korea's security security guarantee.
North Korea requests a formal end of the Korean war from 1950-53, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must quit nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refuses to resign in strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"United States insist on "nuclear disarmament above all" and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their goal by force and even oppose "the war end declaration," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can kneel on our knees is a vain dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Tramp, which the US leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jahe-in in the past five months and added: "If the other party in this nuclear disarmament problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not end in such an endocrat."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from the last year, when he said to the UN General Assembly that the direction of north Korean missiles towards the American land was inevitable after the "Mr. wicked president" Tramp called Kim "raketar" with a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Tramp, who last year threatened "complete destruction" of North Korea, much more praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament steps, but said it remains to do a lot of work and that sanctions must remain until the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Tramp said he had no time frame for that, saying "Does it take two years, three or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the sanctions of the Security Council must continue fully and without exceptions until fully confirmed, finally nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ree at the margins of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo's already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time it didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress was made, but he was denied from North Korea only a few hours later for "gangster demands".
North Korea committed a meeting with Moon this month for disarmament of a rocket building, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States take "suitable measures".
He said Kim told him that "suitable measures" he's looking for are the security guarantees Tramp gave in Singapore, as well as moves to normalize relations with Washington
Harvard Students visit courses to get enough holiday
The new course of the Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep to fight the growing maco-cultural learning with staying awake all night with caffeine.
A researcher discovered that the world’s leading university students often know nothing about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Chaseler, a professor of medicine in the dream of the Harvard Medical Faculty and a woman's hospital specialist, designed the course he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after conducting a speech on the influence of insufficient sleep on learning.
"In the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?"
She said no one, never told her about the importance of sleep -- that surprised me," he said to the Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains students the grounds for how good sleeping habits help in the academic and athletic results and improve general well-being.
Paul Barera, a psychiatric professor at the Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of health services at the university said the university decided to introduce the course after they discovered that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a student’s home where students press on cups of coffee, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how insufficient sleep affects athletic results and the importance of the routine when going to bed.
Otherwise, participants learn how long - term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know about health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette," Professor Chaseler added.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and also modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the lack of sleep is a growing problem.
To have enough sleep, with a good quality, it should be a "secret weapon" of the student in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid fatty, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to go into a hunger regime, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old student from California in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Chaseler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year, at his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduates to complete a similar program before they join the competitive institution.
Professor Chaseler recommended that students think about setting an alarm on when to go to bed, and when to wake up and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "Blue Light" emitted from electronic screens and the LED light, which mixes the circuit rhythm, leading to problems with sleeping.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga’s Goal has slaughtered Gerard’s people
Rangers suffered another exciting, sad day when Dolly Menga's hit sent Steven Gerard's team to defeat with 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to register his first victory after the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team took the second defeat of Gerard's team in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind the screwed leading team of Harts in the Scotland First League.
Menga pointed seven minutes before the half-time and Rangers' setup lost inspiration and the chances of alignment.
Now the Rangers fell to the sixth place, and Livingston climbed to the third and they're just behind Hibernian according to the difference in their heads.
There may be additional problems that Rangers are waiting for since the linear judge Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for head injury after he was obviously hit by a subject from a distance.
Gerard made eight changes in the Aer's team at the semi-final of the Battle of Bethfred.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 in Livingston who won a point with Harts last week and would be happy in the way his well trained set choked the opponents at every chance.
Rangers may have dominated the property over the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball of them.
They should have reached a point, two minutes after the start of Menga's first play, when Scott Pittman walked down to Alan McGregor's goal, but the medium player missed the chance.
Then a hit from the distance of Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgow could only play openly in defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed to have more hope than faith in their last third game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should get a penalty at the fifteenth minute when he and Stephen Lawles crashed, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not give a sign of the approval of the Colombian's complaint.
Rangers were able to reach only two shots towards the goal in the first half time, but the former golfman of Ibrox Liam Kelly didn't struck the head of Lassana Culibali and the weak blow of this Edaria.
Although the beginning of the 34th minute of Livingston may have been contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Again, the Rangers failed to handle Jacobs' hit.
Scott Alfred did not respond when Declan Gallagher added Scott Robinson's ball, who chose Menga with a cold head to a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Culabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a rapid impact when the wing player passed through Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from its line with the blockade.
But Livingstone managed to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoy, while Litgow and Hackett caught a lot of long additions.
Holt's team could have expanded the leadership at the end of the game, but McGregor has set himself well and prevented Jacobs from playing with a head at the corner.
The replacement of Rangers, Glenn Midlton, had another request for a tool since he crashed with Jacobs, but Thompson didn't approve again.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now one side of our almanah on Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE LOCK... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measureing radioactiveness, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger numerator.
Since then it became the main resistance of science, the Gaiger's counter became also the main restraint of popular culture, as in the 1950 "Colorado Bell" film, in which these seemingly unreasonable, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appeared:
Man: “What is that? ”
Rogers: “It is a gaiger numberer used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the phones, you can hear the effects of atoms that release radioactiveness in minerals."
Evans: “Say, it must be jumping now. ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the discovery that brings his name exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the offset cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “look ” out of the cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the distracted cells as part of treatment
The method includes extraction of immune cells from the patient and their changes to the lab
You can "see" protein honour in many types of cancer, and then be restored to the body
The test vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
With a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the distracted cells, the cancer of ovariums disappeared in 18 months.
The method includes extraction of immune cells from the patient, their changes in the lab, so that they can "see" protein honour in many types of cancer called HER2 and then their return to the body.
Professor Jay Berzoffski, from the National Institute for Cancer from Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot."
HER2 "incentives the growth of several cancer species", including breast cancer, ovariums, lungs and colored cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
Similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and their “learning ” as to target cancer cells function in treatment of certain types of leukemia.
Kanie West made a pro-Tramp out, carrying a drop with his motto, after the show on Saturday night in live.
That didn't go well.
Kanje West was observed in the studio during a live show on Saturday night, after a useless performance in which US President Donald Tramp praised and said he would run for a function in 2020.
After the third song that night, called the City of Ghosts, wearing a drop with a sign to make America Slavna again, he began to criticize the democrats and repeat his support for Tramp.
"When I talk to a white man, they say, "How can you like Tramp, he's racist?"
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved out of America for a long time," he said.
Saturday, evening show in live started with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood Star laughed at Brett Cavano's testimony before the Senate Legal Affairs Commission, related to the charges of sexual attack on Christine Blacey Ford.
Although it wasn't transmitted, the recording of West's execution was placed on social media by comictor Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to laugh with West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he was hard to go behind the scene because of his drop.
"Behind the scene they laughed at me.
They told me "Don't show up with that drop."
They've been laughing at me!
Then they told me that I was in a drowned place, he said, according to Washington Exeminer.
West continued: "You want to see the drowned place?" he said he would "pack his superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try with love."
His comments attracted distress from the audience at least twice, and the evening show team seemed ashamed, Varayetti reported, a man said to the publisher: “The entire studio has taken care of. ”
West was brought as a replacement in the last moment for the singing Ariana Grande, whose ex-boy, Rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the song "I like it", dressed as a bottle of Perier.
West received support from the leader of the TSAD Conservative Group, Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest spirits: I thank you for having made a deal with the crowd."
But Karen Hunter's housewife wrote to Twitter that West was "a own and it's absolutely beautiful."
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") which I believe accepts and expands ideology which is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced Twitter that he changed his name, while he was now "formally known as Kaine West".
He is not the first artist who changed his name and follows Deedy’s steps, also known as Paff Daddy, Paff and P. Deedy.
The colleague Rapper, Snoop Dog, has the name Snoop Lyon, and of course the dead musical legend of the Prince, changed his name in symbol, and then in the artist of the former known as Prince.

The Star of the Throne Game, Keith Harrington, attacked the toxic manhood
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled master as John Snow in the violent, medium-century, fantastic game of the thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the stereotype of the maco-hero when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be strong to be respected.
In a statement about the Sanday Times cultural part, Keith said he believes that "this is something wrong" and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic maleness in the age of #SegaRecam.
Keith, who recently married the star of the Game of Trons, Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted that he had "potential feelings" on that issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, at the moment - where did we sin with manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow, about the problems we see now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the growth of toxic maleness, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What is learned from the TV and what on the streets makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of manhood?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
Because it's obvious that something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not participate in the extensions of the Game of Trones when the series ends next summer, saying he "finished with battles and horses".
Since November, Keith will perform the renovation of the Real West of Sam Shepherd, which is a story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The acter recently discovered that he thought that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that he had come from the Game of the Trons.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose played Igrit, a guy who had love attraction with Keith's character, John Snow, in the fantastic series that won the Amy Awards.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's property in Scotland.
HIV/Sid: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and Sida.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A large number of new events were transferred through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have HIV thus decreased to almost zero, the Chinese health authorities said at the Yunan Province Conference.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and Sida in China increased by 100,000 people.
Transfering HIV through sex is an acute issue of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but the discrimination of people from the LGBT community is great.
Because of the country's conservative values, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of disease are due to inappropriate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the data submitted by a staff member related to the senator of the Republican party as "dangerous lies" and "theory of conspiracy"
The United States representative Maxin Waters rejected on Saturday accusations that a member of her staff published personal information to three republic senators in the United States on Wikipedia's pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured that the claims were "ultra-right" sympathys and web sites.
"Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in Twitter's statement.
The publications reportedly include home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orren Hetch from Utah.
Information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while the panel of the Senate's hearing for the abuse of sexual behavior against Bret Cavano, nominated to judge of the Supreme Court.
The information provided appeared shortly after Cavano's interrogation by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redstate announced that the IP address that identifys the source of the announcement is linked to Waters' office and information on Watters' staff is published, Hil reported.
"Those unfortunate accusations are completely false and are absolute lies," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of these incorrect and false accusations - is in no way responsible for the information provided.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and are absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticisms on the Internet, including the former White House's press secretary Ari Flysher.
"Those denials are nervous," Flysher wrote.
"This shows that she has no temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn't do, he must not be angry.
It must not be caused.
He must not ask about the motives of the prosecutor.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher seemed to compare Waters' response to the criticism of democrats related to Judge Cavano, who was accused of criticism because he seemed too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to replace Waters in the middle of the mandate election, also announced Twitter.
"If it's true, that's a big deal," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office informed "the competent institutions and the police of false claims.
"We will allow offenders to be discovered," she continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff."
The thought of Johnny English Attack again - undermine the spy frauds of Rowan Atkinson
Now it is traditional to seek Bragzit's elements in every new British film, and it seems to be true about this renewal of the franchise of the fraud, the Johnny English action comedy -- which started in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: reborn.
Will the careful self - ridicule on how bad we are will be the new opportunity for exports that the nation has?
Despite this, the face with great eyes and many grimms of the uncompetent Johnny English got a license to "twist" things for the second time - his name first means that it is a comic design with a wide range, made for the movies in places where no English is spoken.
He is certainly a sketch of a secret agent who despite his bizarre efforts to look careful after a little similar to Clouseau, he has drawings of Mr. Bin and part of the boy playing a note of the Coachie's song on the fire ceremony of the opening of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
His foundation is the traveler and the mysterious international man Atkinson who once performed in the now forgotten Barclay's TV advertisement, leaving chaos behind.
There's one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I really liked when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medium - century armor, and the rotor pairs hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somehow surfaced, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and the impossible Mission contains elements of comedy themselves.
Humour seems to be aimed at children, instead of adults, and for me, the crazy accidents of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as it's the net chaos of Bean atkinson's character.
The theme that is being kept on is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker infiltrated into the super secret network of spy spys in Britain, revealing the identity of all British agents in the field, disappointing the agent who is on duty -- disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance of a prime minister who is a pomped and fighting figure and has already suffered from a full melting of political inpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in this character of quazi-Tereza-May, but there is nothing special in the scenario that would work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling himself Johnny English who is now working as a teacher in private school, but "black" gives classes for secret agents: there are a few good boys here when English offers a school for spying that looks like rock academy.
Englez was quickly invited to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with the former colleague Bow, played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, about a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicki Pepperdin is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, to screw up all things in the Royal Secret Service, they're going back to action and meet fatally beautiful Ophelia Buletova, the guy played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the wicked Jason Walta, desperate by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow are starting their odysseum of absurd actions: made as waiters they burn a French restaurant; they're making desert after they smuggling themselves to Walta's luxury yacht; and English starts anarchy when he's trying to use a helmet for a virtual reality to get to know the inside of the Walta house.
All brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as kind and noisy, there is a lot of child television in the whole movie.
Beautiful moderate things.
And as with the other movies with Johnny English, I can't imagine: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role to use his talent?
Labourists deny that they have a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbin's Laburist Party will think about a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week - but they will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give the workers another free day.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "suits" with the economic agenda of the party and plans to make the country more favourable to workers.
The transition in a four-day working week is supported by the Sindication Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic changes.
Highly ranked party member said to Sanday Times: "The revision of the strategy should be published before the end of the year.
"It's not going to happen overnight, but a working week of four days is an endeavour that is in line with the accession of the party to rebalance the economy for workers, as well as the whole industrial strategy of the party."
The Laborist Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party has begged for a four-day working week during the parliamentary election campaign in 2017.
However, the aspiration is not accepted by the entire labour party.
The Laburist Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a strategy of the party, and the party does not consider that idea."
The Chancellor in Shadow John McDonalle used the last week's Laburist conference to present his vision of socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonalle said he was determined to grab the power of "free directors" and "profiters" in community companies.
Chancellor's plans in shadows also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get back the whole part because the labour government could make "deductions" for non-ethical behavior.
He also reaffirmed the workers' plans to become part of the company's boards and create Inclusive Property Funds, with which 10 per cent of private companies' capital will belong to employees who can take an annual dividend up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy gives a statement of 60 Minutes about whether the FBI investigation for Cavano can change its mind
The FBI investigation on Judge Brett Cavano postponed the final vote for his nomination in the Supreme Court at least one week and updated the question of whether findings of the bureau could reconsider some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In the interview published on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minuti" Scott Pelly asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could find something that would make them think about.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Caroline.
"I think so," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, uncertain."
Graham's voice, however, looks like he's screwed up in a stone.
"My decision was made for Brett Cavano and a shocking accusation is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied energy," Graham added, thinking about Christine Blacy Ford.
"Everything she has appointed could not be confirmed.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did he do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held at the Global Citizen Festival, a annual music event on which famous stars appear and has an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now held on the seventh time, and the Global Citizen festival will visit dozens of thousands of people who will come to the large grass in the central park, not only to enjoy the performance of names like Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal to put an end to extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (except if they don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), participants have to perform several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to some world leader, a telephone call or another useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal to put an end to poverty.
But how successful is the Gulbal Citizen because they remained 12 years to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to seek to take care of something or just another case of "click-activism" -- people who feel that they make a real difference by signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims that they registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters, acting for many different purposes.
They say that these activities have helped to encourage world leaders to indicate dedication and strategies that gathered over $37 billion and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and insights resulting from their activities, of which $10 billion have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the congregation funds have a direct impact of nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, Partnership of Investors and Implementators, with the headquarters in Britain, devoted to "help the children to use their potential", which promised to provide $35 million for Rwanda for help with disadvantaged food in the country after they received 4.700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of insecurity, a note in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the power of the Food, before the people gathered at the concert live in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities have been undertaken in connection with calls for improving mothers and children's nutrition in Britain, the government announced the financing of the project, the Power of the Food, which will cover 5 million women and children with internal interventions.
As an answer to one of the often asked questions on their web site "Why do you think you can put an end to extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen answered: “It will be a long and difficult road — we will never succeed.
But as well as the great civil and anti-aparthade movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Wickend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Giannell Mona are some of the artists that will perform this year's New York event, whose host will be Deborah-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the navy for the blockade to prevent Russian energy exports - the Ministry of Interior
Washington can "if necessary" use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinky discovered, as Washington Egzeminer quoted.
According to Zinky, Russia's involvement in Syria -- namely, where it acts after the invitation of a legitimate government -- is a cover for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they're in the Middle East is because of energy shopping, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
"United States have the ability, with our navy, to ensure that the seaways will remain open and if it is necessary to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinky addressed the presence of the event organised by the Energy Consumer Alliance, an unprofit group that represents itself as the "vote of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's accession in dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that he is effectively the same.
"Economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, an increase in the role and replacement of fuel," he said, while he spoke of Russia as "one uncomfortable pony" with a economy depending on fossil fuels.
The statement followed since Tramp's administration began to encourage the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replaceing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For that purpose, Tramp's officials, including the US President Donald Tramp, are trying to convince Germany to resign from the "inappropriate" project for North Tec 2, which, according to Tramp, made a "slave" of Moscow from Berlin.
Moscow has emphasized several times that the North Tec 2, which is worth $11 billion, should double the current gaswater capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is just a economic project.
Kremlj claims that Washington's firm opposition to the project is just for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to select suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after the meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American attitude faced a resistance from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leadership of the industry in Germany, the German industry Federation (BDI) urged the United States not to interfere with European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemph, the first man of the German industry Federation (BDI) after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will look carefully" whether to run for president in 2020, Senator from Massachusett
Senator from Massachusett, Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she "will consider carefully" whether to run for a president after the middle of the mandate elections.
During a meeting in the city congregation in Hollioque, Massachusett, Warren confirmed he was thinking of running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our non-functional government, which means a woman's forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether to run for the president."
Warren evaluated the work of President Donald Tramp during a meeting in the city congregation and said he "is running the country in the wrong direction.
"I am too concerned about what Donald Tramp is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is open in her criticism to Tramp and the man he nominates for a judge in the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano.
In a Twitter message on Friday, Warren said "of course we need a FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in its electoral unit think it should not be run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probably" voters from Massachusett said the senator should not be running, according to the Centre for Political Research of the University in Safolk/Bostonski Globus.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidacy.
The survey has shown more support for the nomination of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% support potential nomination, and 48% are opposed.
Other famous names from the Democratic Party discussing nomination in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Byden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associate Press.
Sarah Paylin talks about Treck Paylin's post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Tramp's meeting
Track Paylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he signed up in September.
He was arrested and accused of a domestic violence incident Monday night
"I know what my son's passing through after he returns, I know how other families feel that are broken because of the post-traumatic syndrome and wounds with which our soldiers are returning," she said before the audience to Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paylin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other military veterans "they return a little different, they return tight, they return and wonder if there is respect for what they and their aircraft companions and every other member of the army gave for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence by attacking a woman, along with a domestic violence report and possession of weapons under alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the police spokesman in Vasila.
18 federal states and Washington City support the contradiction of new asylum policy
Eighteen federal states and the city of Washington support contesting the new American policy preventing the asylum of victims fleeing from domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and the city of Washington made petition to the court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington in support of the asylum-seeker who contests the policy, reported En-Bi-Si News.
The entire name of the prosecutor in the case of Grace v. Parliament, which the American Civil Freedom Union filed in August against federal policy, was not discovered.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang," abused her, but US authorities refused her asylum request on 20 July.
She was locked in Texas.
The state defender who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many asylum demands come from in the United States as nations with persistent gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy cancels the decision of the Immigrant Appeal Board since 2014, allowing undocumented immigrants who flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The public attorney of the city of Washington Carl Rasin said on Friday that the new policy "ignored decades of the introduction of laws at the level of federal states, federal and international level".
"The Federal Law requires all asylum requirements to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a regulation violate that principle," according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
Furthermore, defenders in the letter claim that the policy preventing immigrants' entry is harmful to the US economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary labour force".
Public Prosecutor Jeff Seshns ordered judges to immigration not to give asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear for race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," Seshns said at the presentation of the policy on June 11th.
The asylum has never been designed as a solution to all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate efforts to save in Palu are made because the number of victims has doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while she comforted her male baby in the evacuation center in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Each minute, ambulance vehicles carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
Inhabitants return to their ruined homes and choose from their alleged objects to save what they can.
Thousands of people were injured, and the hospitals damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has breakers on his back and shoulder, rested in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside, due to the frequent minor earthquakes.
The tears came to his eyes when he described the strong earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was pressed in the ruins of the wall, I think so," Harris said to the Associate Press, adding that his family was in the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her kid.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accuses China of "building" with "propagand advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper announced a four-party advertising in the US daily newspaper, counting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador in China accused Peking of using US media to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Tramp spoke last Wednesday about China Daily's payable supplement in De Moin Register -- the most sales newspaper in Iowa -- after he accused China of interfering with the US convention elections on November 6th, China rejected the accusation.
Tramp's accusation that Peking is trying to interfere in US elections marked the United States Services for Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercial advertising, Peking and Washington , they are currently in a trade war in which import tariffs are balanced.
China's revenge tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were targeted to exporters from federal states like Iowa, supported by the Republican Tramp Party, confirmed by Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador in China, and former, long-year governor of Iowa, chief exporter of agricultural products in China, said that Peking hurts American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of De Moin Register, "now doubles the abuse of advertising in our free print."
"In the defemination of propaganda, the government of China abuses the emerging American tradition of free speech and free media by setting advertising in De Moin Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the nearest newspaper stadium, here in Beijing, you can find only limited numbers of opinions and you will not see the real reflection of the desperate views that the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economic trajectory, because the media are controlled by the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China rejected his announcement offer" of the column, although he did not say which newspaper is.
Republicans distant from women's votes in front of the elections in the middle of the mandate, due to Cavano debaclote, analysts warn
Since many Republicans are observing or defending Brett Cavano's nomination in the Supreme Court despite several charges of sexual attacks, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the coming elections in the middle of the mandate.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already stated that they want to continue voting.
Of such things, there is no return, "written by Grant Riher, a professor of political science at the University of Maxwell at Syracuse University, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Riher said he suspects the FBI's pressure to investigate Senator Jeff Flake (Republican of Arizona) would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow or in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, a high adviser and a national speaker of the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, outside Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators cried "November coming!" at a protest in the Senate's hall, when the Republicans, who have control in the Legal Affairs Commission, decided to continue with Cavano's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blacy Ford's testimony, Mick said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democrats will be high," Stu Rotenberg, non-party political analyst on the news site.
"The people already say they are high; that's true.
But they can be higher, especially among the independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, which, although they don't like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony has detailed its charges of sexual attack against the judge candidate in the Supreme Court, the analysts suggest that there may be negative consequences if the Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican party," said Michael Still, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to the news of En-Bi-Si.
"It is not only about the voting in the committee or the last vote or whether Cavano will go to a hearing, it is also about the way the Republicans deal with this and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities of the United States, a group that helps the election of democrats, for the news channel.
However, the Americans are divided about whom to trust after the testimony of Ford and Cavano, although a large number of people accept the first party.
The new Yu-Gov survey shows that 41 percent of the respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably trust Cavano.
Furthermore, 38 percent claimed that Cavano was likely or definitely lying in the testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently exploring the accusations made by Ford, as well as at least one other, Deborah Ramirez, Gardian said.
Ford witnessed in front of the Senate's Legal Affairs committee under oath last week that Cavano in a drunk state attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accuses the Judge's candidate at the Supreme Court showed her genitalia at a party, while they studied in Yeil in the 1980s.
World Network Inventor plans to start a new Internet to cause Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Network starts with a startup business that pretends to be a Facebook rival, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrapt, is a company built on the open code platform of Solid, Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was kidding that Inrupt's intention was "world domination".
"We must do it now," he said to the start-up business.
"Now is the historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "internet data component" or shortly the Pod.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outluck, Sleck and Spotifay are available to all of them at the same time.
What is unique to the Internet personal data storage is that only a user depends on having access to certain types of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data".
The idea of Inrapt, according to the executive director of the company, John Bruce, is to provide resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of development developers with a project and community coders volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized applications using tools available on Inrapt's web site.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to make complete changes where their business models are completely turned up overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In the media announced on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrapt mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the Consortion of the World Network of the Institute for Technology in Massachusetts.
Recently, Berners-Lee is an influenced speaker in the Internet neutrality debate.
Even when starting with Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortion, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am a great optimist for the new era of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: A Knowledged Victorian Cross from World War I
The only priest of the English Church who received the Victorian cross during the first World War as a fighter has been celebrated in his birth city for 100 years.
Colonel, honored Bernard Van received a confession on September 29, 1918 in Belengliz and Lehaukur attack.
Still, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British warmark.
The commerate stone was discovered by his two grandchildren on the Rashden parade, Northemptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was a "incredible symbol" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the denomination.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint Quentin "With a very dense fog and under a strong fire of guns and ammunition."
Later, he ran to the places where he was fired and with “the greatest courage ” he led forward, before himself attacked the top nest and disabled three of the servicemen.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's works were "something I know I will never be able to fulfill it, but it's something that makes us modest."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also put a chain after the parade led by the Brantwood Youth Empire Band.
Michael Van said he "is a great honour to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of the real hero is shown with the support given by many people."
The fans of combined fighting skills stayed awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead, Pepa Prassec
Imagine, you're awake all night watching Belator 206, without having a chance to watch the main event.
The list of San José contained 13 fights, including six with the main cards presented live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just Gerard Mussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face, the British viewers were frightened when the channel was transferred to Pepa Prasse.
Some were not impressed since they stayed awake until early hours for the fight.
One of Twitter's fans described the transfer of child drawing fill as "some painful joke."
"The law is that the content was inappropriate at 6 a.m., so it had to be transferred to a child programme," said Dave Schwartz, vice-president of the Belator for Marketing and Communication, when it was asked for the transfer.
"Peed pigs," yes"
The president of the company, Belator Scott Cooker, said they would work on a schedule that would include British watchers in the future.
"I think when I think about re-employment, I think we can probably find a solution," said Cooker.
"But there's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when we transferred, we got a lot of messages and none of them were flattered.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to deliver more for fans, and we exaggerated.
It's an unfortunate situation
Disks on an empty island: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality -- but it motivated him to be successful.
24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "all aren't like me"
Speaking of the first show of Diskovi on a desert island on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being a parent has made him less concerned about the Olympic victory.
The regular presenter of Kirstie Yang's long - year show took a multimonth vacation because of the disease.
Apparently, as a compared character in Lavern's first program, Daley said he felt "minor" than everyone else when he grew up because "It was not socially acceptable to have sympathy to boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, those feelings of lower value and diversity were things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The Olympic with two bronze medals became a famous LGBT campaign supporter and used his performance on this year's Games of the Community in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy to live openly without division and wants to give “the hope ” to others.
The three-fold world champion said about falling in love with a man-American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "Surpended me."
Dailey married the Oscar, who was 20 years old, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so many early years," he went to the first olympics of 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said "all his views" changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was related to "I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal on the Olympic.
My golden olympic medal is Robbie."
His son carries his father Robert, who died in 2011, aged 40, after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daily said his father did not accept death, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
Next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze.
"I just knew this was what I dreamed about all my life -- jumping in front of the home audience of the Olympic games, there's no better sense," he said.
This also inspired his first choice of a song — Heather Smoll’s pride — that he was in his head when he was preparing for the Olympiad and from which he was still grieving.
Disks on a desert island of BBC Radio 4 are on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michelson, he's not in shape, he was on the bench during Coop Ryder on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he's playing the 47th game of Coop Ryder, but he'll have to change the format to avoid an unfortunate turn.
Michelson, who played the binary event, recorded 12th time, was sent to the club of Captain Jim Furick during the Saturday double couples and fours.
Instead of being in the center of attention, as often represents the United States, the five-time winner, he shared time to cheer and exercise his game, in the range, with hope that he will fix what he is pushing.
He was never the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not a perfect choice for the narrow playground Le Golf Nassional, where the remote rough strikes are a regular punishment in ignorance.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Michelson, at the ninth match on Sunday, faces the precise champion of Brittish Open Francisco Molinari, who plays in a couple with the starter Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Michelson's game can be crucial.
Furick expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, touched me on his back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is part of the famous and has given a lot about these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's what we thought we had to do.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
Michelson's going to pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played games of Coop Ryder on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in Coupet Ryder where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 lost matches and seven half, even though Furick said his presence was carrying something intact in the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, sophisticated, he wants to joke with people and he's a great man at the team meetings," he explained.
"I think younger players have been having fun with him, as well as this week, which was fun to see.
He offers much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, from experience knows that a significant leadership in front of individual competitions on the last day of Coop Ryder can easily be converted into an uncomfortable position.
The Danian debited in Walderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteros had five points in front of the Americans, but "the goal line only crossed with the noses" with the least 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I remind myself that we had a great leadership in Walderama; we had a great leadership in Brooklyn, when we lost in Walderama, when we won for a little," said Bjorn, paintingly after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a lead from 10-6 Le Golf Nasinal.
Well, history will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
Go ready for tomorrow.
Get out and play right.
This is not over until the game lasts.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy, and the focus remains to it.
I keep saying, I'm focusing on 12 players in our team, but we're fully aware of the opposite side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn added satisfied with the results of his players in a difficult golf field: "I don't want to give too early scores on that issue.
The game tomorrow is a different beast.
Tomorrow, individual games are waiting for us, which is a different job.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, you test all the ability as a golf player.
That's the message to send to the players, to give everything they can tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he should do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furic will ask players to play better individually than they play in couples, exceptions are Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points of four.
Furrick himself was at the end of the last day's changes, because he was part of the victory team in Brooklyn before ending as a loser when Europe performed "The Wonder in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, united the players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the momentum goes in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure on medium games.
We set the line properly, and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to make magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to resist first and face Rory McClaroy's most important competition, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Polter in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to perform this way with the boys because I think we'll cover everything," Bjorn said about the choice in individual games.
The new German warship has been renewed
The latest freague of the German Navy was to be delivered in 2014 to replace older warships from the time of the cold war, but that will not happen until next year because of the wrong systems and prices, local media reported.
The shipship of Reinland-Faltz, the leading ship from the new class fregati Baden-Witemberg, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Di Zeit, calling on the military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problem issues after the delivery hampered the destiny of the ambitious project.
Four ships from the Baden-Witemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by the old fregats of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will contain a powerful top, a large number of anti-avionic weapons and marine missiles, as well as some stelt-technology, as a reduced radar, infrared and acustical trail.
Among other important characteristics is rare maintenance - the latest fregats should be available for up to two years from domestic ports.
Still, continuous delays mean that modern warships -- which should enable Germany to have power over the oceans -- will be already expired until they enter the ministry, Dee Zeit notes.
The fregate with an unfortunate fate F125 reached the front pages last year, when the German Navy officially refused to receive the ship and returned to the Bloom and Voss shipbuilding in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship builder after delivery.
It is a little known about the reasons for return, but German media quote a large number of key "software and hardware defects" for which the warship was useless if it was sent to a battle mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Witemberg class will have a crew of about 120 sailors -- only half of the crew of the older fregats of the Bremen class.
It also turns out that the ship is drastically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to add upgrades in the future.
"Ryneland-Faltz" weighs 7,000 tonnes and it is believed to be twice as hard as ships of similar classes used by Germany in World War II.
Besides the problem hardware, the price of the entire project -- including the training of the crew -- has also become a problem.
It is said that it has reached incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - an increase of €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest fregats are particularly important because of the warnings about the reduced naval force of Germany.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament defence committee, confirmed that the navy "was running out of ships that can be settled".
The representative said the problem has been worsening over time, because the old ships have been withdrawn from service, but there are no substitute ships.
He complained that none of the fregates from the Baden-Witemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Stretch listens to the secret life of the slippers
A new survey of property in the Scotland mountains is being conducted in order to identify how shiners use the food limit.
There is hope that discoveries will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying sycerers and will help to manage protection activities in the future.
Study of Scientists of the National Strust for Scotland will follow the ordinary and soprano-limbs, as well as brown slippers with long ears and daubenton slippers in Inverou Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the slippers during the season.
En-Aych-Es personnel and volunteers will also carry mobile research using manual detectors.
Expert analyses of sounds from all videos will determine the frequency depending on the species of slippers.
Then there will be a map of housing to create a detailed picture of their behaviour within the border.
Rob Devar, Nature Protection Adviser in En-Ty-Es, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of living are the most important for the slippers and how each of the species is used.
These information will help to determine the benefits of the management of the livelihoods, such as the creation of leathers and how best to maintain forests for slippers and other connected species.
The population of slippers in Scotland and Britain has significantly decreased in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect the beds and the loss of the livestock.
The winds and lights are also risky, as well as the sticky flies tapes and some chemical treatments on construction materials, as well as the attacks of cats.
The slippers are not really blind.
However, because of their habits of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a capture.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to find insects and obstacles in the flying path.
An-T-Es, who cares about more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of the country in the country, takes the slippers very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, inspections on beds, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even establishes the first and only reservation for slippers in Scotland of the Triv property in Damfris and Gallowey, which is a home of eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
The real estate manager David Thompson says the property is a perfect territory for them.
"We have a great area for slippers here in Triv," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good housings.
But there's a lot of strange things about the slippers, so the work we're doing here and on other property will help us learn more about what they need to make progress."
He emphasizes that it is important to check that there are slippers before renovations of property because unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and infants, and destroy the entire local population.
The slippers are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official in the Trust for the Protection of Stumps, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still need to learn a lot about the slippers and the other species, we simply don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo rejected rape charges, and lawyers will sue German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo called the accusations of raping "fake news", and added that people "willing to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which announced the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Yuventus was accused of raping an American, named Catherine Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $3,75,000 to stop talking about the incident, said Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on a live video in Instagram of its 142 million followers, a few hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, rejected reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was presented today is fake news," the five-fold winner of the gold ball said before his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but it's part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for accusations, which they called "inadmissible transfer of suspicions of private life," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Sherc said the player would seek damage for "moral damage next to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident subjected to accusations occurred in June 2009 in the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After they met at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her analytically, according to the documents submitted to the court in Clarke area in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" "good boy," but he dropped under that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but there was a consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and pictures were made of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to a treaty without judicial involvement because she was afraid of revenge" and was concerned that "she would be publicly embarrassed".
The 34-year-old says now demands a change in the contract because there are traumas of the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer moved to the Italian giant Yuventus with an agreement worth 100m euros.
Braggsit: Britain will always regret the loss of car manufacturers
Britain "will always regret" if he loses the status of a world leader in car production after Bragzit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "embarrassing" what Toyota-Brithania reported to Bi-Bi-Si that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production in the Burnastone factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
Japanese car manufacturer reported that the impact of border delays in the case of Bragzit without an agreement would cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, produced by Toyota Auris and Auensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think, if Britain left the EU at the end of March, there will be a cease-of-production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnastone.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about how cross-border trade will work in the EU without agreement, including Honda, Be-Em-Ve and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-Em-We, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Braggsit.
The main concerns are linked to what car manufacturers call risks on the logistic chain in the case of Bragzit without agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the "right in time", while parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a breakdown on the border which, according to the industry, can cause delays and shortcomings of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily inventory in the Derbishire factory, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "to avoid such border checks".
"We should have a deal. We need to have the best agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the present, but to grab this opportunity," he said to today's Radio 4 program on Bi-Bi-Si.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also other producers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistic chains."
Toyota couldn't tell how long would the production be stopped, but long-termly warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and cost jobs.
Peter Cularis, who has worked in Burnastone for 24 years and has been a representative of the union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “It is my experience, as soon as those jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to a government speaker: "We have made a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Tramp's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, reports White House
The important meeting of Donald Tramp with Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "revoked for another week" because the fight against Brett Cavano's nomination for judge in the Supreme Court, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special advisor Robert Muller, investigating the Russian intervention in the elections, the links between Tramp and Russia's assistants and the potential violation of the laws by the President.
Whether Tramp will fire the Deputy Public Prosecutor and thus threaten Miller's independence, encourages talks in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times announced that Rosenstein was thinking of carrying a video machine with Tramp and the possibility of eliminating the president over the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denyed the report.
But by publishing reports last Monday, he went to the White House with intention to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Tramp was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the time at the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said "I wouldn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a conflict in the hearing of the Senate's Committee on Justice, in which Cavano and one of the women who were accused of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blacey Ford.
On Friday, Tramp issued a one-week investigation order by the FBI on Cavano's lawsuits, which would further delay the vote in the Senate.
The Tramp Sara Sanders press secretary appeared at Fox News Sunday.
At the question of the meeting with Rosenstein, she answered: “The date for the meeting is still not established, it could be held this week, and it could also be delayed for another week, in view of all the things that are going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things will happen, and I'm always trying to keep the press informed properly."
Some journalists contested the claim: Sanders had not held a briefing for journalists in the White House of September 10th.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of briefings did not due to the inclination of the "great influence" of TV journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She subsequently suggested that direct contact between Tramp and the media would increase.
"The President organizes more sessions on questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding without specifying evidence: "We have examined those figures."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this more often, and you're witnessing that we've been doing it all the time over the last few weeks, and the talks with the President of the United States will replace briefings for journalists."
Tramp regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences in visiting high officials.
Rarely participates in single press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why it is so with his uncontrolled and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the collected journalists.
Welfare Secretary to EU workers employed in the Scotland National Health System on the fears related to Bragzit
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in the Scotland National Health System, expressing the country's gratitude and the wish that they remain after Bragzit.
Gene Freeman, an MP to the Scotland Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was withdrawn from the EU.
The Scotland government has already committed to cover the cost of resolved applications for EU citizens working in public services at a lower level.
Mrs. Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU for retreat continued during the summer, with a view to making the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government has also intensified preparations for the possibility of not reaching an agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the workshop, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from all the EU and broaderly share precious experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and are useful for patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Cristian Abercromby is subject to an emergency surgery after the head injury
Cristian Abercromby, the Defensive Player (Linebecker) of Tennessee State Tigers was subjected to an emergency surgery after the head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Teнеси Authority.
Rod Reed, Chief Coach of Tennessee State, told the journalists that the injury occurred just before the half-time.
"He came to the sideline on the playground and just strapped on the country," Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave oxygen to Abercromby outside the playground, then put him in the weapons and took him to further evaluation.
The official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Neshville, Tennessee, that Abercromby was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the species/degree of injury" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually happened.
Abecromby is a second year student and plays his first season in red dress in Tennessee State after transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five discounts on Saturday before he left the game, which resulted in 18 collapsings this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless persons
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's attempt to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Ministry expects this move to gather up to 120 million pounds a year, funds to be used for helping homeless people
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless persons.
This move will be considered as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide accessories and focus on people with high earnings.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom, while additional funds will strengthen the Government's efforts to improve the situation with homeless persons.
The additional amount, which in addition to the current administrative fee, includes higher levels that have been introduced two years ago for a second home and a purchase of property with a purpose to rent it can reach up to three per cent.
The Ministry expects this move to gather up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built property in London were purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, which led to increased prices and caused difficulties for those who buy property for the first time to join in this process of buying household property.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was published only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction firms of offering high prices to land retain, but did not use it and asked Mrs. May to change the quotas for access homes in order to fix the "conciliation situation with home" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive home reforms, including rental controls and ending expulsions without justified reasons.
He also wants advice to give greater powers to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “Later I said that I would devote my prime ministership to the return of the British dream, or life to be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open for people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies can buy homes as easy as worthy British residents.
The dream of owning his own home for many people has become too far away, and the humiliation of homeless persons is too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland."
Jack Ross, Sunderland's head, said his "final ambition" is in the future to become the manager of the National Club of Scotland.
The Scotchman, 42, enjoys the challenge to resurrect the Northeast club, which is currently in the third place in the first league with only three points less than the top club.
This summer he moved to the St. Mirren Stadium after they returned to the Scottish Prime Minister's League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told Scotland Sportsound of BBC.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in "Hampden" with my father and always dragging me back.
However, such a possibility I could only get if I was successful in managing the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as the Sunderland managers are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Poet and Paulo De Kanio.
Former head of Alloa Athletic said he had not felt any disturbance knowing that he should follow such fixed names in such a big club, since he had previously rejected Barnsley's offers and Ipswich Town.
"My success is now assessed by "can I bring this club back to the Premier League?"
Given the structure and objects in this club, he certainly belongs to the Prime Minister League," he said.
"It's not a easy task to bring this club there, but I'm probably going to think that I have achieved success here only if I bring the club back there."
Ross is only a manager for three years, in which his career came into after working as the boss in Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of Hearts' training staff.
Then helped Alloa recover from the third League and restored St. Mirren from the edge of the loss of the title in the Prime Ministership in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played in "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academical".
"That was probably a real crossroad for me," he recalls the receipt of "Alloa".
"I honestly believed that career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing good, making enough money and enjoying certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There's a lot of things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in the role of the manager.
I've always wanted to be the manager, and now I'm doing it, in this role, I feel more comfortable than ever during my adult life."

According to a study, the perfect beer time is at 17:30 a.m. Saturday.
The summer warm wave led to an increase in the profits of British pubs which are currently in a very difficult situation, but have put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars noticed a increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, but the profit of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin from the CGA Company for Business Consultative Services in Determining these figures said: "The suntime and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Championship meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profits of pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, and the restaurants dramatically decreased.
The fall in sales of 1.8 per cent of restaurants in June has even worsened during July.
The pubs and bars that are mostly selling drinks have noticed a much higher increase in comparison with the previous years in contrast to restaurants where decline was observed.
The pubs that mostly sell food were also badly affected by the sun times, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, drink sales increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, and food sales by only three per cent.
Paul Newman, a vacation and hospitality analyst from RSM, said: "This results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sports events remain the most important factors in the sale of the market outside of home.
It is not a surprise that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although 4.8 per cent of sales in a year will be particularly more exciting as supplementary to current pressures produced by the costs.
The long warm summer could not arrive at a worse time for local owners who are mostly selling food and the weather will show whether the moderate temperatures we had in August will provide much needed breathing."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openers, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the delay in the publication of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker's tracking device for monitoring the sale in the pab sector, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom collects and analyses data on the efficiency of the 47 operational groups with a combined income of over 9 billion pounds and represents a fixed rapper for the industry.
One of the five children has a secret profile of social media that he hides from his parents
A study showed that one of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have a secret profile of social media that he hides from his parents and teachers
Research included 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "fake Instagram" profiles
The news raised fear that such profiles are published by sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had one "head" profile that they showed to their parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates a social media profile that he hides from adults.
The research included 20,000 high schools showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" profiles, a shortcut for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news raised the fear that such profiles have been published by sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clear "head" profile that they showed to their parents, while they had other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter on the same ran into a teenager who asked others to "force him."
The study carried out by the Digital Awareness of the UK and the Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them is secret.
The chief of HMC Mike Buchanan said: "It is really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Ellid Doyle will be the "sports vote" of the Scottish Athletics board
Ellid Doyle was elected to be an inexecutive director of the Scottish Athletics committee at the annual general meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most excellent athletic in Scotland and President Ian Beathy described the move as an excellent opportunity for those part of the leadership in this sport to use its broad experience at the international level gained during the past decade.
"All in the Scotland, British and World Athletic Community have great respect for Elid and we are sure that the sportsmen in Scotland would have great benefits if it become a member of the committee," Bitty said.
Doyle said: “I am ready to be the voice of sportsmen, and I hope I can really contribute to the right direction of sports in Scotland.”
The American who won the titles of 200 and 400 meters of the Games in Atlanta in 1996, along with the total four gold medals on the Olympic Games, which now appears regularly as a BBC commentator, could not go after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote to Twitter: “A month ago, I got a brain attack.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would show me whether to recover or to what extent.
The whole process was miserable, but I managed to recover completely, and I can go and practice for aggression again!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump advertisement in which mothers are compared with cows caused a division of Internet opinions
A breast pump company has caused a division of Internet opinions when it announces a advertising in which breast-feeding mothers are compared to cows slipping.
In order to note the launching of the product which is said to be the "the quietest breast pump in the world", the user-oriented Technology Company Elvie announced a funny advertising inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who breast.
Four mothers dance in a stove full of cows, which sounds like "Yes, I'm slipping milk, but you don't see the tail" and "If you haven't noticed this, these are my chests."
The refren continues: "Pump, pump, feed, feed, pump, pump, slip my chest."
However, the advertising published by the Facebook company's website has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, while many have said it stresses the "strain" of the milk industry.
"It is a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, should be pregnant and born so they can produce milk, except that their children are stealing from them only a few days after they are born," said one of the comments.
Elvie's breast pump is discreetly fitted into the breastbrush ("Elvie"/ "Mother")
Another comment states: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers keeping their babies?"
Someone added: “Really inappropriate advertising. ”
Others, however, defended the advertising, and one woman admitted that the song was really “funny. ”
"I think this idea is brilliant.
I'd have bought a pump like this if I still had.
It made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a genius product," one of the comments said.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad for mothers who slip milk (often in their workplace or toilets) and feel like “cows. ”
This is not a advertising that fails or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they were dancing while discreet pumps were wearing in their pants.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely quiet, no wire, no pipes, and discreetly fits in the breast garment, giving women freedom to move, keep their babies, or even leave home while they slide milk.
Anna Balarin, partner and RDR in "Mother" commented: "Elvie's pump is a really revolutionary product and deserves a brave and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who slip milk and milk cows, we wanted to slip milk through pump and challenges that bring the same to the center of attention, showing the amazing sense of freedom that the new pump is carrying in a funny and closer way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump to be present in all titles.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion track for the designer Martha Yakubowski carrying the product.
Thousands of children migrants moved quietly to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrants in detention has increased significantly, although the crossing of the monthly border remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the fact that the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by Tramp's administration have made the accommodation of children in sponsors.
Traditionally seen, most sponsors themselves were unrecognized immigrants and were afraid of threatening their own stay in the country if they asked them to be a child sponsor.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to bear fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a high immigration and customs official last week witnessed before the Congress that the Agency arrested dozens of people who applied for a minor sponsorship without an escort.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of arrested persons had no previous criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the family of sponsors are illegally staying in the country and many of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That's why we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albens said.
In order for children to process faster, the authorities have introduced new rules in accordance with which some of them will be requested to appear in court within a month of detention, not within 60 days, as the shelter workers say there was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not personally, in order to present their legal status case before the immigration judge.
Those who are considered inappropriate for relief will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, that can lead to violent expades or escape attempts, say shelter workers and reports that have appeared from the system in the past few months.
Advocates say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Thornilo, where there is more likely to be ignored signs that the child faces difficulties because of its size.
They added that moving children into the tent city without providing enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could increase traumas that most of them are already facing.
Syria told US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In its address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted eight years.
Mualem who also performs the Deputy Prime Minister's function said foreign forces were illegally staying on Syrian territory under an excuse to participate in the fight against terrorism and "will be treated appropriately."
"They must withdraw immediately without setting conditions," he said to the congregation.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost completed" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to lead this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Basar al-Asad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Mualem said the conditions are good to return and accuse "some of the Western countries" of "expanding irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We invited the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicize the issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with renewable assistance until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
UN diplomats said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for setting a tampon-zone in the last large rebellion rebellion in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province where three million people live.
However, Muallem stressed that the treaty had "jasné deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be directed towards dżihadists, including fighters from Nusra Front related to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eliminated".
UN representative Stefan de Mistura hopes to summon the first meetings of the new committee composed of government members and opposition in order to prepare a positioned constitution for Syria and open the road to the elections.
Muallem established the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "review of members of the current constitution," and warned about the consequences of further mixing in the same.
Why Tramp won the second mandate
According to that logic, Mr. Tramp will win the elections again in 2020 unless the impeachment and scandal in advance cease his presidential mandate, which is likely a majority of liberalists.
In what will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final in presidency that has ever been seen! ”
From now on, there are no signs of tiredness in the watchers.
Since 2014, the impact time rating increased more than double and reached 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled and reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nilsen says "Fox News" in average has 2.4 million strike-time viewers, which is 1.7 million more in comparison with the period four years ago, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" of "MSNBC" reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in the evening when important news are announced.
"This is like a fire to which people feel attracted because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the main TV producer of the Designed Survivor drama of the ABC for the office secretary who becomes president after Capitol was destroyed by attack.
Nell Skovel, veteran in writing comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," there is another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her she'd vote for Mr. Tramp.
She asked why.
"He answered, "Because I think he's really funny," Mrs. Scowell said to me.
There is also a certain fun value in the whole chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can define the future of Roe's case against Wade, whether immigrant families will be able to reunit, as well as the well as the well-being of the global economy.
Exclusion of all this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an informed citizen when you see a panel of experts who debate the use of the source of the "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his "Fear" book, a bomber of the skin jacket of Paul Manafort of $15,000 (the clothing with thick arrogance," as he called "The Washington Post" and the implications of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Tramp's anatomy by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never be able to watch Super Mario in the same way.
"The part of what he's doing and which makes you feel like watching reality show is that every night brings you something new," says Brent Montgomery, the chief Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creation of the Pawn Stars for the turning team of the Tramp show and the daily turnovers (the NFL carriers, commendation for Kim Yong-un).
You can't afford to miss any episode because then you won't be able to compensate.
When I visited Mr. Flace this week, it was sunny, and the temperature was 80 degrees away from his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watching MSNBC while he was filming on CNN.
He could not stop seeing, at least not when Brett Cavano was to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical state.
"I remember we were doing all those crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the west civilization." Mr. Flace said to me.
"I thought it was some joke, but it turned out that they were right."

External Inflammation in the Nearest Mediterranean elections in the Upper House Race
It is not surprising that the 17th Congress Area in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funds thanks to the reorganization of the conventional areas from which two candidates in the race for the same place.
For this recent renovated pregradary area in Pittsburgh, a representative of democrats Conor Lamb is running, who has received a seat in another area of extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Kit Rothfus, who presents the old 12th Congress Area, which is largely crossing with the new 17th convention area.
Maps have been modified since the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that old areas have been manipulated in favour of the Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th Congress area is a difficult competition to finance campaigns among the main parties sponsorships, the Congress Committee for campaigns of the Democratic Party ("DCCC") and the National campaign committee of the Republican Party ("NRCC").
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after the narrow victory in the extraordinary elections for the 18th Congress Area in Pennsylvania held in March, which characterized wide media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place was taken by the Republican, and President Donald Tramp won the area with 20 points.
Political experts give little privilege to the democrats.
The United States decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then quit
The diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing under a small pressure by Washington.
Mr. Tramp had a friendly meeting in June 2017 with President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Tramp's management team.
State department officials decided to withdraw US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on "new decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said Heather Nauert, speaker of the State Department in the statement she gave at the beginning of this month.
However, El Salvador was only taken into account the penalties, which received US aid of approximately $140m in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial assistance and the target visa restrictions, would have a harmful impact on the country in Central America and the high rates of unemployment and murders in it.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
By mid-September, however, High Administrative Representatives stressed that they wanted the conference to progress and in an effective way to put an end to every thinking about the punishment of El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pens should address a conference scheduled for the mid-October as a sign of the importance that the administration assigns to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news about heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal thinking about the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who is close to the administration and has also spoken about the state of anonymity.
Learn History
The next thing that can happen is to announce the report of Special Adviser Robert Miller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Tramp, which is now a very strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller has reportedly also directed his investigation to the fact that Mr. Tramp's campaign is connected to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of the Congress has changed, Mr. Tramp will have to bear responsibility in that body while preparing to appear again before the voters, perhaps even before the jury composed of his colleagues.
There are many insecurities here and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor his colleagues in Europe.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that will affect the duration of this fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to strike Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaci in Minhen.
We failed, and we missed the possibility of avoiding the years of the massacre that followed.
The history flows around such points of change and the unstoppable democracy march is accelerating or delaying.
The Americans are now facing several such points of change.
What if Mr. Tramp resigned the Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein's on the hot chair since this newspaper announced that he proposed to take a secret recording of the president last year and speculated that he was inappropriate for the function he performed.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in the Times is incorrect.
"What will we do if Brett Cavano's new investigation requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence to the Supreme Court despite the reliable charges of sexual attack and false testimony?
And first of all, will we vote for a Congress that will accuse Mr. Tramp?
If we fall on all these tests, democracy's waiting for a long winter.
But I believe that this would not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that ever occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to burn candles for Saturday at a table with a swastique logo.
With such inheritance, how can I not be optimistic for the future?"

Graham Dorants from Rangers with optimistic attitudes in front of the Rapid Vienna conflict
Rangers are hosts of the Rapid Vienna conflict on Thursday, while they are aware of the fact that after the played unresolved game against "Villarreal" in Spain at the beginning of this month, the victory of the Austrians will strengthen their position to be qualified in Group G in the League of Europe.
Graham Dorens, the middle-line player due to knee injury, was prevented from showing up in the season until the unresolved game of 2-2 with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a leaking board for greater achievements.
"That was a good point for us because "Villarreal" is a good opponent," a 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game, believeing that we can achieve something and returned with a winning point.
Maybe we could have given a little more at the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half of time, and we did our best in the second half - time and we were better.
On Thursday, we are waiting for another big European night.
I hope we'll win three points, but it'll be a hard game because they've had good results in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the cheerleaders, we'll return and get a positive result.
Last year, it was definitely a difficult year, in view of everything that happened, my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy; training is good.
I hope we can go forward now, leave last season behind us and achieve success."
Women can't sleep at night because of this fear associated with retirement savings
Although the research participants had a clear idea of how they want to be taken care of, few talked to their family about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by the Nationalweed said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they do not take steps to discuss the same," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Nationwide life insurance company.
Here's where you're supposed to start.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not share your desires with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how you can get care because such elections can be a significant factor in the determination of costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your choices to finance long-term care can include a traditional policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash, which can help you cover the costs or provide self-insurance with your own funds, if you have them.
Take care of your legal documents: Avoid the legal battles at the beginning.
Extract authorized health care so that you can authorize a person with confidence to supervise your medical care and ensure that health professionals respect your desires if you are not able to communicate.
Think also about your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose a person with confidence to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your accounts if you are not able to do so yourself.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your older parents need urgent medical care and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about the drugs he drinks and his allergies?
Please note these details in writing to be prepared.

A man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while he was coming home from the exit.
The victim of about 40 years of age was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracomb when he was shot in his chest, his stomach, and his hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which happened around 2:30 BST (British summer time) as "a random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not dangerous in life, and the police appeal to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a strong earthquake and tsunami hit by the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials reported, expecting to increase the number of victims.
Because of the interruption of communications, the aid person cannot get information from the county Dongala, a region northern from Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a strength of 7.5 degrees.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
A few key facts on Palu and Dongala, on Sulavezi Island:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulavesi province, which is at the end of the west coast of Sulavezi, with estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and the tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches over 300 miles (180 miles) on the coast in the northwestern part of Sulavesi Island.
The district, which represents the administrative region within the province, had estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are main sources of income for the province Central Sulavesi economy, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The nicle pulling is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morvali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
The Indonesian disaster mitigation agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
The tsunami also hit the West Dongala in 1996, and nine people died.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific ring of the fire and regularly affects earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province Acheh in northern Sumatra on December 26, caused tsunami hit in 14 countries, with 226,000 people killed along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them were the inhabitants of Acheh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8 degrees earthquake hit the South of Java, the most inhabited island in Indonesia, causing tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, and nearly 700 people died.
2009: A landquake of 7.6 degrees hit the area near Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7,5 degrees hit one of the Mentavian islands near Sumatra, causing tsunami that reached up to 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, and about 300 people died.
2016: Agriculture with filthy focus hit the district Piddy Jaya in Achech, causing desolation and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the earthquake didn't cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Lomboc tourist island in Indonesia, with more than 500 people killed, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stuck.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son arrested for family violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and the vice president candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested for attack charges.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Aljaska, was arrested under suspicion of family violence, interference in family violence report and resistance of arrest, according to the report published on Saturday by police officers in Aljaska.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in the detention institution Matt-Su with an opportunity to exit if she pays $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday he appeared in court, where he said he was "decisively innocent" when he was asked how he was said before the court, the network said.
Palin is facing three A-class violations, which means he could be sentenced to a prison sentence for up to a year and a penalty of $250,000.
He is also accused of a B-class violation, punishment with a day of prison and a $2,000 penalty.
This is not the first time to file criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother Sarah Palin called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case in front of the veteran court of Alaska is ongoing.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic attacks, mixing in the family violence criminal report and possession of alcoholic weapons on the incident.
His girlfriend said he reportedly hit her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticised by the veteran groups in 2016, after she said her son's violent behaviour came from PTSN, resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake hit the Indonesian island Sulavezi on Friday.
The 7.5 degrees earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric energy and communication networks are stopped, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the next days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Sulavesi, located north-east of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
Social media circulate videos that show the moment of strike.
Thousands of people gathered together for the beach festival in Palu when tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death sentence for Sifulo Saipov, a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died, a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck on the Home Depot to attack a bikeway on the West Side highway in lower Manhattan, and to cross the walkers and bikeists who were on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious body injuries, according to the report on the intention of demanding death penalty delivered to the Southern County of New York.
According to the judicial documents, there is a possibility to sentence death after both of these grounds of the prosecution act.
Several weeks after the attack, the Federal Large Jury filed a charge against Saipov 22 grounds, including eight charges for murder for the purposes of racketing, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in the cases of organised crime, as well as the charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack was required "detail planning and intentions," the prosecutors said, while the way Saipov executed it described it as "grozsive, cruel and perverted".
"Sifulo Habibulovic Saipov caused, injuries, damage and loss of families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, En-Lore Decatt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlius, Hernan Feruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho," stated the State's intention report.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since a death sentence was prosecuted in the Southern County in New York.
The accused, Calid Barnes was sentenced to murder two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to a lifetime prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who was executed after being convicted to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to a death penalty with an electric chair on June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has not shown regret in the days and months followed after the attack, according to judicial documents.
The police reported that he told the investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
The police also announced that he asked for the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent for all 22 foundations of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov said they were "approximately disappointed" by the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to seek death punishment rather than accept a confession for guilt and to sentence a lifetime prison punishment without the possibility of release will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved in the same," Patton said.
Saipov's defense has previously asked prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
Deputy from the Tori Party says NAJEL FARRAŽ should be responsible for Bregzit's negotiations
Nigel Faraz promised to "mobilize the People's Army" during the protest of the Tori Party's conference today.
Former leader of the Ukip Party said politicians must "feel the heat" of the European sceptics, with one of Teresa May's MPs suggesting that he be responsible for EU negotiations.
Conservative supporter Peter Bon on the Birmingham march said the United Kingdom would have "besides the EU" by now if Mr. Faraż was a secretary for Bragzit.
However, the challenge facing Ms. May in connection with the merger of her deeply divided members was stressed by the contra-Bregzit members of the Tori party who joined in a special protest against Bragzit held in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to continue implementation of the Checkers plan despite the attacks of pro-Bregzit persons, counter-Bragzit persons and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite strong reactions and will force Eurosceptics and members of the Labour Party to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bon said to the Pro-Bregzit meeting "Leave Means Leave" in Solihal that he wanted to "reject the Checkers plan".
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should be involved and that he should be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for negotiations, we would have been out of the EU by now," he said.
The Deputy of Wellingborough added: “I will support Braggsit, but we must reject the Checkers plan. ”
Speaking of his position against the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subjected now.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected the suggestions that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to remain in the EU is completely incorrect."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tori and Pro-Bregzit party, also attended the march and said to the journalists: "I just say, "Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Checkers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who go out on the streets and who are due to our victory of elections.
Please quit the Checkers plan and start listening to us."
In a direct message to Ms. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraz said that politicians must "sense the heat" if they intend to give up the decision taken to the referendum in 2016.
"This is now a question of trust between us, people and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Braggsit, and we are here today to tell them that "we won't let you get away with it."
In a message to the excited crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the edge to betray Bragzit, to feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has given us a victory in Bregzit and which will not stop until we become independent, self-government and proud of the United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the contra-Bregzit people marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
After the group's meeting, a few activists showed up this weekend carrying banners with the sign "Torians against Braggsit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Laburist Party, ridiculed the conservatives of security issues facing the opening of the conference on the application created by the party.
"These are people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all necessary technologies for Canada plus, for a border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is nothing called good Bragzit," he added.
Warren plans to think well about running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says "will think well about running for president" after the November elections.
"Boston Globe" announced that the representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts was talking about its future during the city congregation in Western Massachusetts this Saturday.

She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Tramp in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Hollioque was her 36th meeting with the voters since Tramp arrived in the presidential function, in which maintaining uses the city congregation format.
One of the attendants asked her whether she plans to run for the president.
Warren answered that it is time "wife to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which includes putting a woman on top."
Arrested the suspect of the case of the shooting and the death of the basketballman Simms from the LSU team
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that the suspect of the shooting and the death of Wade Simms from the LSU team that happened on Friday was arrested.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Diteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man from the video.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms had a shot wound in the head and as a result of it died," Murphy J. Paul police chief told the media on Saturday, announced "247sports".
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he was present at the crime scene, possessed weapons, and that he shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and detained at the police department of the Eastern Baton Rouge.

Gran Pri to Russia: Louis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with its orders provided him with the victory of Sebastian Vetel
Since Saturday Walter Botas qualified before Louis Hamilton became clear that Mercedes' commands would play a great role in the race.
From the semi-pool Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the cedillo while he defended his position in the first two circles and invited the Vétel to attack his companion.
The promise came first to the box and let Hamilton fight the riot at the end of the group, something that was supposed to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the box one circle later and came behind Vetel, but Hamilton went forward after the action of one to force Ferrari's driver unwillingly to leave the inside of his free risk to stay on the side after the double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstapen began from the rear line of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in the seventh place.
Then he led to the majority of the race and directed the tires of his car to reach the finish quickly and to overcome Kimmy Raiconen, taking the fourth place.
He eventually entered the box of the 44th round, but couldn't increase the rate in the remaining eight circles, so Raiconen came to the fourth place.
It's a hard day today because Walters did a great job all weekend and was a gentleman who let me go.
The team made a really exceptional decision to have its couple in the race," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Tramp laughed at the Saturday meeting on her insisting that she had not published a letter from Christine Blacy Ford accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano of sexual attack.
In his speech at the west Virginia meeting, the president did not refer directly to the testimony of Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is going on in the Senate showed that people were "wretched and dishonest and dishonest."
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's happening in the last few days in the Senate, you can see anger, people who are angry and wicked and unreasonable and unfair," he said.
"When you see announcements and flows of information and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diana Finnstein, did you post this information?
You remember her answer... did you publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't announce it."
Wait a minute then.
Did we announce it... no, we didn't announce it," he added, imitating the senator.
Finnstein was sent to a letter of information on Cavano accusations by Ford in July, and it was announced in early September, but Phinene denyed that the proliferation of information came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's indications, I did not publish her story," Finnstein said before the committee, announced "The Hill".
"She asked me to keep them confidential, and I did what he asked."
But it seems that the president did not believe her denial, so he commented on the same meeting on Saturday: “I will tell you one thing, it was a really bad body speech.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that democrats use allegations to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to restore the power in any way.
You can see their violentness, cruelty, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they need to shock to restore their power and control," the president said, as he announced, "Mediaite."

Flying Controller died helping hundreds of people in the plane to save themselves from the earthquake
The flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he died helping a plane with hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people died, and many disappeared after the great earthquake hit the Sulavezi island on Friday, causing tsunami.
Strong sequential earthquakes continue to desolate the area, and many are stuck in the ruins in Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled to save their own life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave the position at the control tower at Mutiara Sis al-Juffrey airport in Palu, which was constantly sneaking.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air plane with a flight number 6321 that was at that time on the flight will fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower at the moment he thought the tower was blowing down.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Ballicpapan to Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital to another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands of persons, the disaster mitigation agency says access to the towns of Dongala, Siggy and Boothong is limited.
"The number of victims is believed to rise because many bodies are still under ruins, while many cannot even access," the spokesman of the Sutopo Purvo Nugroho Agency said.
The waves that reached up to six meters devastated Palu, where the mass funeral would be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry help and supplies.
Risa Kusumma, 35-year-old mother said about Sky News: "The quick help brings bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Minimarkets are robbed everywhere."
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and ordered the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, and more than 550 people died.
A plane accident in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now say a man disappeared after the fall of the laguna plane
The airline that operated with the plane that fell into the Pacific in Micronesia now says a man disappeared after he said that the 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated by the tone aircraft.
Air Niugini said they can't find the man's passenger from Saturday afternoon.
The airline said he worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not answer immediately requests for more details for the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Cheek Island airport.
Officials reported on Friday that seven were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and they were all in stable condition.
The reason for the accident, as well as the correct order of events, remains unjastionable.
The airline and the American Navy reported that the plane hit the lagoon near the road.
Some witnesses thought that the plane missed the road.
American passenger Bill Janes said that the plane flyed very low.
"It's an extremely good thing," Janes said.
Janes said that he and others managed to cross the water that reached halfway and headed to the emergency exits of the tone aircraft.
He said that the stewardess were in panic and screamed, as well as that he suffered a smaller head injury.
The American Navy announced that the sailors working near the reconstruction of the port also helped to rescue by means of a boat of suffocating the people on the coast before the plane drowned at about 30 feet (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people died in accidents of airlines registered in PNG in the last two decades, but no airline Air Niugini included.
The analyst established the time frame of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of a man who was accused that a woman in Mississippi burned her alive in 2014.
Paul Rovlet, an analyst from the United States Ministry of Justice, witnessed hours as a witch in the field of intelligence analysis.
He emphasized the jury that he used phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old Queenton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received data on the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, the Clarion Ledger reported.
When on the basis of the data was shown that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was interrogated on Saturday and witnessed that day he was not in town.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth saying he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistent was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show that they only knew one week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the messages and calls from Chambers, as well as its contact information from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later the same day.

Artists like "The Fugees" and "Common" have recently experienced their recovery through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?
New York Nanny sued a couple because she was fired after sending a "racist" message
The nanny from New York sued a couple because she was fired on the basis of discrimination after she was mistakenly received a message from a mother complaining about the fact that she was “a still a black woman. ”
The marriage couple denies that they are racists, saying that the lawsuit is actually "extortion."
Lyncy Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of the new career Giselle Morris found out she was black.
"Not another nigger," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in the message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, and that twice.
After she realized what Plasco-Flaxman actually did, feeling "discomfortable" she fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, afro-American, had been doing a bad job and that instead she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines, published "New York Post".
Ms. Morris was paid for the first day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Maurice sues the marriage couple and asks for a compensation for discharge of $350 a day in a period of six months, an engagement that involves living with the family, what it originally had been engaged, but without making up an agreement.
"I want to show them that such things should not be done," she said to "Post" on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the lawsuits that they were racist, saying that dismissing Ms. Morris was a reasonable procedure because they feared that they could no longer trust her after she was insulted.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco's husband said for "Post".
"But would you trust your children in a person to whom you were rude, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Saying that the lawsuit is "extortion", Plasco said his wife had only two months ago and was in "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still in progress, the public immediately condemned the social media couple, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's publishers fear that readers will not be able to connect to a bear speaking, revealed in the new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said about the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of Paddington.
After saying that her father who worked as a camera for "BBC" before getting inspired to write a book from a little toy in a form of a bear, he would still be optimistic if his work was not well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Paddington, which she described as “very important member of our family, ” she adds that her father felt silent pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and didn't even want to brag," she said.
"But because you felt "Paddington" so real, it was almost like having a child who has achieved something in life: and you are proud of it, even though success is not due to you.
I think the success of Paddington was in this way.
Although it was about creation and the fruit of his fantasy, he always had the credit to himself Paddington.
My daughter was on a mortal bed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nica, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nada called me regularly to tell me that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that it will not survive," Mrs. Eden-Laperuz said.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, “Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medicinal products that the doctors gave to maintain the pumping of her heart slowly decreased, and they came out of her system.
She died before, and this meant that all her systems canceled.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this is going on.
I couldn’t scream, cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to stay safe."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, unconscious of the difficult situation she was passing through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down, and the tears didn't stop.
It's hard to explain, but when I was in the plane, I felt incredibly compassionate about Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Unfortunate women put cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys set cards on the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, living in Lidney, says her son had a great potential to become a cook, as well as an infectious smile.
"Everyone remembered him by his smile.
People always said that his smile could light every room."
However, he quit his work before he died because he was “in a really dark place. ”
His 11 - year - old brother was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I constantly fear that it will have a consistent effect."
Ms. Davis makes cards "to give others to know that there are people outside who can be contacted and with whom they can talk, even if it is about a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Humphreys, who's a long-year friend of Mrs. Davis lost her partner Mark who was married 15 years after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, or said nothing," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behaviour.
He reached the bottom of the Christmas day when the children opened their gifts, and he did not even look them into the eyes and establish no contact with them."
She said that his death was a huge trauma for all of them, but they must find a way to go through it: “That kind of thing ruins the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we must move on and fight."

Brett Cavano's future is uncertain since the FBI started the investigation.
"I thought if we could actually get something similar to what he asked, or a limited time investigation, with a limited range, we might be able to achieve a small unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee is "depleted" under the incorrect party-out condition.
Why did Cavano and his supporters from the Republican Party not want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is due only to the timing.
The medium-term elections should only be held in a few weeks, or on November 6th, and if the Republicans are expected to fail, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to be elected by their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavano who worked at Mr. Bush's White House and through which he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are 51 Republicans and 49 democrats at the moment.
It's still not clear whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes of the Senate's vote, allowing Vice-President Mike Pens to change the insolvency and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea "declined" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Yong-un came to power seven years ago, said South Korean envoy.
Park Beong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Unitedation Ministry, suggested that last year there were 1.127 crossings to the border compared to 2011 when there was 2.706.
Mr. Park said the striking border controls between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs of human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang didn't comment publicly.
Most of the North Korean refugees have been receiving citizenship in South Korea.
Seul says that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee across China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can be easier to cross compared to the well protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them to force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have significantly improved in the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the subjects focusing on the delay of denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Tramp and Kim Yong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the Korean Poluotok without nuclear weapons.
But the Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Yong-ho accused on Saturday sanctions imposed by the United States for stagnating progress from now on.
"If there is no confidence in the United States; there will be no trust in our national security and in such conditions, we cannot unilaterally disarma ourselves first," Mr. Ree said in the speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavano "hysterical" and says he is not suitable to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Cavano "hysterical" and said that, taking into account his temperament, he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday's "Texas Tribune Festival" in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't have thought that if a woman had acted that way, they would say she was "hysterical," Pelosi said to her response to Cavano's testimony before the Senate's Committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally denyed the allegations that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blacy Ford when they were teenagers.
Cavano was very emotional in his introduction exhibition, sometimes even screaming and screaming when he talked about his family and his high school age.
He also clearly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the indications against it "grotesk and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by the Liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost at presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Cavano's testimony was proof that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he proved to be astray against democrats.
"I think he disqualifys himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question whether she would try to remove Cavano from function if the indications against him were confirmed and if the democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth before the Congress or before the FBI, then he is not only suitable to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is not even suitable to serve in the court where he is at the moment," Pelosi said.
Cavano is now a judge at the District Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she is concerned about the possible verdicts that Cavano will bring against the Law of Accession Health or Roe against Wade, because he is considered subject to conservative justice.
In his candidacy confirmation hearings, Cavano did not answer questions about whether he would cancel some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, extraordinary man to enter the court and expect us to say, "that's really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
Women should use it, too.
It's really acute criticism, months and years of gathering anger, which she can't free from herself without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “It helped me a woman who was doing an executive function somewhere and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she managed to develop her technique, so when she became angry and crying, she tells the person with whom she talks, “You might think I am sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think it's genius."
The tears are permitted as an outbreak of anger partly because they are in fact misinterpreted.
One of my most clear memories of one of my first jobs in the office where men dominated is when I once started crying with an unreasonable anger and an older woman, a cold manager from which I always had a certain fear, caught me for my neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they've managed to reach you."
Patricia Schroeder was a democratic congresswoman from Colorado during that period and worked with Gary Hart at his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extra-marriage affair called "Monkey Business" and retired from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she didn't think about the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well-considered decision," he said to me 30 years later through the laugh.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and Seven Packages."
Given the fact that the campaign has been launched a long time ago, it has not had enough funds, so she promised that she would not enter the race if she didn't gather two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000, would only give it $250.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she asked.
During the speech in which he announced that it would not start a formal campaign it was so overwhelmed by emotions, or thanks to people who supported her, frustration from the system that was so difficult to gather funds and to target voters, not delegates and anger to sexism, she began to cry.
"If you saw me, you would probably think I had a nervous breakthrough," Mrs. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted to the event.
"You'd think "Clinex" is my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my graveboard.
"She's crying?"
As a trade war between the United States and China can be a good job for Beijing
The opening of the fire at the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China was deprivative, even though the battle is far from the end, the conflict among countries can be useful for Beijing on a long-term basis, experts say.
Donald Tramp, US President, gave the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The situation was significantly escalated during this week by introducing new goods tariffs worth $200 billion (150 billion), which effectively taxed half of the goods coming from China.
Beijing returned to nature every time, or recently imposed five to ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China promised to return to the United States equally, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will quit the same soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting his requests, but public worship before the United States would be too embarrassed for Xie Jinping, Chinese president.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Peking plays well, pressures from trade war with the United States can result in positive support for China on a long-term basis because the interdependence of both economies will reduce.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for starting a sudden decline from a economic perspective in which any of the countries is much more dangerous than the observers had previously established," Abigail Grace, a research collaborator focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security, which represents a tink-tank.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister said
Syria says she is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and endeavours to help renew the country that remains devastated by the long war that lasted over seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
"The situation in the field today is stable and safer, due to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the condition to normality.

This year was really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy that we brought the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy to help," the emotional Garcia said after the winning of Europe.

During one period this morning, we made the Europe’s team difficulty.
We fought.
The hat down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really good.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the American Professional Golf Association and our Rider Cup committee, and we'll continue.

We have to confess to them.
We're overwhelmed.
